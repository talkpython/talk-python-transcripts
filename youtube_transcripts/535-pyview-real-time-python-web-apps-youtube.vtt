WEBVTT

00:00:01.019 --> 00:00:02.740
<v Michael Kennedy>Larry, welcome to Talk Python To Me.

00:00:03.010 --> 00:00:03.580
<v Michael Kennedy>Awesome to have you here.

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:04.840
<v Michael Kennedy>Yeah, thanks, Michael.

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:05.480
<v Michael Kennedy>It's great to be here.

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:06.520
<v Michael Kennedy>Yeah.

00:00:07.779 --> 00:00:11.640
<v Michael Kennedy>I saw your project, PyView, and you're like, oh, hey,

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:13.160
<v Michael Kennedy>maybe you could just give it a little shout out.

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:15.840
<v Michael Kennedy>I'm like, this is super neat, the way this thing works.

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:19.280
<v Michael Kennedy>And as most people know who listen,

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:20.780
<v Michael Kennedy>I'm a big fan of web development.

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:23.840
<v Michael Kennedy>The last episode that we just released,

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:28.680
<v Michael Kennedy>not actually the one, time shifting

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:30.920
<v Michael Kennedy>because of recording podcasts, was with all the creators

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:33.620
<v Michael Kennedy>of the popular Python web frameworks as a panel.

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:35.120
<v Michael Kennedy>And that was super popular.

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:38.720
<v Michael Kennedy>So here we are back with another web topic, PyView.

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:42.480
<v Michael Kennedy>And it's got a really, really unique twist.

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:47.020
<v Michael Kennedy>And I think people are going to dig it.

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:48.220
<v Michael Kennedy>It's quite interesting.

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.760
<v Larry Ogrodnek>Yeah, thanks.

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:53.920
<v Larry Ogrodnek>No, yeah, I think I've been doing technology for a long time

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:56.340
<v Larry Ogrodnek>now, and I think the web has always just been amazing.

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:57.660
<v Larry Ogrodnek>It's an amazing platform.

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:03.300
<v Larry Ogrodnek>And so I think that's why people kind of gravitate towards, you know, web frameworks and interesting

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:06.280
<v Larry Ogrodnek>web technologies and what can you do now and how can we make it easier?

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:07.540
<v Larry Ogrodnek>And yeah, it's funny.

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:11.060
<v Larry Ogrodnek>I did think PyView would resonate with you a little bit just because I know that, I don't

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:15.400
<v Larry Ogrodnek>know if this is true, but it seems like you do appreciate really not just like, you know,

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:19.560
<v Larry Ogrodnek>obviously Python, but web technologies and especially like embracing web technologies

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.480
<v Larry Ogrodnek>and maybe not necessarily kind of hiding them.

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:24.240
<v Larry Ogrodnek>Yeah, exactly.

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:37.820
<v Michael Kennedy>That is one of the things that really appealed to me because there are some Python frameworks that build webmaps, but their goal is to pretend that HTML and CSS is really bad.

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:39.420
<v Michael Kennedy>It's like, you don't want to write a simile.

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:40.660
<v Michael Kennedy>We're going to put that away from you.

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:44.700
<v Michael Kennedy>You don't need to see this HTML or the CSS or any of those things.

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.640
<v Michael Kennedy>Get it away.

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.680
<v Michael Kennedy>And I feel like something is lost there.

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:53.280
<v Michael Kennedy>Building on the web is just like the perfect clay.

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:57.820
<v Michael Kennedy>It is so malleable and it can become almost anything

00:01:58.040 --> 00:01:58.780
<v Michael Kennedy>that you want it to be.

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:02.420
<v Michael Kennedy>And a lot of those frameworks, I think they just miss that.

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:04.040
<v Michael Kennedy>And I don't feel like what you built does.

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:07.520
<v Michael Kennedy>So I think we're having a good time talking about it.

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:08.660
<v Larry Ogrodnek>LARRY HOCHBERGER: No, thanks.

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:09.640
<v Larry Ogrodnek>Yeah, I'm excited to get into it.

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:12.620
<v Michael Kennedy>JOHN MCCUTCHAN: But quick introduction.

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:14.060
<v Michael Kennedy>Larry, who are you?

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:14.920
<v Larry Ogrodnek>What do you feel?

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:17.880
<v Larry Ogrodnek>LARRY HOCHBERGER: Yeah, so my name is Larry O'Granick.

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:21.040
<v Larry Ogrodnek>I've been a software developer for, I guess,

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:22.600
<v Larry Ogrodnek>let's just say over 25 years now.

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:27.680
<v Larry Ogrodnek>I won't age myself too much, but through that time, obviously, I've done a bunch of different things.

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:30.040
<v Larry Ogrodnek>I worked at startups.

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:31.060
<v Larry Ogrodnek>I worked at big companies.

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:34.060
<v Larry Ogrodnek>I've been freelancing for a few years even.

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:45.280
<v Larry Ogrodnek>And so my early career was more kind of on the C pro side, a lot of back-end work, diving into Java and then Scala.

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:52.740
<v Larry Ogrodnek>And when I was doing freelancing, obviously, the language of the tech kind of depended on what the client wanted to do.

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:54.200
<v Larry Ogrodnek>and what the project entailed.

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:57.320
<v Larry Ogrodnek>But that's kind of when I started to get more serious about using Python.

00:02:58.879 --> 00:03:02.700
<v Larry Ogrodnek>And, you know, nowadays I work at a startup in the construction industry.

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:04.360
<v Larry Ogrodnek>Oh, really?

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:05.100
<v Larry Ogrodnek>Yeah.

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:09.840
<v Larry Ogrodnek>But we're really trying to invest heavily in technology and software.

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:12.460
<v Larry Ogrodnek>Like, we're trying to be a technology-enabled home builder.

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:14.580
<v Larry Ogrodnek>And so we have a huge investment.

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:17.820
<v Larry Ogrodnek>And we have, I mean, you know, not necessarily a huge tech team,

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:24.800
<v Larry Ogrodnek>But, you know, spending any money and employment on tech is kind of a big deal in this industry.

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:32.440
<v Larry Ogrodnek>And I think it's an industry that hasn't really had technology, you know, get great adoption.

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:35.400
<v Larry Ogrodnek>You know, different people are doing different things.

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:40.060
<v Larry Ogrodnek>But overall, there's been a hard time to kind of get it in that process.

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:41.360
<v Larry Ogrodnek>But there's a lot of areas for improvement.

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:45.220
<v Larry Ogrodnek>And so, you know, we're trying to make that process better, faster, smoother.

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:55.720
<v Michael Kennedy>yeah i think there's a lot of possibility for pick your underserved by tech specialization and build

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:00.680
<v Michael Kennedy>businesses around there if if you're a python developer or any kind of developer but if

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:07.920
<v Michael Kennedy>if you really have the skill to build things like connecting apis and automations and and stuff

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:14.120
<v Michael Kennedy>it's it's just such fertile ground it's like wow there's nobody building stuff here that is like

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:20.440
<v Larry Ogrodnek>good let's go i could do this right 100 and i think yeah like to maybe to your point there's a

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:24.580
<v Larry Ogrodnek>lot of kind of low-hanging fruit or it's just like just even getting some of the information in people's

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:30.060
<v Larry Ogrodnek>heads in a structured way and even having like different processes defined in a structured way

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:34.760
<v Larry Ogrodnek>like you get huge improvements from that and this is kind of just like why we love technology right

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:38.740
<v Larry Ogrodnek>is you have these building blocks and it's like oh now that we have this in a structured format we

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:42.440
<v Larry Ogrodnek>can actually do these interesting things with it that we couldn't do before because it was just you

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:43.640
<v Larry Ogrodnek>on someone's notepad or whatever.

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:46.140
<v Larry Ogrodnek>And so yeah, you're right.

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:48.000
<v Larry Ogrodnek>I think there's still a lot of issues like that.

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:49.600
<v Larry Ogrodnek>And home building is for sure a big one.

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:53.420
<v Larry Ogrodnek>And yeah, it's been interesting.

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:56.880
<v Larry Ogrodnek>I mean, our main actually construction platform

00:04:57.780 --> 00:04:59.500
<v Larry Ogrodnek>that manages our construction projects--

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:02.000
<v Larry Ogrodnek>so we have an interesting part of that, what you were saying,

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:05.000
<v Larry Ogrodnek>is it can be hard in underserved technologies.

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:08.780
<v Larry Ogrodnek>There are underserved areas to have that domain expertise.

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:10.100
<v Larry Ogrodnek>And so you have to find a good partner.

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:13.200
<v Larry Ogrodnek>And one of the things we've done is we actually build the homes.

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:17.640
<v Larry Ogrodnek>So we're not just writing software for other builders to use, but we're building homes ourselves.

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:23.400
<v Larry Ogrodnek>And that's been a huge benefit because we have people building homes that we can sit down with and say, like, does this make sense?

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:25.220
<v Larry Ogrodnek>Like, does it not make sense? Like, why, why not?

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:30.900
<v Larry Ogrodnek>And, you know, we have to obviously push on both sides sometimes because we are trying to change things, right?

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:35.820
<v Larry Ogrodnek>But that's been, I think it'd be almost impossible to do without.

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:40.880
<v Michael Kennedy>It's the dog fooding equivalent, the software dog fooding, right?

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:41.320
<v Michael Kennedy>Exactly.

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:42.500
<v Michael Kennedy>You're building.

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:45.620
<v Michael Kennedy>They're building your building, so then you can.

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:48.680
<v Larry Ogrodnek>I know, and it can be frustrating to get these phone calls like,

00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:49.400
<v Larry Ogrodnek>why is this working?

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:51.400
<v Larry Ogrodnek>Are you going to make me late for this or that?

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:55.700
<v Larry Ogrodnek>But again, having those really strong partnerships, I don't know,

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:57.680
<v Larry Ogrodnek>it's critical to be able to get something that actually works.

00:05:58.540 --> 00:06:00.620
<v Michael Kennedy>Yeah, well, it sounds actually super exciting.

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:01.460
<v Michael Kennedy>I mean, I know you sold it.

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:03.920
<v Michael Kennedy>It's like, oh, we're just building, just working in the building.

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:05.180
<v Michael Kennedy>No, this is cool.

00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:06.360
<v Larry Ogrodnek>It's cool.

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:11.500
<v Larry Ogrodnek>Yeah, and for the last couple of years, I've been doing a lot on our kind of more AI services team.

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:20.980
<v Larry Ogrodnek>And I'm not a machine learning researcher, but most of the work I've been doing has been around kind of productionizing that work and building services around it.

00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:28.180
<v Larry Ogrodnek>And we've done really cool stuff like with, I mean, just like pricing models for the homes, which is kind of more traditional machine learning stuff.

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:30.460
<v Larry Ogrodnek>and then like schedule simulation stuff.

00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:33.400
<v Larry Ogrodnek>And more recently, a lot of LLM-based stuff,

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:37.680
<v Larry Ogrodnek>both for kind of like, you know, rag style chat workflows.

00:06:37.890 --> 00:06:39.360
<v Larry Ogrodnek>Like you can imagine you're in the field and you're like,

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:41.760
<v Larry Ogrodnek>you know, is this the right tile pattern?

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:46.300
<v Larry Ogrodnek>And maybe that's buried on like page 500 of a Google spreadsheet

00:06:46.390 --> 00:06:47.100
<v Larry Ogrodnek>or something like that.

00:06:47.130 --> 00:06:48.660
<v Larry Ogrodnek>And being able to pull that quickly is huge.

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:51.280
<v Larry Ogrodnek>And now some of the stuff we're trying to do

00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:54.180
<v Larry Ogrodnek>is more around automating schedule updates.

00:06:54.530 --> 00:06:56.740
<v Larry Ogrodnek>So someone can kind of walk through a home

00:06:56.760 --> 00:06:59.420
<v Larry Ogrodnek>and just do kind of stream of consciousness like,

00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:02.140
<v Larry Ogrodnek>this is the status of like this,

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:05.340
<v Larry Ogrodnek>this is running late, whatever.

00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:08.340
<v Larry Ogrodnek>And then we have a multi-stage process,

00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:11.420
<v Larry Ogrodnek>but we kind of turn the video into images

00:07:11.700 --> 00:07:13.240
<v Larry Ogrodnek>and turn the transcription into notes

00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:17.100
<v Larry Ogrodnek>and then try and see what's in the photo.

00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:18.960
<v Larry Ogrodnek>Is that the right tile pattern?

00:07:19.380 --> 00:07:20.340
<v Larry Ogrodnek>Is that the right stove?

00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:23.720
<v Larry Ogrodnek>And use LLMs for different parts of this process

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.240
<v Larry Ogrodnek>to kind of come up with recommendations at the end.

00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:31.680
<v Larry Ogrodnek>oh it actually looks like the drywall was is totally installed and we can mark that as done

00:07:31.860 --> 00:07:37.680
<v Larry Ogrodnek>or or whatever and you know having the automation is actually super helpful because having up-to-date

00:07:37.860 --> 00:07:43.180
<v Larry Ogrodnek>schedules drives a lot of stuff right it's just like the efficiency of having making sure people

00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:49.960
<v Larry Ogrodnek>are on site and not delayed uh is huge so that's so many touch points of so many subcontractors

00:07:50.580 --> 00:07:54.699
<v Michael Kennedy>and things right like when is the plumber gonna be here well they need to be here when the

00:07:54.680 --> 00:08:03.200
<v Michael Kennedy>inspection for plumbing is here. But that got you know, like, it's people who haven't gone through like, somehow some kind of a house and I got a big

00:08:05.540 --> 00:08:13.420
<v Michael Kennedy>home home improvements, not quite the right word. But like this big out outside projects with like a barbecue thing and so on done. And

00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:17.120
<v Michael Kennedy>wow, after doing that, I'm like, there's I've got a lot of ideas for making this.

00:08:19.479 --> 00:08:23.660
<v Larry Ogrodnek>No, I know, right. And some of those delays are like super costly. And it's funny, because like a lot of things in

00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:28.340
<v Larry Ogrodnek>In terms of like budgeting, like if you buy too much material, that's bad because you're wasting money.

00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:38.180
<v Larry Ogrodnek>But if you buy too little, that's actually even worse because like maybe, you know, you need more whatever lumber and maybe there's, you know, two weeks, you know, turnaround time to get it.

00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:45.300
<v Larry Ogrodnek>And so. Yeah. And again, if you have to reschedule things like inspections, who knows when the next available one is, it might push the project out, you know, weeks.

00:08:45.580 --> 00:08:47.800
<v Larry Ogrodnek>And so, yeah, there's a lot of interdependencies,

00:08:47.950 --> 00:08:48.940
<v Larry Ogrodnek>and a lot of, like you said, people.

00:08:49.050 --> 00:08:53.720
<v Larry Ogrodnek>And communication remains a very tricky problem.

00:08:54.720 --> 00:08:55.740
<v Larry Ogrodnek>That's always one of the things.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:58.300
<v Michael Kennedy>Well, it sounds awesome.

00:08:58.740 --> 00:09:01.420
<v Michael Kennedy>And I'm also interested to see if your project at all

00:09:02.180 --> 00:09:02.680
<v Michael Kennedy>touches on that.

00:09:03.130 --> 00:09:04.500
<v Michael Kennedy>But let's dive in.

00:09:04.830 --> 00:09:06.220
<v Michael Kennedy>Let's dive into PyView.

00:09:06.380 --> 00:09:08.760
<v Michael Kennedy>Now, the first thing I want to point out here with PyView

00:09:09.780 --> 00:09:13.480
<v Michael Kennedy>is it is not PyWebView, which has been around for three or four

00:09:13.700 --> 00:09:14.340
<v Michael Kennedy>years at minimum.

00:09:14.700 --> 00:09:16.820
<v Michael Kennedy>And I imagine that a lot of people have seen this.

00:09:17.340 --> 00:09:20.460
<v Michael Kennedy>PyWebView is a way to embed basically a browser

00:09:21.610 --> 00:09:24.320
<v Michael Kennedy>into something that you can wrap as a desktop app.

00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:26.620
<v Michael Kennedy>PyView, totally different.

00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:28.400
<v Michael Kennedy>What's the elevator pitch in PyView?

00:09:28.590 --> 00:09:29.940
<v Michael Kennedy>TREVOR GARCIA: Totally different, yeah.

00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:33.320
<v Larry Ogrodnek>So the elevator pitch in PyView is basically--

00:09:33.880 --> 00:09:35.460
<v Larry Ogrodnek>it's one of those self-referential things.

00:09:35.580 --> 00:09:37.160
<v Larry Ogrodnek>Hopefully I won't try and say Phoenix LiveView.

00:09:38.339 --> 00:09:42.100
<v Larry Ogrodnek>But when you're building modern web apps--

00:09:42.100 --> 00:09:44.660
<v Larry Ogrodnek>and this is one of the things that I have seen--

00:09:45.140 --> 00:09:47.080
<v Larry Ogrodnek>if you want to have this rich interactivity,

00:09:47.930 --> 00:09:50.600
<v Larry Ogrodnek>you want to have a really rich client experience,

00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:53.520
<v Larry Ogrodnek>maybe you reach for something like React or Vue.

00:09:53.780 --> 00:09:54.820
<v Larry Ogrodnek>Those are great frameworks,

00:09:55.660 --> 00:09:57.040
<v Larry Ogrodnek>but then you also have your backend server

00:09:57.210 --> 00:09:59.020
<v Larry Ogrodnek>maybe managing the state and the database

00:09:59.320 --> 00:09:59.880
<v Larry Ogrodnek>and those relationships,

00:10:00.230 --> 00:10:01.220
<v Larry Ogrodnek>maybe talking to other servers,

00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:03.680
<v Larry Ogrodnek>maybe that's in Python or another language, whatever.

00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:07.460
<v Larry Ogrodnek>You have to manage these two different pieces

00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:08.920
<v Larry Ogrodnek>and they each have their own state.

00:10:11.540 --> 00:10:12.920
<v Larry Ogrodnek>There can be a lot of complexity

00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:16.640
<v Larry Ogrodnek>when you, yeah, the client is showing something

00:10:16.750 --> 00:10:18.580
<v Larry Ogrodnek>slightly different than the server or vice versa

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.080
<v Larry Ogrodnek>and having to synchronize that state and keep them in sync.

00:10:21.960 --> 00:10:24.360
<v Larry Ogrodnek>Plus, often there's a lot of glue code in between them, right?

00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:27.540
<v Larry Ogrodnek>Like having to just go from the Python backend

00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:30.840
<v Larry Ogrodnek>to the jobs frontend and back and forth.

00:10:32.140 --> 00:10:33.420
<v Larry Ogrodnek>Even when things are in the same language,

00:10:33.630 --> 00:10:36.080
<v Larry Ogrodnek>like I've worked on TypeScript apps

00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:37.380
<v Larry Ogrodnek>where it's TypeScript backend and frontend,

00:10:37.520 --> 00:10:40.300
<v Larry Ogrodnek>it's kind of rare that you actually share a lot of code

00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:41.880
<v Larry Ogrodnek>for that layer.

00:10:42.180 --> 00:10:44.260
<v Larry Ogrodnek>things end up drifting anyway and being different.

00:10:45.620 --> 00:10:48.060
<v Larry Ogrodnek>And so PyView, the idea is,

00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:53.820
<v Larry Ogrodnek>what if you can have your backend server

00:10:54.870 --> 00:10:55.740
<v Larry Ogrodnek>manage all your state,

00:10:56.320 --> 00:10:58.020
<v Larry Ogrodnek>you're writing all your application logic in Python,

00:10:58.820 --> 00:11:01.500
<v Larry Ogrodnek>you're just rendering HTML like you would for a static site,

00:11:04.040 --> 00:11:06.080
<v Larry Ogrodnek>but when different interactions happen,

00:11:06.190 --> 00:11:10.680
<v Larry Ogrodnek>like when user clicks a button or enters a form field

00:11:10.740 --> 00:11:12.880
<v Larry Ogrodnek>or different things happen on the friend end.

00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:15.360
<v Larry Ogrodnek>We send an event to the server.

00:11:16.240 --> 00:11:18.300
<v Larry Ogrodnek>The server processes the event and changes its state.

00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:20.820
<v Larry Ogrodnek>So for example, maybe, I mean, it's a simple counter example,

00:11:20.980 --> 00:11:23.500
<v Larry Ogrodnek>but you press plus on the counter.

00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:26.500
<v Larry Ogrodnek>Then the server increments the count by one.

00:11:26.720 --> 00:11:31.620
<v Larry Ogrodnek>It does a full re-render, but it does kind of a diff and says,

00:11:31.760 --> 00:11:33.660
<v Larry Ogrodnek>"Oh, actually, looking at this full page,

00:11:34.240 --> 00:11:37.240
<v Larry Ogrodnek>all I need to do is tell the friend to change zero to one."

00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:41.040
<v Larry Ogrodnek>And so it efficiently sends that over a WebSocket connection.

00:11:41.570 --> 00:11:44.760
<v Larry Ogrodnek>And I feel like there's already a lot there that maybe that wasn't the clearest description.

00:11:44.910 --> 00:11:49.140
<v Larry Ogrodnek>But the idea is kind of more like, can we get SPA-level interactivity,

00:11:50.640 --> 00:11:55.260
<v Larry Ogrodnek>including things like multi-user presence stuff, server push, really fast UI updates,

00:11:55.950 --> 00:11:59.060
<v Larry Ogrodnek>really fast local navigation, not doing full page reloads.

00:11:59.780 --> 00:12:03.620
<v Larry Ogrodnek>But on the back end, our mental model really is something like a traditional static,

00:12:03.900 --> 00:12:09.700
<v Larry Ogrodnek>you know not static site generator but like a static rendering um thing so i don't know

00:12:10.460 --> 00:12:20.960
<v Michael Kennedy>was that clear yeah i think uh yes it sounds like a lot and what i think is cool about pi view

00:12:21.920 --> 00:12:27.520
<v Michael Kennedy>is that it takes a lot of that and it just makes it automatic over a simple programming api right

00:12:28.560 --> 00:12:32.360
<v Larry Ogrodnek>yeah exactly so that's the thing is you don't have to think about a lot of this kind of plumbing

00:12:33.100 --> 00:12:35.520
<v Larry Ogrodnek>And this is the one kind of -- I mean, we'll get into this more.

00:12:35.720 --> 00:12:36.920
<v Larry Ogrodnek>Like, this is something that I --

00:12:37.120 --> 00:12:37.900
<v Larry Ogrodnek>an idea that I came up with.

00:12:37.920 --> 00:12:40.480
<v Larry Ogrodnek>This is something that has been around for a little while

00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:43.180
<v Larry Ogrodnek>on the Elixir side.

00:12:43.380 --> 00:12:45.620
<v Larry Ogrodnek>It comes from this thing called Phoenix Live View.

00:12:45.820 --> 00:12:49.120
<v Larry Ogrodnek>But, yeah, you know, a framework actually can take care

00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:50.340
<v Larry Ogrodnek>of a lot of this for us.

00:12:50.420 --> 00:12:53.020
<v Larry Ogrodnek>And so, as developers, all we really need to worry about

00:12:53.240 --> 00:12:56.320
<v Larry Ogrodnek>is updating our state when events, you know, come in,

00:12:57.840 --> 00:13:00.980
<v Larry Ogrodnek>and rendering, you know, doing a render of --

00:13:00.980 --> 00:13:01.920
<v Larry Ogrodnek>this is, you know, given the state,

00:13:02.100 --> 00:13:03.300
<v Larry Ogrodnek>what should we render to the back end?

00:13:03.350 --> 00:13:06.260
<v Larry Ogrodnek>And the framework manages the WebSecret connection.

00:13:06.390 --> 00:13:07.300
<v Larry Ogrodnek>It manages the messages.

00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:09.520
<v Larry Ogrodnek>It manages doing the diffing.

00:13:09.950 --> 00:13:11.540
<v Larry Ogrodnek>And so we don't have to think about any of that.

00:13:12.340 --> 00:13:15.020
<v Larry Ogrodnek>We really just need to think about how do I update my state

00:13:15.440 --> 00:13:17.740
<v Larry Ogrodnek>and how do I render the website?

00:13:18.140 --> 00:13:20.280
<v Larry Ogrodnek>And so it ends up being really powerful just having

00:13:20.310 --> 00:13:21.460
<v Larry Ogrodnek>these very simple building blocks.

00:13:22.240 --> 00:13:23.860
<v Larry Ogrodnek>And this is the kind of thing that--

00:13:25.340 --> 00:13:26.880
<v Larry Ogrodnek>I mean, I'm not anti-JavaScript in general,

00:13:27.300 --> 00:13:29.140
<v Larry Ogrodnek>but obviously we're using JavaScript on the front end.

00:13:29.280 --> 00:13:34.520
<v Larry Ogrodnek>But by having this very kind of generic JavaScript layer that just knows really simple things like,

00:13:36.100 --> 00:13:42.320
<v Larry Ogrodnek>here's how I send messages when a button is pressed or when a text field changes.

00:13:42.960 --> 00:13:48.580
<v Larry Ogrodnek>There's very simple building blocks, but you end up being this very powerful system when you bring them together.

00:13:48.780 --> 00:13:54.420
<v Larry Ogrodnek>And you don't really have to write JavaScript for live interactions because, again, most of the things are very simple.

00:13:54.660 --> 00:13:56.880
<v Larry Ogrodnek>It's like, you know, I need to change whatever.

00:13:58.140 --> 00:13:58.340
<v Michael Kennedy>Yeah.

00:13:58.440 --> 00:14:08.520
<v Michael Kennedy>Yeah. So your project is pretty new, which I'm hoping to shine a light on it because I think it's going to get a lot of attention out in the audience.

00:14:10.660 --> 00:14:17.260
<v Michael Kennedy>Alessio points out that, hey, this is kind of like HTMX and Django with fragments, but over WebSockets.

00:14:18.520 --> 00:14:23.040
<v Michael Kennedy>And yeah, I feel like it does have some HTMX vibes.

00:14:23.720 --> 00:14:24.980
<v Michael Kennedy>And for those of you who haven't tried it,

00:14:25.140 --> 00:14:28.100
<v Michael Kennedy>HTMX is like, you sprinkle just a couple of extra attributes

00:14:28.380 --> 00:14:30.220
<v Michael Kennedy>on there, and then somehow behind the scenes,

00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:33.560
<v Michael Kennedy>there's additional communication that you don't worry about.

00:14:33.720 --> 00:14:36.060
<v Michael Kennedy>It's just say, oh, if somebody clicks this image,

00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:39.740
<v Michael Kennedy>actually do this server thing and replace part of the page--

00:14:39.940 --> 00:14:41.200
<v Michael Kennedy>maybe the image, maybe something else--

00:14:41.660 --> 00:14:43.300
<v Michael Kennedy>with the server HTML response.

00:14:44.340 --> 00:14:47.780
<v Michael Kennedy>How do you feel that PyView, Phoenix LiveView

00:14:48.120 --> 00:14:50.980
<v Michael Kennedy>sort of relates to that, and like Datastar,

00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:52.519
<v Michael Kennedy>who I'm going to have on the--

00:14:52.540 --> 00:14:54.000
<v Larry Ogrodnek>Yeah, no, I think that's right.

00:14:54.190 --> 00:14:57.980
<v Larry Ogrodnek>I think that's a very thoughtful comment

00:14:58.030 --> 00:15:00.080
<v Larry Ogrodnek>because I think that is a lot of it.

00:15:00.080 --> 00:15:02.800
<v Larry Ogrodnek>And if I had to think in terms of comparisons

00:15:04.060 --> 00:15:05.200
<v Larry Ogrodnek>to different frameworks,

00:15:05.390 --> 00:15:07.660
<v Larry Ogrodnek>I think doing something with HTMX

00:15:07.870 --> 00:15:10.440
<v Larry Ogrodnek>probably is the closest comparison

00:15:10.610 --> 00:15:12.880
<v Larry Ogrodnek>because, again, it's HTML-based.

00:15:13.940 --> 00:15:16.960
<v Larry Ogrodnek>We are responding to events

00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:18.060
<v Larry Ogrodnek>and wiring up to the server

00:15:18.400 --> 00:15:21.020
<v Larry Ogrodnek>and processing them and sending back HTML fragments.

00:15:21.880 --> 00:15:23.780
<v Larry Ogrodnek>I think the difference is that

00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:25.760
<v Larry Ogrodnek>PyView is a little more structured, right?

00:15:25.920 --> 00:15:26.980
<v Larry Ogrodnek>Because with HTMLX,

00:15:29.279 --> 00:15:30.860
<v Larry Ogrodnek>you have a lot more control,

00:15:31.140 --> 00:15:31.880
<v Larry Ogrodnek>which can be a good thing,

00:15:32.440 --> 00:15:36.580
<v Larry Ogrodnek>but you're wiring up these things

00:15:36.880 --> 00:15:38.280
<v Larry Ogrodnek>yourself to a certain extent saying,

00:15:38.310 --> 00:15:40.400
<v Larry Ogrodnek>like, when you click on this,

00:15:41.140 --> 00:15:44.240
<v Larry Ogrodnek>call this back-end route and replace

00:15:44.390 --> 00:15:48.240
<v Larry Ogrodnek>the contents of this element with the response from that.

00:15:48.540 --> 00:15:51.020
<v Larry Ogrodnek>On the back-end, you're sending full HTML,

00:15:51.300 --> 00:15:51.960
<v Larry Ogrodnek>and things like that.

00:15:51.960 --> 00:15:52.860
<v Larry Ogrodnek>So that's one difference.

00:15:53.820 --> 00:15:56.760
<v Larry Ogrodnek>So yes, it is over WebSockets, PyView versus HTMX.

00:15:57.320 --> 00:16:01.680
<v Larry Ogrodnek>The other thing is we do have this kind of diffing technology

00:16:02.020 --> 00:16:04.660
<v Larry Ogrodnek>where we're only sending what actually changed.

00:16:07.379 --> 00:16:11.540
<v Larry Ogrodnek>So we can go into more detail at some point

00:16:11.540 --> 00:16:12.540
<v Larry Ogrodnek>about how the templating works.

00:16:12.760 --> 00:16:15.260
<v Larry Ogrodnek>But for something like changing from 0 to 1,

00:16:15.380 --> 00:16:18.280
<v Larry Ogrodnek>it's like we're really just sending back the 1.

00:16:19.100 --> 00:16:20.500
<v Larry Ogrodnek>And obviously, as the page gets more complex,

00:16:22.060 --> 00:16:24.420
<v Larry Ogrodnek>the diffs get more complex, but we're just sending the diffs.

00:16:24.820 --> 00:16:27.240
<v Larry Ogrodnek>And again, the framework kind of handles--

00:16:27.400 --> 00:16:29.580
<v Larry Ogrodnek>as a developer, you don't have to think about what part of the page

00:16:29.640 --> 00:16:30.860
<v Larry Ogrodnek>do I update.

00:16:31.100 --> 00:16:32.980
<v Larry Ogrodnek>And it's kind of encoded to a certain extent in your template,

00:16:34.899 --> 00:16:37.600
<v Larry Ogrodnek>but it's kind of more hands off.

00:16:37.700 --> 00:16:39.180
<v Larry Ogrodnek>And so you do give up some flexibility,

00:16:39.400 --> 00:16:42.620
<v Larry Ogrodnek>but then the framework kind of gets

00:16:42.700 --> 00:16:47.440
<v Larry Ogrodnek>to handle a lot of things for you in a smoother integrated way,

00:16:47.480 --> 00:16:48.020
<v Larry Ogrodnek>I would say.

00:16:48.780 --> 00:16:50.800
<v Michael Kennedy>Yeah, just handles it.

00:16:50.810 --> 00:16:52.980
<v Michael Kennedy>Yeah, with HTMX, which I am a fan of,

00:16:54.500 --> 00:16:56.440
<v Michael Kennedy>you have to think about every little piece.

00:16:57.570 --> 00:17:00.380
<v Michael Kennedy>And you say, if somebody interacts with this part,

00:17:00.430 --> 00:17:02.100
<v Michael Kennedy>then I want this action to happen.

00:17:02.290 --> 00:17:03.660
<v Michael Kennedy>And then this thing over here, you know,

00:17:03.860 --> 00:17:05.620
<v Michael Kennedy>these parts of the pages are going to be

00:17:06.220 --> 00:17:10.439
<v Michael Kennedy>where the response of the server gets redirected back into.

00:17:11.040 --> 00:17:14.280
<v Michael Kennedy>And it seems like it's more just handled a little bit here.

00:17:15.040 --> 00:17:17.459
<v Michael Kennedy>Let's talk a little bit about Phoenix Live View.

00:17:17.939 --> 00:17:29.620
<v Michael Kennedy>Because while your project is pretty new, Phoenix Live View has, I don't know how old it is, a couple years it looks like, but it's got 6,700 stars.

00:17:29.880 --> 00:17:32.280
<v Michael Kennedy>So it's a really solid foundation.

00:17:32.920 --> 00:17:38.020
<v Michael Kennedy>And your project, what's the relationship between PyView and Phoenix Live View?

00:17:38.680 --> 00:17:38.880
<v Larry Ogrodnek>Right.

00:17:39.020 --> 00:17:41.880
<v Larry Ogrodnek>So Live View is obviously the inspiration for PyView.

00:17:42.180 --> 00:17:49.640
<v Larry Ogrodnek>I think when I started thinking about there's got to be a better way to building these kinds

00:17:49.660 --> 00:17:54.580
<v Larry Ogrodnek>of apps in Python, I came across Phoenix Live View and really loved this model.

00:17:54.900 --> 00:17:58.560
<v Larry Ogrodnek>Especially just, I don't know, I do like thinking this event based system.

00:17:59.620 --> 00:18:03.140
<v Larry Ogrodnek>And it seemed like you get all the really nice things for free.

00:18:03.240 --> 00:18:04.140
<v Larry Ogrodnek>So it definitely was the inspiration.

00:18:04.540 --> 00:18:08.319
<v Larry Ogrodnek>And then when I started working on PyView, I had the thought like, well, they've already

00:18:08.340 --> 00:18:13.680
<v Larry Ogrodnek>kind of figured out a good model for how this works and how things fit together. And they

00:18:13.680 --> 00:18:19.980
<v Larry Ogrodnek>already have a good client side story for implementing the client side component of this. So what

00:18:19.980 --> 00:18:26.140
<v Larry Ogrodnek>I tried to do with PyView is actually use, you know, I ship their, the Phoenix LiveView

00:18:26.610 --> 00:18:31.560
<v Larry Ogrodnek>front end client JavaScript is what you're running in a PyView app on your front end.

00:18:32.080 --> 00:18:36.640
<v Larry Ogrodnek>And I kind of implemented a Python backend. So if you think about LiveView as a protocol,

00:18:37.060 --> 00:18:38.080
<v Larry Ogrodnek>which to be clear, it is not.

00:18:38.600 --> 00:18:40.420
<v Larry Ogrodnek>Like, there's sort of just some, you know,

00:18:40.700 --> 00:18:42.900
<v Larry Ogrodnek>have to do some reverse engineering of how things work.

00:18:43.320 --> 00:18:44.120
<v Larry Ogrodnek>It's not really documented.

00:18:44.240 --> 00:18:45.380
<v Larry Ogrodnek>Because I think, you know, on their end,

00:18:45.720 --> 00:18:48.620
<v Larry Ogrodnek>it really is an internal implementation detail

00:18:48.900 --> 00:18:50.840
<v Larry Ogrodnek>about how the front end communicates with the back end.

00:18:52.840 --> 00:18:55.560
<v Larry Ogrodnek>But, you know, we get the-- that really was a huge boost

00:18:55.860 --> 00:18:58.300
<v Larry Ogrodnek>for me because I get to use their client JavaScript,

00:18:58.520 --> 00:19:00.020
<v Larry Ogrodnek>which handles all the diffing.

00:19:00.580 --> 00:19:02.360
<v Larry Ogrodnek>And again, a big part of it too is just kind of they

00:19:02.840 --> 00:19:03.640
<v Larry Ogrodnek>do have a really nice design.

00:19:04.480 --> 00:19:06.200
<v Larry Ogrodnek>So like you mentioned, yeah, Phoenix Live View's been around

00:19:06.220 --> 00:19:06.660
<v Larry Ogrodnek>for a while.

00:19:07.180 --> 00:19:08.260
<v Larry Ogrodnek>It's a very popular project.

00:19:08.370 --> 00:19:10.360
<v Larry Ogrodnek>I think if you are in this ecosystem--

00:19:10.360 --> 00:19:15.100
<v Larry Ogrodnek>so it's written in Elixir, which is a different programming

00:19:15.300 --> 00:19:18.960
<v Larry Ogrodnek>language that runs on the Erlang virtual machine.

00:19:19.180 --> 00:19:22.060
<v Larry Ogrodnek>And just to be clear, it's a totally great language.

00:19:22.540 --> 00:19:23.780
<v Larry Ogrodnek>It has a lot of really cool features.

00:19:24.100 --> 00:19:25.280
<v Larry Ogrodnek>It's nothing against Elixir.

00:19:25.460 --> 00:19:27.900
<v Larry Ogrodnek>It's just that for different reasons,

00:19:28.260 --> 00:19:32.140
<v Larry Ogrodnek>I wanted this paradigm in the Python world,

00:19:32.320 --> 00:19:33.500
<v Larry Ogrodnek>because I'm working-- especially at work,

00:19:33.620 --> 00:19:34.500
<v Larry Ogrodnek>I'm working on Python apps.

00:19:34.780 --> 00:19:36.400
<v Larry Ogrodnek>And that's the kind of world I live in.

00:19:36.540 --> 00:19:40.780
<v Larry Ogrodnek>And we can't change everything over to different languages.

00:19:41.180 --> 00:19:43.240
<v Michael Kennedy>Well, I'll throw it out there for you.

00:19:43.240 --> 00:19:44.560
<v Michael Kennedy>You don't have to take the bullets.

00:19:44.710 --> 00:19:47.940
<v Michael Kennedy>But I think functional programming languages

00:19:48.130 --> 00:19:49.120
<v Michael Kennedy>are super interesting.

00:19:49.760 --> 00:19:55.240
<v Michael Kennedy>They apply really well in certain to solve certain problems.

00:19:55.350 --> 00:19:58.960
<v Michael Kennedy>And I know some people, it's the hammer for all nails.

00:19:59.960 --> 00:20:02.820
<v Michael Kennedy>But for most people, functional programming

00:20:02.840 --> 00:20:04.780
<v Michael Kennedy>is just not what they're working in.

00:20:06.820 --> 00:20:08.720
<v Michael Kennedy>Things where you can change variables and have state

00:20:09.400 --> 00:20:15.040
<v Michael Kennedy>turn out to be more productive ways to write code,

00:20:15.380 --> 00:20:19.920
<v Michael Kennedy>even if it maybe is not provably as correct or as thread safe

00:20:20.140 --> 00:20:20.540
<v Michael Kennedy>or whatever.

00:20:21.160 --> 00:20:23.280
<v Michael Kennedy>So if most people are going to adopt it,

00:20:23.320 --> 00:20:27.080
<v Michael Kennedy>most people are not using functional programming languages

00:20:27.360 --> 00:20:30.600
<v Michael Kennedy>and Erlang in particular, Python happens

00:20:30.660 --> 00:20:31.960
<v Michael Kennedy>to be more popular than Erlang.

00:20:32.660 --> 00:21:00.260
<v Larry Ogrodnek>Yeah. Yeah. I'll let you take those bullets, Michael. But yeah, I mean, look, different languages are good for different use cases, right? But again, I think it's a really great idea that I thought, let me steal this. And so, yeah, this is something that was written by, I think, Chris McCord is like the author of Live View. And it's been around, yeah, for a long time. It's gone through different iterations. But yeah, it's incredibly popular in that ecosystem. And yeah, they've done, I think, really great things with it.

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:02.460
<v Michael Kennedy>Yeah, and let's--

00:21:02.970 --> 00:21:04.080
<v Michael Kennedy>I just want to give a little shout out.

00:21:04.180 --> 00:21:06.780
<v Michael Kennedy>If you go to the Phoenix Live View GitHub, which of course

00:21:06.860 --> 00:21:08.860
<v Michael Kennedy>I'll link in the show notes, there's

00:21:09.330 --> 00:21:12.600
<v Michael Kennedy>a live demo on-fly that you can check out.

00:21:12.670 --> 00:21:14.840
<v Michael Kennedy>And there's also a two-minute video.

00:21:16.140 --> 00:21:17.280
<v Michael Kennedy>Watch the two-minute video.

00:21:18.120 --> 00:21:23.400
<v Michael Kennedy>It really shows, like, OK, this is quite an interesting

00:21:23.900 --> 00:21:25.560
<v Michael Kennedy>and quite capable technology.

00:21:25.590 --> 00:21:28.020
<v Michael Kennedy>It might sound like, oh, you can't do very much with this,

00:21:28.160 --> 00:21:33.240
<v Michael Kennedy>because, I don't know, it seems like it's only built to make a few things easy.

00:21:34.020 --> 00:21:38.180
<v Michael Kennedy>After watching what he built there with this app with Phoenix Live View,

00:21:38.240 --> 00:21:38.880
<v Michael Kennedy>I was impressed.

00:21:39.180 --> 00:21:39.760
<v Michael Kennedy>It's quite flexible.

00:21:40.460 --> 00:21:41.140
<v Larry Ogrodnek>No, for sure.

00:21:41.320 --> 00:21:43.380
<v Larry Ogrodnek>And I think it took a lot of work to get there too, right,

00:21:43.600 --> 00:21:45.900
<v Larry Ogrodnek>just to give them a lot of credit.

00:21:46.780 --> 00:21:48.380
<v Larry Ogrodnek>Because a lot of the things, I mean, it's interesting

00:21:48.500 --> 00:21:51.000
<v Larry Ogrodnek>because once you take this approach to having everything over WebSockets,

00:21:51.740 --> 00:21:52.800
<v Larry Ogrodnek>well, then actually it's pretty great

00:21:53.020 --> 00:21:54.860
<v Larry Ogrodnek>because it opens up a lot of things that could be hard,

00:21:55.180 --> 00:22:00.180
<v Larry Ogrodnek>things like presence, knowing different users that are on the same documenter page as you,

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:01.820
<v Larry Ogrodnek>or server pushes.

00:22:01.970 --> 00:22:07.040
<v Larry Ogrodnek>You get a lot of that stuff, not for free, but it's easy when that's your base layer

00:22:07.040 --> 00:22:08.240
<v Larry Ogrodnek>is everything over WebSockets.

00:22:08.400 --> 00:22:14.020
<v Larry Ogrodnek>But then some things like file uploads, as part of this they invented a way to do file

00:22:14.160 --> 00:22:15.340
<v Larry Ogrodnek>uploads over WebSockets.

00:22:15.780 --> 00:22:16.760
<v Michael Kennedy>Oh, that's interesting.

00:22:17.559 --> 00:22:21.400
<v Larry Ogrodnek>Yeah, because how do you do that?

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:24.560
<v Larry Ogrodnek>WebSockets do support both text and binary messages.

00:22:24.800 --> 00:22:25.780
<v Larry Ogrodnek>So it's not as crazy as you would think,

00:22:25.920 --> 00:22:26.840
<v Larry Ogrodnek>but there is a limit to--

00:22:26.990 --> 00:22:28.800
<v Larry Ogrodnek>you have to chunk it and stuff like that.

00:22:30.580 --> 00:22:32.080
<v Larry Ogrodnek>But so it supports that.

00:22:33.110 --> 00:22:34.420
<v Larry Ogrodnek>I mean, again, we can talk more about file,

00:22:34.520 --> 00:22:36.760
<v Larry Ogrodnek>but is there other options for also going direct to S3

00:22:36.970 --> 00:22:38.220
<v Larry Ogrodnek>or different things?

00:22:39.460 --> 00:22:41.260
<v Larry Ogrodnek>But yeah, a lot of work has gone into this,

00:22:41.740 --> 00:22:42.600
<v Larry Ogrodnek>including around the optimization.

00:22:42.930 --> 00:22:44.140
<v Larry Ogrodnek>Like, what is that message format?

00:22:44.300 --> 00:22:46.900
<v Larry Ogrodnek>How do you send minimal diffs for not just things

00:22:47.120 --> 00:22:49.380
<v Larry Ogrodnek>like simple template changes, but when

00:22:49.380 --> 00:22:53.559
<v Larry Ogrodnek>you have lists or components or maybe

00:22:53.580 --> 00:22:57.520
<v Larry Ogrodnek>of huge lists of things, how do you efficiently manage that

00:22:57.550 --> 00:22:59.580
<v Larry Ogrodnek>on both the server side and the client side?

00:22:59.740 --> 00:23:02.660
<v Larry Ogrodnek>And so I think there's a lot of great ideas for dealing

00:23:02.820 --> 00:23:05.100
<v Larry Ogrodnek>with this that were pioneered by Phoenix Live View

00:23:05.240 --> 00:23:08.880
<v Larry Ogrodnek>that I get to come along and just steal.

00:23:09.410 --> 00:23:10.440
<v Larry Ogrodnek>JOHN MUELLER: That's cool.

00:23:10.600 --> 00:23:11.480
<v Michael Kennedy>Here's the Python version.

00:23:12.540 --> 00:23:13.420
<v Larry Ogrodnek>Yeah, exactly.

00:23:13.650 --> 00:23:16.540
<v Larry Ogrodnek>And I think that was a lot of the focus early on

00:23:16.700 --> 00:23:18.880
<v Larry Ogrodnek>was trying to stick to this just because, again,

00:23:19.440 --> 00:23:23.100
<v Larry Ogrodnek>PyView, like you said, it is very early days.

00:23:23.320 --> 00:23:25.080
<v Larry Ogrodnek>And it is just kind of like a personal side project.

00:23:25.350 --> 00:23:27.000
<v Larry Ogrodnek>Although I am using it at my day job

00:23:27.160 --> 00:23:30.280
<v Larry Ogrodnek>for a couple of production apps now, which has been fantastic.

00:23:30.520 --> 00:23:36.400
<v Larry Ogrodnek>But as a single developer with Python

00:23:36.560 --> 00:23:38.000
<v Larry Ogrodnek>with a side project, it was great

00:23:38.120 --> 00:23:41.560
<v Larry Ogrodnek>to have a little bit of a roadmap on if I follow these patterns,

00:23:41.780 --> 00:23:42.900
<v Larry Ogrodnek>I'm probably going to end up in a good place.

00:23:43.860 --> 00:23:48.060
<v Larry Ogrodnek>Of course, I did try and make things more Pythonic where I

00:23:48.320 --> 00:23:48.420
<v Larry Ogrodnek>could.

00:23:50.780 --> 00:23:52.640
<v Larry Ogrodnek>So PyView is very heavily typed.

00:23:53.160 --> 00:23:54.980
<v Larry Ogrodnek>So we're using obviously Python types for everything,

00:23:55.240 --> 00:23:59.720
<v Larry Ogrodnek>whereas Elixir, I think they're adding types now.

00:23:59.880 --> 00:24:02.800
<v Larry Ogrodnek>It's been an ongoing thing to add some gradual typing

00:24:02.860 --> 00:24:03.700
<v Larry Ogrodnek>like Python has done.

00:24:05.059 --> 00:24:07.060
<v Larry Ogrodnek>But Python is a little further along in terms

00:24:07.200 --> 00:24:08.300
<v Larry Ogrodnek>of the typing story there.

00:24:09.040 --> 00:24:11.420
<v Larry Ogrodnek>And I think over time, maybe we'll

00:24:12.300 --> 00:24:14.260
<v Larry Ogrodnek>diverge a little bit in terms of making the APIs more

00:24:15.620 --> 00:24:17.540
<v Larry Ogrodnek>Pythonic to the extent anything is not.

00:24:18.440 --> 00:24:20.559
<v Larry Ogrodnek>But yeah, for sure, having this kind of at least

00:24:20.580 --> 00:24:24.380
<v Larry Ogrodnek>this core level protocol has been useful to follow.

00:24:25.880 --> 00:24:31.040
<v Michael Kennedy>Yeah, they've kind of worked out how the exchange works

00:24:31.220 --> 00:24:32.020
<v Michael Kennedy>and all those different things.

00:24:32.160 --> 00:24:33.120
<v Michael Kennedy>You're like, OK, let me do the--

00:24:33.140 --> 00:24:34.560
<v Michael Kennedy>Yeah, and I sort of have a roadmap to,

00:24:34.800 --> 00:24:36.000
<v Larry Ogrodnek>oh, these are the problems you're going to get into.

00:24:36.260 --> 00:24:37.800
<v Larry Ogrodnek>Because that's when I first started PyView.

00:24:40.360 --> 00:24:42.080
<v Larry Ogrodnek>So I did start it a couple years ago,

00:24:43.780 --> 00:24:46.180
<v Larry Ogrodnek>but again, very sparse.

00:24:46.320 --> 00:24:49.180
<v Larry Ogrodnek>Like, can I get anything to show up on the page over WebSockets?

00:24:49.300 --> 00:24:50.460
<v Larry Ogrodnek>and then kind of iterated.

00:24:50.920 --> 00:24:52.180
<v Larry Ogrodnek>And it's interesting to--

00:24:52.430 --> 00:24:54.540
<v Larry Ogrodnek>when I started the first version of the LiveView client

00:24:54.660 --> 00:24:56.440
<v Larry Ogrodnek>JavaScript they used, then figuring out

00:24:56.540 --> 00:24:58.300
<v Larry Ogrodnek>what changed between that and the next version

00:24:58.350 --> 00:24:59.480
<v Larry Ogrodnek>and the next version and the next version.

00:24:59.660 --> 00:25:02.020
<v Larry Ogrodnek>You get to see the gradual progression of, oh,

00:25:02.110 --> 00:25:03.200
<v Larry Ogrodnek>these are some problems we're going to run into,

00:25:03.680 --> 00:25:06.080
<v Larry Ogrodnek>because they've sort of addressed that in this future version.

00:25:06.450 --> 00:25:07.500
<v Larry Ogrodnek>But I still have to deal with it.

00:25:08.120 --> 00:25:09.100
<v Larry Ogrodnek>But I'll get there at some point.

00:25:09.600 --> 00:25:11.660
<v Michael Kennedy>Yeah, go look at the closed GitHub issues.

00:25:11.840 --> 00:25:13.380
<v Michael Kennedy>You're like, whoa, there's a lot of conversation

00:25:13.470 --> 00:25:13.960
<v Michael Kennedy>around this one.

00:25:14.880 --> 00:25:15.240
<v Larry Ogrodnek>Yeah.

00:25:15.760 --> 00:25:16.120
<v Michael Kennedy>Interesting.

00:25:18.040 --> 00:25:21.540
<v Michael Kennedy>So I think a nice thing to do for people

00:25:21.920 --> 00:25:24.340
<v Michael Kennedy>would be to just do a quick walkthrough,

00:25:24.700 --> 00:25:27.960
<v Michael Kennedy>because you've got a nice little getting started thing.

00:25:28.480 --> 00:25:31.640
<v Michael Kennedy>We've just got to be careful that most people are listening,

00:25:31.860 --> 00:25:32.180
<v Michael Kennedy>not seeing.

00:25:32.720 --> 00:25:33.680
<v Michael Kennedy>But let's talk through--

00:25:34.220 --> 00:25:35.960
<v Michael Kennedy>let's maybe talk through what it means to create just

00:25:36.030 --> 00:25:38.820
<v Michael Kennedy>like a real simple program in PyView.

00:25:40.520 --> 00:25:40.960
<v Larry Ogrodnek>Sure.

00:25:41.460 --> 00:25:43.940
<v Larry Ogrodnek>Yeah, so I do--

00:25:43.940 --> 00:25:45.160
<v Larry Ogrodnek>yeah, so the documentation is something, again,

00:25:45.360 --> 00:25:45.940
<v Larry Ogrodnek>it's a work in progress.

00:25:46.200 --> 00:25:48.200
<v Larry Ogrodnek>But I did try to get started getting some things together.

00:25:49.160 --> 00:25:51.120
<v Larry Ogrodnek>So yeah, I do have a cookie cutter project.

00:25:51.300 --> 00:25:52.940
<v Larry Ogrodnek>And I think the first one in documentation,

00:25:53.840 --> 00:25:55.220
<v Larry Ogrodnek>if you check out the cookie cutter project,

00:25:55.240 --> 00:26:01.540
<v Larry Ogrodnek>it gives you a very quick project set up.

00:26:02.640 --> 00:26:03.380
<v Larry Ogrodnek>Sorry, I'm just going--

00:26:03.380 --> 00:26:04.460
<v Michael Kennedy>Yeah, for people who don't know,

00:26:04.740 --> 00:26:08.900
<v Michael Kennedy>cookie cutter is a way to take a pre-structured set of source

00:26:09.320 --> 00:26:11.980
<v Michael Kennedy>files of all varieties, even images and other things,

00:26:12.600 --> 00:26:14.380
<v Michael Kennedy>and say, I'm going to ask you a few questions.

00:26:14.740 --> 00:26:15.580
<v Michael Kennedy>I'm going to do a little text replace.

00:26:16.020 --> 00:26:17.840
<v Michael Kennedy>and I'm gonna generate that structure for you.

00:26:18.080 --> 00:26:20.880
<v Michael Kennedy>So a very nice way to kind of go like,

00:26:21.100 --> 00:26:22.180
<v Michael Kennedy>all right, we got everything set up

00:26:22.640 --> 00:26:23.540
<v Michael Kennedy>for you to get started, right?

00:26:24.380 --> 00:26:24.840
<v Larry Ogrodnek>- Right, exactly.

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:26.140
<v Larry Ogrodnek>'Cause I really wanted to get, you know,

00:26:26.600 --> 00:26:28.780
<v Larry Ogrodnek>like part of the thought with Pyview

00:26:28.860 --> 00:26:31.560
<v Larry Ogrodnek>is I really do want it to be super easy to get started,

00:26:32.420 --> 00:26:35.260
<v Larry Ogrodnek>not just for other people, but also for myself, right?

00:26:35.360 --> 00:26:36.760
<v Larry Ogrodnek>Like if I have a new idea of something,

00:26:36.940 --> 00:26:38.840
<v Larry Ogrodnek>it's like I wanna go from zero to one super quickly,

00:26:38.900 --> 00:26:40.340
<v Larry Ogrodnek>and that's kind of been part of the motivation.

00:26:40.440 --> 00:26:41.920
<v Larry Ogrodnek>And so this cookie cutter is a great way to,

00:26:42.720 --> 00:26:43.640
<v Larry Ogrodnek>so you check out the cookie cutter,

00:26:43.920 --> 00:26:46.480
<v Larry Ogrodnek>And then you basically have a working example right away

00:26:46.700 --> 00:26:47.640
<v Larry Ogrodnek>with just the simple counter.

00:26:47.730 --> 00:26:52.400
<v Larry Ogrodnek>And so this example uses poetry for dependency management.

00:26:52.720 --> 00:26:56.900
<v Larry Ogrodnek>So if you do poetry install, and then it also

00:26:57.100 --> 00:26:58.920
<v Larry Ogrodnek>includes Just, which is a command line runner.

00:26:59.820 --> 00:27:01.100
<v Larry Ogrodnek>So Just, it's kind of like--

00:27:01.170 --> 00:27:02.040
<v Larry Ogrodnek>I don't know if you've talked about this before,

00:27:02.320 --> 00:27:05.960
<v Larry Ogrodnek>but if anyone's ever used Make Files or things like that

00:27:06.840 --> 00:27:11.340
<v Larry Ogrodnek>for doing common project tasks, Just is a tool like that,

00:27:11.500 --> 00:27:14.620
<v Larry Ogrodnek>but specifically written for these types of things.

00:27:14.690 --> 00:27:16.760
<v Larry Ogrodnek>And so if you use make files, you know there's

00:27:16.880 --> 00:27:19.880
<v Larry Ogrodnek>a lot of tricks you have to do to get it to work in the way

00:27:19.920 --> 00:27:21.700
<v Larry Ogrodnek>you want versus as a build tool.

00:27:22.120 --> 00:27:26.020
<v Larry Ogrodnek>And so Just kind of works the right way a lot easier

00:27:26.240 --> 00:27:27.000
<v Larry Ogrodnek>and something that kind of--

00:27:27.020 --> 00:27:27.540
<v Larry Ogrodnek>Yeah, exactly.

00:27:27.980 --> 00:27:28.820
<v Larry Ogrodnek>--we can be using more and more.

00:27:29.450 --> 00:27:31.460
<v Larry Ogrodnek>So if you check out the-- if you run the cookie cutter,

00:27:32.420 --> 00:27:33.920
<v Larry Ogrodnek>run poetry install, and then run Just,

00:27:34.680 --> 00:27:39.600
<v Larry Ogrodnek>it'll tell you to open localhost to 8,000 in your browser.

00:27:39.740 --> 00:27:41.760
<v Larry Ogrodnek>and you'll have a counter example up and running already.

00:27:43.520 --> 00:27:44.820
<v Larry Ogrodnek>And the kind of interesting thing,

00:27:44.910 --> 00:27:47.960
<v Larry Ogrodnek>if you want to play along with this more--

00:27:47.960 --> 00:27:50.500
<v Larry Ogrodnek>and I do have this in the docs in terms of what's going on here--

00:27:50.500 --> 00:27:55.320
<v Larry Ogrodnek>but it's a really good example to open up in Firefox or Chrome,

00:27:56.200 --> 00:28:01.240
<v Larry Ogrodnek>and then open the developer tools and the network tab.

00:28:02.640 --> 00:28:07.159
<v Larry Ogrodnek>And when you load the page, what you'll see is--

00:28:07.180 --> 00:28:09.820
<v Larry Ogrodnek>And this is kind of the live view motto is, right?

00:28:10.420 --> 00:28:15.140
<v Larry Ogrodnek>There's an initial page load, which is like the server.

00:28:15.530 --> 00:28:20.160
<v Larry Ogrodnek>So it goes to your view and it runs your templating logic.

00:28:20.450 --> 00:28:23.500
<v Larry Ogrodnek>And it returns that as just straight HTML, like a normal web page.

00:28:23.640 --> 00:28:27.280
<v Larry Ogrodnek>So if you turned off JavaScript, you'd still get the page back.

00:28:28.540 --> 00:28:30.140
<v Larry Ogrodnek>But if you have JavaScript on, which is obviously intention,

00:28:30.770 --> 00:28:34.600
<v Larry Ogrodnek>then what happens is included in that initial page load is some JavaScript that comes back.

00:28:35.060 --> 00:28:35.800
<v Larry Ogrodnek>Oh, so you have it open, Michael.

00:28:35.850 --> 00:28:35.980
<v Larry Ogrodnek>Yeah.

00:28:36.030 --> 00:28:36.440
<v Larry Ogrodnek>So if you...

00:28:36.500 --> 00:28:36.700
<v Larry Ogrodnek>There you go.

00:28:36.800 --> 00:28:37.720
<v Larry Ogrodnek>Yeah, exactly.

00:28:38.390 --> 00:28:39.820
<v Larry Ogrodnek>So the HTML is right there.

00:28:39.930 --> 00:28:41.440
<v Larry Ogrodnek>So that's like the full HTML of the page.

00:28:41.550 --> 00:28:42.700
<v Larry Ogrodnek>So yeah, if you had turned off JavaScript,

00:28:42.980 --> 00:28:44.040
<v Larry Ogrodnek>that part would still work.

00:28:44.520 --> 00:28:45.920
<v Larry Ogrodnek>But then if you click on the--

00:28:46.310 --> 00:28:48.620
<v Larry Ogrodnek>do you see in there a WebSocket connection in your--

00:28:48.660 --> 00:28:49.220
<v Larry Ogrodnek>Oh, yeah.

00:28:50.020 --> 00:28:50.180
<v Michael Kennedy>Somewhere.

00:28:50.560 --> 00:28:50.800
<v Michael Kennedy>Socket.

00:28:50.930 --> 00:28:51.060
<v Michael Kennedy>Yep.

00:28:51.620 --> 00:28:53.720
<v Larry Ogrodnek>So if you click on that, you can see the messages back and forth.

00:28:53.840 --> 00:28:55.920
<v Larry Ogrodnek>So you click on the Messages tab there.

00:28:56.420 --> 00:28:56.780
<v Larry Ogrodnek>Yeah.

00:28:57.250 --> 00:28:59.100
<v Larry Ogrodnek>And so you can see--

00:28:59.360 --> 00:28:59.860
<v Michael Kennedy>It's resting.

00:29:00.580 --> 00:29:00.700
<v Michael Kennedy>Right.

00:29:01.220 --> 00:29:01.540
<v Michael Kennedy>Yeah.

00:29:02.320 --> 00:29:04.980
<v Michael Kennedy>So there's a whole set of examples

00:29:05.680 --> 00:29:07.380
<v Michael Kennedy>or live interactive examples,

00:29:07.760 --> 00:29:09.680
<v Michael Kennedy>and people can just go to pyv.rocks

00:29:09.700 --> 00:29:13.020
<v Michael Kennedy>and click live examples and do this to see it, right?

00:29:13.380 --> 00:29:13.620
<v Larry Ogrodnek>- Yeah.

00:29:14.180 --> 00:29:15.540
<v Michael Kennedy>- Yeah, okay, this is super cool.

00:29:15.680 --> 00:29:16.640
<v Larry Ogrodnek>- You can see that message you have right there,

00:29:16.640 --> 00:29:18.040
<v Larry Ogrodnek>it says diff zero one.

00:29:18.540 --> 00:29:21.220
<v Larry Ogrodnek>So like zero is like the kind of slot in the template.

00:29:21.840 --> 00:29:23.160
<v Larry Ogrodnek>And so it says, now that should be one.

00:29:23.260 --> 00:29:24.200
<v Larry Ogrodnek>So you click, you know, plus again,

00:29:24.300 --> 00:29:26.020
<v Larry Ogrodnek>then the new message will be diff, you know, whatever.

00:29:26.500 --> 00:29:28.460
<v Larry Ogrodnek>And you can see this message says event increment.

00:29:29.260 --> 00:29:30.579
<v Larry Ogrodnek>So this is what goes to your backend

00:29:30.600 --> 00:29:34.080
<v Larry Ogrodnek>you're getting a click event for increment and you're sending back a response.

00:29:35.980 --> 00:29:36.340
<v Michael Kennedy>And so, yeah.

00:29:36.580 --> 00:29:43.260
<v Michael Kennedy>So does it like instrument your HTML with like a bunch of identifiers or something like that to then be able to do this?

00:29:43.780 --> 00:29:43.980
<v Larry Ogrodnek>Yeah.

00:29:44.110 --> 00:29:52.060
<v Larry Ogrodnek>And so that was one of the things that like I was I've been so unhappy with for a while with PyView is because like when I first started doing this,

00:29:52.150 --> 00:29:54.680
<v Larry Ogrodnek>I was like, OK, I want a nice HTML templating language.

00:29:54.890 --> 00:29:55.000
<v Larry Ogrodnek>Right.

00:29:55.860 --> 00:29:58.420
<v Larry Ogrodnek>And or maybe even it'd be better if it was pluggable,

00:29:58.600 --> 00:30:00.540
<v Larry Ogrodnek>if you could use like whatever templating language you want.

00:30:00.620 --> 00:30:04.420
<v Larry Ogrodnek>But the problem is, is most Python templating languages,

00:30:05.260 --> 00:30:07.440
<v Larry Ogrodnek>kind of the input is, you know, like your template

00:30:07.760 --> 00:30:11.240
<v Larry Ogrodnek>and, you know, some data and the output is like a string.

00:30:12.380 --> 00:30:14.460
<v Larry Ogrodnek>And for this, what we're trying to produce

00:30:14.980 --> 00:30:16.120
<v Larry Ogrodnek>is like a render tree.

00:30:16.900 --> 00:30:20.820
<v Larry Ogrodnek>And so really the mental model is a lot more like t-strings.

00:30:21.720 --> 00:30:22.800
<v Larry Ogrodnek>If people are familiar with t-strings,

00:30:23.180 --> 00:30:25.480
<v Larry Ogrodnek>where you have like a template, right?

00:30:25.720 --> 00:30:29.800
<v Larry Ogrodnek>your HTML template, and it's separated into static parts,

00:30:30.360 --> 00:30:33.720
<v Larry Ogrodnek>like strings, and dynamic parts, like things to be evaluated.

00:30:34.700 --> 00:30:36.180
<v Larry Ogrodnek>And that's kind of the LiveView model.

00:30:36.240 --> 00:30:38.980
<v Larry Ogrodnek>And the PyView model is like, basically, we take a template

00:30:39.320 --> 00:30:41.560
<v Larry Ogrodnek>and we convert it into a list of statics and dynamics.

00:30:41.720 --> 00:30:45.960
<v Larry Ogrodnek>And each dynamic, like each evaluation spot itself,

00:30:47.260 --> 00:30:49.080
<v Larry Ogrodnek>has static parts and dynamic parts.

00:30:50.720 --> 00:30:52.180
<v Larry Ogrodnek>And so we have to take an HTML template

00:30:52.300 --> 00:30:53.800
<v Larry Ogrodnek>and turn it into this render tree.

00:30:54.680 --> 00:30:59.300
<v Larry Ogrodnek>And so, again, this is like a huge pain point

00:30:59.580 --> 00:31:01.880
<v Larry Ogrodnek>because I couldn't find a templating language

00:31:02.040 --> 00:31:03.200
<v Larry Ogrodnek>that would let me kind of get that level of control.

00:31:03.370 --> 00:31:05.120
<v Larry Ogrodnek>And maybe there is one and I'm not familiar with it,

00:31:05.120 --> 00:31:07.040
<v Larry Ogrodnek>or maybe there is a way to get to these internals

00:31:07.060 --> 00:31:07.720
<v Larry Ogrodnek>and I'm not familiar with it.

00:31:07.860 --> 00:31:13.280
<v Larry Ogrodnek>But what I am doing was there is this library called IBIS,

00:31:13.360 --> 00:31:16.620
<v Larry Ogrodnek>which someone had wrote an open source

00:31:16.790 --> 00:31:18.420
<v Larry Ogrodnek>as like a kind of tutorial on how to write

00:31:18.450 --> 00:31:19.220
<v Larry Ogrodnek>your own templating language.

00:31:20.580 --> 00:31:23.720
<v Larry Ogrodnek>And so it's very similar to Jinja 2, but a lot simpler.

00:31:23.900 --> 00:31:25.880
<v Larry Ogrodnek>And so that was the initial template and language for PyView

00:31:26.100 --> 00:31:32.300
<v Larry Ogrodnek>because I could kind of hack it just enough to get both HTML

00:31:32.860 --> 00:31:38.020
<v Larry Ogrodnek>and also this kind of more template-like view that I need.

00:31:38.680 --> 00:31:40.860
<v Larry Ogrodnek>This is one of the things that I'm very excited about with,

00:31:41.180 --> 00:31:42.980
<v Larry Ogrodnek>like now that we have t-strings in 3.14,

00:31:44.900 --> 00:31:48.580
<v Larry Ogrodnek>is that I think that model, I mean, just maps so directly to this,

00:31:48.640 --> 00:31:51.100
<v Larry Ogrodnek>and I'm hopeful that we'll have a lot of different rendering libraries

00:31:52.060 --> 00:31:53.180
<v Larry Ogrodnek>or templating language for HTML.

00:31:53.860 --> 00:31:57.640
<v Larry Ogrodnek>Like I know there's already a good one, or it's a work in progress called TDOM

00:31:58.940 --> 00:32:04.180
<v Larry Ogrodnek>that people are working on to make kind of t-strings more HTML, not friendly,

00:32:04.250 --> 00:32:07.120
<v Larry Ogrodnek>not that they're not already, but there are certain things you want.

00:32:07.290 --> 00:32:11.620
<v Larry Ogrodnek>Like obviously you want to be able to just do all that escaping of user input

00:32:11.870 --> 00:32:16.200
<v Larry Ogrodnek>so it's not malicious, maybe even merging things in HTML attributes.

00:32:16.520 --> 00:32:20.340
<v Larry Ogrodnek>There's nicer things you can kind of do when you're thinking about the HTML use case, right?

00:32:21.160 --> 00:32:25.140
<v Larry Ogrodnek>But I like having a template as the core building block,

00:32:25.210 --> 00:32:26.280
<v Larry Ogrodnek>because if you can get to a template,

00:32:26.880 --> 00:32:29.620
<v Larry Ogrodnek>that's super easy to turn into the structure we need for a live view.

00:32:30.500 --> 00:32:33.500
<v Larry Ogrodnek>And I imagine there'll be multiple ways to do that in the future.

00:32:34.740 --> 00:32:35.940
<v Michael Kennedy>Yeah, very interesting.

00:32:36.110 --> 00:32:41.460
<v Michael Kennedy>It sounds a little bit like almost a concrete syntax tree of the DOM

00:32:41.600 --> 00:32:44.020
<v Michael Kennedy>that you've got to like, okay, we've got to understand all the pieces

00:32:44.470 --> 00:32:47.480
<v Michael Kennedy>and what parts get pushed down.

00:32:47.940 --> 00:32:50.660
<v Michael Kennedy>from here down as the chunk we got to send down

00:32:50.830 --> 00:32:53.860
<v Larry Ogrodnek>because this part changed and so on.

00:32:53.930 --> 00:32:54.060
<v Larry Ogrodnek>Exactly, exactly.

00:32:54.770 --> 00:32:56.460
<v Larry Ogrodnek>And yeah, like you said, it is a little bit like that.

00:32:56.460 --> 00:32:57.840
<v Larry Ogrodnek>I mean, because there's, you know,

00:32:57.980 --> 00:32:59.260
<v Larry Ogrodnek>it's not even as simple as like this,

00:32:59.490 --> 00:33:00.800
<v Larry Ogrodnek>because there is like some special handling

00:33:00.980 --> 00:33:05.580
<v Larry Ogrodnek>for things like components, you know,

00:33:06.440 --> 00:33:08.200
<v Larry Ogrodnek>are sort of managed slightly differently.

00:33:08.710 --> 00:33:10.240
<v Larry Ogrodnek>And then even kind of that, like if you had,

00:33:11.060 --> 00:33:12.100
<v Larry Ogrodnek>this is like not a great example,

00:33:12.130 --> 00:33:13.480
<v Larry Ogrodnek>but if you had multiple counters on your page,

00:33:14.080 --> 00:33:15.560
<v Larry Ogrodnek>maybe you'd want to optimize like,

00:33:15.740 --> 00:33:18.760
<v Larry Ogrodnek>well, they really just need one set of static content

00:33:18.940 --> 00:33:20.480
<v Larry Ogrodnek>for all the counters, even though we

00:33:20.580 --> 00:33:21.540
<v Larry Ogrodnek>kind of want to manage them separately.

00:33:21.630 --> 00:33:22.960
<v Larry Ogrodnek>And so there's different optimizations

00:33:23.070 --> 00:33:23.800
<v Larry Ogrodnek>like that that are done.

00:33:23.960 --> 00:33:27.720
<v Larry Ogrodnek>But yeah, everything comes from this kind of render tree

00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:29.800
<v Larry Ogrodnek>is how we can do those diffs.

00:33:30.560 --> 00:33:30.920
<v Michael Kennedy>OK.

00:33:32.260 --> 00:33:34.100
<v Michael Kennedy>Let's talk through these examples a tad more.

00:33:34.420 --> 00:33:36.640
<v Michael Kennedy>And we don't necessarily need this going.

00:33:37.230 --> 00:33:39.040
<v Michael Kennedy>But back to the--

00:33:39.980 --> 00:33:41.980
<v Michael Kennedy>Alessio pointed out, the HTMX example.

00:33:42.180 --> 00:33:47.580
<v Michael Kennedy>If you go to the HCMX website, there's a bunch of cool live examples there as well.

00:33:47.670 --> 00:33:53.460
<v Michael Kennedy>And literally in the page, Carson has put it such that you see these exchanges as you interact with it.

00:33:53.470 --> 00:33:53.860
<v Michael Kennedy>You know what I mean?

00:33:53.930 --> 00:33:56.260
<v Michael Kennedy>Like, that's like how significant that is.

00:33:56.700 --> 00:34:04.740
<v Michael Kennedy>So maybe let's pick out just a couple of the examples here that we could talk through that you think are worth pointing out.

00:34:04.740 --> 00:34:07.840
<v Michael Kennedy>Some of the capabilities are inspiring but not insane.

00:34:08.399 --> 00:34:08.620
<v Michael Kennedy>Sure.

00:34:09.149 --> 00:34:11.899
<v Larry Ogrodnek>I mean, like a really quick one is this volume control.

00:34:12.139 --> 00:34:13.000
<v Larry Ogrodnek>like the third one up at the top,

00:34:13.139 --> 00:34:15.740
<v Larry Ogrodnek>which is just, it's not like a super interesting example,

00:34:16.080 --> 00:34:17.899
<v Larry Ogrodnek>but just the thing that I like about it

00:34:18.060 --> 00:34:20.220
<v Larry Ogrodnek>is that it has like keyboard control.

00:34:20.460 --> 00:34:21.480
<v Larry Ogrodnek>So you can see like, you know,

00:34:21.659 --> 00:34:24.040
<v Larry Ogrodnek>it's super easy to just do keyboard bindings.

00:34:24.120 --> 00:34:25.860
<v Larry Ogrodnek>And this is one of those things where like-

00:34:25.860 --> 00:34:27.260
<v Larry Ogrodnek>- Just arrow keys.

00:34:27.360 --> 00:34:28.860
<v Larry Ogrodnek>- Yeah, I mean, which seems like a small thing.

00:34:28.860 --> 00:34:30.120
<v Michael Kennedy>- Not using the mouse, folks.

00:34:30.740 --> 00:34:31.260
<v Larry Ogrodnek>There it goes.

00:34:31.260 --> 00:34:31.980
<v Larry Ogrodnek>- Seems like a small thing,

00:34:31.980 --> 00:34:32.899
<v Larry Ogrodnek>but it's one of those things

00:34:32.899 --> 00:34:35.200
<v Larry Ogrodnek>when you start to dive into, right?

00:34:35.300 --> 00:34:37.860
<v Larry Ogrodnek>Like, you know, even like, you know,

00:34:38.080 --> 00:34:39.100
<v Larry Ogrodnek>sometimes you might wonder like, you know,

00:34:39.100 --> 00:34:41.240
<v Larry Ogrodnek>why are there all these different HTML component libraries

00:34:41.540 --> 00:34:45.820
<v Larry Ogrodnek>just like, well, you know, when you want to think about things like accessibility and

00:34:45.919 --> 00:34:48.560
<v Larry Ogrodnek>different languages and blah, blah, blah, like there's actually a lot that goes into it.

00:34:48.600 --> 00:34:53.860
<v Larry Ogrodnek>And so something like keyboard bindings is something I honestly would never take the time

00:34:53.960 --> 00:34:57.680
<v Larry Ogrodnek>to add to all that before because it seems like such an undertaking, even though like

00:34:57.680 --> 00:34:58.740
<v Larry Ogrodnek>you could say like, oh, it's simple.

00:34:58.760 --> 00:35:01.340
<v Larry Ogrodnek>You just add like event handlers to all your things and blah, blah, blah.

00:35:01.560 --> 00:35:05.800
<v Larry Ogrodnek>But yeah, it was just like slightly out of like adding to like an example project.

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:06.040
<v Larry Ogrodnek>Right.

00:35:06.140 --> 00:35:08.060
<v Larry Ogrodnek>But now it's it's because it's built into the framework.

00:35:08.140 --> 00:35:11.500
<v Larry Ogrodnek>It's super easy and it gets treated the same as any other event.

00:35:11.560 --> 00:35:15.880
<v Larry Ogrodnek>Right. So like pressing a key up or key down to an event, just like, you know, clicking the button.

00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:20.580
<v Larry Ogrodnek>And so it's one of those. It's a simple example, but it's, you know.

00:35:21.180 --> 00:35:25.620
<v Michael Kennedy>Yeah. So let me describe it for listeners. So you've got this progress bar looking thing.

00:35:25.820 --> 00:35:29.120
<v Michael Kennedy>That's the volume control, like, you know, your standard macOS looking thing.

00:35:30.580 --> 00:35:37.140
<v Michael Kennedy>And it's got a mute button, a max volume, an up and down button. And these are like buttons that,

00:35:37.740 --> 00:35:38.600
<v Michael Kennedy>you might be used to.

00:35:38.650 --> 00:35:41.580
<v Michael Kennedy>But also, you can just use the arrow keys,

00:35:41.670 --> 00:35:43.080
<v Michael Kennedy>and it's just as if you're clicking the button.

00:35:43.150 --> 00:35:45.460
<v Michael Kennedy>And it all updates, even with probably one

00:35:45.470 --> 00:35:48.280
<v Michael Kennedy>of those CSS transitions to make it feel a little animated.

00:35:48.750 --> 00:35:49.940
<v Michael Kennedy>So you jump in.

00:35:50.240 --> 00:35:50.340
<v Michael Kennedy>Yeah.

00:35:51.500 --> 00:35:51.980
<v Michael Kennedy>Looks really nice.

00:35:53.599 --> 00:35:54.880
<v Michael Kennedy>So what about the source?

00:35:57.039 --> 00:35:59.380
<v Michael Kennedy>I think there's a couple of interesting things here.

00:35:59.430 --> 00:36:02.840
<v Michael Kennedy>First of all, the volume.html--

00:36:03.130 --> 00:36:04.040
<v Michael Kennedy>this looks Tailwind.

00:36:04.110 --> 00:36:04.560
<v Michael Kennedy>Is that right?

00:36:04.960 --> 00:36:06.220
<v Larry Ogrodnek>Yeah, this is using Tailwind.

00:36:06.500 --> 00:36:06.560
<v Larry Ogrodnek>Yeah.

00:36:07.520 --> 00:36:08.760
<v Larry Ogrodnek>- Yeah, I, yeah.

00:36:09.880 --> 00:36:11.300
<v Larry Ogrodnek>It's interesting, I feel like it's one of those things

00:36:11.340 --> 00:36:13.720
<v Larry Ogrodnek>where when I first, my first pass of this examples website

00:36:13.920 --> 00:36:16.660
<v Larry Ogrodnek>used almost no HTML CSS and was like super ugly,

00:36:16.860 --> 00:36:18.940
<v Larry Ogrodnek>but I kinda wanted to focus to be on like,

00:36:19.280 --> 00:36:21.620
<v Larry Ogrodnek>what is the, like what is like the really,

00:36:21.680 --> 00:36:24.060
<v Larry Ogrodnek>what are you really writing versus like what is, you know?

00:36:24.880 --> 00:36:27.180
<v Larry Ogrodnek>But I kinda gave in and used Talens

00:36:27.280 --> 00:36:30.240
<v Larry Ogrodnek>because it looks a lot nicer and looks more professional,

00:36:30.500 --> 00:36:31.720
<v Michael Kennedy>something people would wanna pick up, right?

00:36:32.340 --> 00:36:33.520
<v Michael Kennedy>- Yeah, I think there's a,

00:36:34.660 --> 00:36:37.640
<v Michael Kennedy>This gets lost sometimes in different projects,

00:36:37.920 --> 00:36:40.460
<v Michael Kennedy>because I look at a lot of people send me projects all the time.

00:36:40.500 --> 00:36:42.240
<v Michael Kennedy>And like, hey, do you think this is what we're talking about

00:36:42.300 --> 00:36:44.660
<v Michael Kennedy>in various venues or whatever?

00:36:46.660 --> 00:36:50.480
<v Michael Kennedy>Having something that looks like, oh, I wish my app looked like that

00:36:50.540 --> 00:36:54.020
<v Michael Kennedy>or it did like that is highly inspiring.

00:36:55.760 --> 00:36:58.700
<v Michael Kennedy>If you had like, hey, look, we have all of our live demos,

00:36:59.080 --> 00:37:03.380
<v Michael Kennedy>and they're exactly like 1993 web view appearance.

00:37:03.840 --> 00:37:05.520
<v Michael Kennedy>But see how easy the program is?

00:37:05.520 --> 00:37:06.800
<v Michael Kennedy>You're like, OK.

00:37:07.880 --> 00:37:12.820
<v Michael Kennedy>I know if you look at this source, it's full of P8

00:37:12.940 --> 00:37:15.640
<v Michael Kennedy>for padding 8 and such and such.

00:37:16.200 --> 00:37:16.660
<v Michael Kennedy>It's worth it.

00:37:17.480 --> 00:37:18.320
<v Michael Kennedy>It's so worth it.

00:37:18.840 --> 00:37:24.320
<v Michael Kennedy>And the HTML is just pure HTML, except for you

00:37:24.500 --> 00:37:29.080
<v Michael Kennedy>have these sort of attribute-driven things, right?

00:37:29.380 --> 00:37:30.160
<v Michael Kennedy>Right, exactly.

00:37:30.420 --> 00:37:33.020
<v Michael Kennedy>Maybe talk about how is the HTML different then?

00:37:33.780 --> 00:37:34.680
<v Larry Ogrodnek>That's exactly it, yeah.

00:37:34.750 --> 00:37:38.680
<v Larry Ogrodnek>So for this example, the difference is, right, for a button,

00:37:39.680 --> 00:37:44.980
<v Larry Ogrodnek>we have this phx click attribute, which

00:37:45.819 --> 00:37:46.940
<v Larry Ogrodnek>is what tells--

00:37:47.420 --> 00:37:49.520
<v Larry Ogrodnek>wires up with Phoenix Live View that when someone clicks on this,

00:37:49.780 --> 00:37:50.640
<v Larry Ogrodnek>we should send this event call.

00:37:50.760 --> 00:37:52.480
<v Larry Ogrodnek>So the first one says phx click equals down.

00:37:53.350 --> 00:37:54.380
<v Larry Ogrodnek>And so when someone clicks on that button,

00:37:54.590 --> 00:37:58.680
<v Larry Ogrodnek>we send an event to the server that just says click down.

00:37:59.430 --> 00:38:02.320
<v Larry Ogrodnek>And there's also this phx window key down,

00:38:03.160 --> 00:38:04.420
<v Larry Ogrodnek>and PHX key.

00:38:05.260 --> 00:38:10.540
<v Larry Ogrodnek>So basically, we're sending a key update for this arrow down

00:38:10.730 --> 00:38:11.940
<v Larry Ogrodnek>is one of the keys.

00:38:12.090 --> 00:38:15.300
<v Larry Ogrodnek>And so these parts are not something that I--

00:38:15.410 --> 00:38:17.360
<v Larry Ogrodnek>again, this is just the straight Phoenix--

00:38:17.460 --> 00:38:20.220
<v Larry Ogrodnek>if you were an Elixir app, it would work exactly the same way.

00:38:20.380 --> 00:38:22.560
<v Larry Ogrodnek>You could take this HTML and run it on Elixir app.

00:38:22.650 --> 00:38:24.440
<v Larry Ogrodnek>And if you had the Elixir back end,

00:38:25.420 --> 00:38:26.840
<v Larry Ogrodnek>it would work exactly the same way.

00:38:26.850 --> 00:38:29.020
<v Larry Ogrodnek>So that side looks exactly the same.

00:38:29.820 --> 00:38:32.460
<v Michael Kennedy>- Yeah, I mean, what's the value in renaming that to PYW?

00:38:34.119 --> 00:38:34.880
<v Michael Kennedy>- Yeah, I know.

00:38:35.100 --> 00:38:36.820
<v Michael Kennedy>And actually, I think you could.

00:38:36.860 --> 00:38:37.840
<v Larry Ogrodnek>I think they do have it,

00:38:39.180 --> 00:38:41.740
<v Larry Ogrodnek>they do have it like configurable with the client JavaScript

00:38:41.960 --> 00:38:43.400
<v Larry Ogrodnek>where you can like do a different specifier

00:38:43.440 --> 00:38:45.580
<v Larry Ogrodnek>if you wanted to, but it's kind of nice this way.

00:38:45.700 --> 00:38:46.700
<v Larry Ogrodnek>I mean, I think the other thing is too,

00:38:46.820 --> 00:38:49.200
<v Larry Ogrodnek>like in the age of LLMs, and just even examples,

00:38:49.600 --> 00:38:51.120
<v Larry Ogrodnek>like there, at this point,

00:38:51.300 --> 00:38:52.820
<v Larry Ogrodnek>there's a ton more Phoenix LiveView code

00:38:52.920 --> 00:38:54.580
<v Larry Ogrodnek>than there is PyView code.

00:38:54.600 --> 00:38:55.940
<v Larry Ogrodnek>And so if you find a good LiveView example,

00:38:56.300 --> 00:38:58.700
<v Larry Ogrodnek>it's like you can get it to work in PyView, hopefully.

00:38:59.680 --> 00:39:00.100
<v Michael Kennedy>Yeah, that's interesting.

00:39:00.230 --> 00:39:02.920
<v Michael Kennedy>So in a sense, the front end stuff

00:39:03.430 --> 00:39:07.420
<v Michael Kennedy>is API compatible with both back ends, maybe.

00:39:08.040 --> 00:39:08.380
<v Michael Kennedy>Is that it?

00:39:08.600 --> 00:39:09.420
<v Larry Ogrodnek>Yeah, sort of.

00:39:09.680 --> 00:39:13.200
<v Larry Ogrodnek>I mean, like, yeah, and like conceptually,

00:39:13.680 --> 00:39:17.460
<v Larry Ogrodnek>I mean, I think that the thing is the Phoenix Live View

00:39:17.730 --> 00:39:18.840
<v Larry Ogrodnek>has a different templating language.

00:39:20.540 --> 00:39:24.100
<v Larry Ogrodnek>So things like loops or conditionals

00:39:24.420 --> 00:39:25.720
<v Larry Ogrodnek>look totally different, right?

00:39:25.980 --> 00:39:27.560
<v Michael Kennedy>So you might be able to pull up an example and go,

00:39:27.580 --> 00:39:29.119
<v Michael Kennedy>I see how I'll do it here, but it's

00:39:29.120 --> 00:39:29.560
<v Michael Kennedy>Not identical.

00:39:30.020 --> 00:39:30.500
<v Larry Ogrodnek>Right, exactly.

00:39:30.770 --> 00:39:31.800
<v Larry Ogrodnek>Or if you see something, an example,

00:39:31.880 --> 00:39:33.160
<v Larry Ogrodnek>where it's just like, oh, I'm trying to do a form,

00:39:33.380 --> 00:39:36.700
<v Larry Ogrodnek>but my PHX update isn't firing, it's

00:39:36.700 --> 00:39:38.960
<v Larry Ogrodnek>like it's probably the same solution in both places.

00:39:39.420 --> 00:39:39.780
<v Michael Kennedy>Got it.

00:39:39.920 --> 00:39:40.220
<v Michael Kennedy>Got it.

00:39:40.240 --> 00:39:40.460
<v Michael Kennedy>Got it.

00:39:41.939 --> 00:39:46.980
<v Michael Kennedy>So then you've got the HTML side, which is pretty interesting.

00:39:48.360 --> 00:39:50.840
<v Michael Kennedy>Tell us about how this, what do we write over here?

00:39:52.220 --> 00:39:52.500
<v Michael Kennedy>Yeah.

00:39:53.480 --> 00:39:55.080
<v Michael Kennedy>The data exchange looks like, sorry,

00:39:55.290 --> 00:39:57.340
<v Michael Kennedy>the data exchange looks like you're exchanging data classes,

00:39:57.660 --> 00:40:00.780
<v Michael Kennedy>like the DTO sort of API aspect?

00:40:01.579 --> 00:40:02.280
<v Larry Ogrodnek>Yeah, exactly.

00:40:02.470 --> 00:40:08.900
<v Larry Ogrodnek>So, well, you can, yeah, so each live view, like, page is basically, like,

00:40:09.310 --> 00:40:13.320
<v Larry Ogrodnek>you would type it to a specific, you know, I call it a context,

00:40:13.510 --> 00:40:15.440
<v Larry Ogrodnek>like, which is, like, what, basically what's going into your template.

00:40:16.080 --> 00:40:19.640
<v Larry Ogrodnek>And so you can do, I mean, it doesn't have to be, I like using data classes.

00:40:20.190 --> 00:40:20.980
<v Larry Ogrodnek>It can be a data class.

00:40:21.110 --> 00:40:23.220
<v Larry Ogrodnek>It can be a type dict.

00:40:23.380 --> 00:40:24.800
<v Larry Ogrodnek>It could be a Pydantic class.

00:40:25.760 --> 00:40:27.140
<v Larry Ogrodnek>It could probably just be a regular dict.

00:40:27.360 --> 00:40:29.260
<v Larry Ogrodnek>I don't know that I've ever tried that, but I think that should work.

00:40:29.670 --> 00:40:32.040
<v Larry Ogrodnek>But it's just really just for the typing, you know?

00:40:33.300 --> 00:40:34.840
<v Larry Ogrodnek>And it's what we'll get past here in template.

00:40:35.030 --> 00:40:38.380
<v Larry Ogrodnek>And then, you know, so maybe it's worth talking through,

00:40:38.470 --> 00:40:40.840
<v Larry Ogrodnek>like there are, there's these sort of different lifecycle components.

00:40:41.390 --> 00:40:45.280
<v Larry Ogrodnek>And so like with your view, there's like,

00:40:45.570 --> 00:40:47.880
<v Larry Ogrodnek>the first thing that gets called is there's this mount command.

00:40:48.730 --> 00:40:52.440
<v Larry Ogrodnek>And that gets called any time, I mean, when your view gets instantiated.

00:40:52.510 --> 00:40:53.800
<v Larry Ogrodnek>So when someone visits the page,

00:40:55.140 --> 00:40:56.940
<v Larry Ogrodnek>we're going to create an instance of your class,

00:40:57.500 --> 00:40:59.580
<v Larry Ogrodnek>your LiveView class, and mount will get called

00:41:00.720 --> 00:41:02.580
<v Larry Ogrodnek>with the socket, which is, I mean,

00:41:02.680 --> 00:41:03.740
<v Larry Ogrodnek>probably going to be more detailed than that,

00:41:03.760 --> 00:41:05.000
<v Larry Ogrodnek>but that's kind of like your interface

00:41:05.440 --> 00:41:06.000
<v Larry Ogrodnek>to the communication.

00:41:07.100 --> 00:41:09.600
<v Larry Ogrodnek>It's not the web socket necessarily.

00:41:09.860 --> 00:41:14.060
<v Larry Ogrodnek>It's more like how you interoperate with the system.

00:41:14.820 --> 00:41:15.560
<v Larry Ogrodnek>And then also the session.

00:41:15.820 --> 00:41:19.320
<v Larry Ogrodnek>So if you want to copy stuff over from the HTTP session,

00:41:19.760 --> 00:41:21.480
<v Larry Ogrodnek>like user information or whatever,

00:41:21.580 --> 00:41:24.640
<v Larry Ogrodnek>you can copy that over in the mount to your data.

00:41:25.180 --> 00:41:28.760
<v Larry Ogrodnek>Then after that, and it actually gets called--

00:41:29.700 --> 00:41:30.680
<v Larry Ogrodnek>well, I'll talk about that later.

00:41:31.530 --> 00:41:34.300
<v Larry Ogrodnek>But then after that, there's an optional-- it's not shown in this example,

00:41:34.540 --> 00:41:37.860
<v Larry Ogrodnek>but there's an optional handle params change,

00:41:38.190 --> 00:41:42.080
<v Larry Ogrodnek>which gets called with path parameters or URL parameters.

00:41:42.600 --> 00:41:45.760
<v Larry Ogrodnek>And the reason that's separate is because your class might get just instantiated once

00:41:46.800 --> 00:41:47.900
<v Larry Ogrodnek>when the page is viewed.

00:41:48.600 --> 00:41:52.760
<v Larry Ogrodnek>But you might have programmatic navigation that's not real navigation,

00:41:52.920 --> 00:41:59.000
<v Larry Ogrodnek>It's like JavaScript navigation where maybe for things like filter options or pagination options,

00:41:59.570 --> 00:42:02.700
<v Larry Ogrodnek>you want to put those in the URL so that it's kind of bookmarkable and shareable.

00:42:03.400 --> 00:42:04.840
<v Larry Ogrodnek>You don't want to do a full page reload.

00:42:05.570 --> 00:42:09.920
<v Larry Ogrodnek>And so anytime those get changed, including on the initial page load, we'll call a handle params method.

00:42:10.030 --> 00:42:11.900
<v Larry Ogrodnek>And you don't have to implement that if you don't care about it.

00:42:14.859 --> 00:42:18.580
<v Michael Kennedy>In this case, a volume is the volume. It doesn't matter where the volume is.

00:42:18.700 --> 00:42:18.760
<v Michael Kennedy>Exactly.

00:42:19.160 --> 00:42:22.240
<v Larry Ogrodnek>Yeah, but you might want to be able to bookmark, like, this is a good volume or whatever.

00:42:22.840 --> 00:42:25.980
<v Larry Ogrodnek>And I think the counting example does have that just to kind of show how it would work.

00:42:27.040 --> 00:42:27.320
<v Michael Kennedy>I see.

00:42:27.360 --> 00:42:31.040
<v Michael Kennedy>So in that sense, you get a bit of a deep linking into it.

00:42:31.440 --> 00:42:31.760
<v Larry Ogrodnek>Exactly.

00:42:31.980 --> 00:42:32.360
<v Michael Kennedy>That's cool.

00:42:32.380 --> 00:42:32.480
<v Michael Kennedy>Yeah.

00:42:32.660 --> 00:42:32.740
<v Michael Kennedy>Okay.

00:42:33.040 --> 00:42:33.180
<v Larry Ogrodnek>Yeah.

00:42:33.980 --> 00:42:34.060
<v Larry Ogrodnek>Yeah.

00:42:34.120 --> 00:42:39.200
<v Larry Ogrodnek>And again, it takes advantage of this kind of JavaScript navigation that you can initiate

00:42:39.340 --> 00:42:40.800
<v Larry Ogrodnek>from the front end or from the back end.

00:42:40.820 --> 00:42:46.180
<v Larry Ogrodnek>Like, on the front end, you can initiate a navigation transition that will basically tell

00:42:46.200 --> 00:42:50.560
<v Larry Ogrodnek>the backend, hey, change your prams to this, and the browser takes care of reading the prams and

00:42:50.760 --> 00:42:58.340
<v Larry Ogrodnek>changing the state. Or on the backend, you can also tell the frontend, oh, hey, because you did

00:42:58.480 --> 00:43:03.280
<v Larry Ogrodnek>this, I want you to change the URL to be blah, blah, blah, and here's what the new URL should be.

00:43:04.010 --> 00:43:08.740
<v Larry Ogrodnek>So you can do it both ways. And then the render method gets called. And it's not shown here,

00:43:08.820 --> 00:43:12.580
<v Larry Ogrodnek>because the kind of base class basically for the render method,

00:43:14.200 --> 00:43:18.460
<v Larry Ogrodnek>it looks for a template file called whatever.

00:43:18.840 --> 00:43:21.400
<v Larry Ogrodnek>This is volume.py, so it looks for volume.html,

00:43:22.080 --> 00:43:23.280
<v Larry Ogrodnek>and it uses that as your template.

00:43:24.060 --> 00:43:26.360
<v Larry Ogrodnek>It also will look to see if there's a volume.css,

00:43:26.600 --> 00:43:31.200
<v Larry Ogrodnek>and we'll just kind of inject that in as the CSS for this, if it exists.

00:43:31.670 --> 00:43:33.820
<v Larry Ogrodnek>But if you wanted to override render, you can,

00:43:33.870 --> 00:43:36.220
<v Larry Ogrodnek>and that's how the T-Street rendering works,

00:43:36.290 --> 00:43:37.940
<v Larry Ogrodnek>is you basically do provide a render method

00:43:38.380 --> 00:43:39.240
<v Larry Ogrodnek>that returns a T string.

00:43:41.520 --> 00:43:44.280
<v Larry Ogrodnek>So after all that is done, so that actually happens twice.

00:43:44.620 --> 00:43:46.300
<v Larry Ogrodnek>It happens once for the HTML render,

00:43:46.990 --> 00:43:49.140
<v Larry Ogrodnek>and then it happens again for the Live View render.

00:43:50.300 --> 00:43:52.120
<v Larry Ogrodnek>And those are handled separately, partially

00:43:52.170 --> 00:43:53.440
<v Larry Ogrodnek>because that's how Phoenix Live View does it,

00:43:53.660 --> 00:43:55.260
<v Larry Ogrodnek>but also because some things are different.

00:43:55.520 --> 00:43:58.980
<v Larry Ogrodnek>Like for the initial HTML render, some things are not available.

00:43:59.110 --> 00:44:01.460
<v Larry Ogrodnek>Like you can't do Pub/Sub stuff to subscribe to channels.

00:44:01.960 --> 00:44:04.500
<v Larry Ogrodnek>You can't do scheduling stuff.

00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:06.440
<v Larry Ogrodnek>It's a little bit more limited to what you can do.

00:44:08.180 --> 00:44:09.180
<v Larry Ogrodnek>But anyway, that's a separate step.

00:44:09.300 --> 00:44:12.220
<v Larry Ogrodnek>And then after render, if an event comes in,

00:44:12.360 --> 00:44:13.380
<v Larry Ogrodnek>this handle event gets called.

00:44:13.580 --> 00:44:16.120
<v Larry Ogrodnek>And what you're showing here for the volume control

00:44:18.019 --> 00:44:21.680
<v Larry Ogrodnek>is kind of like my V1 of the event method that basically just

00:44:21.860 --> 00:44:22.560
<v Larry Ogrodnek>takes an event.

00:44:22.730 --> 00:44:24.820
<v Larry Ogrodnek>So there's one method called handle event that takes the event

00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:27.940
<v Larry Ogrodnek>and the payload, which is a dict of the options.

00:44:28.680 --> 00:44:29.580
<v Larry Ogrodnek>Then you have the socket.

00:44:29.670 --> 00:44:31.560
<v Larry Ogrodnek>And so you can see here, it's just a bunch of if-else.

00:44:31.880 --> 00:44:37.060
<v Larry Ogrodnek>Like if the event is key update, then just take the key as the event name.

00:44:37.140 --> 00:44:44.100
<v Larry Ogrodnek>If it's on or off, change the, if it's off or they hit the left arrow, then set the volume to zero.

00:44:44.380 --> 00:44:46.520
<v Larry Ogrodnek>If it's on or they hit the right arrow, set the volume to 100.

00:44:48.660 --> 00:44:52.040
<v Larry Ogrodnek>And then there's some stuff that just kind of bound the volume at the end.

00:44:52.760 --> 00:44:57.380
<v Larry Ogrodnek>And so that's all you do is you kind of basically, this handle event method gets called.

00:44:57.800 --> 00:44:58.540
<v Larry Ogrodnek>You're updating your state.

00:44:58.840 --> 00:45:01.120
<v Larry Ogrodnek>And then after this gets called, automatically,

00:45:01.120 --> 00:45:02.200
<v Larry Ogrodnek>your render method gets called again.

00:45:04.960 --> 00:45:07.380
<v Larry Ogrodnek>And basically, you're just re-rendering with the new state.

00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:10.680
<v Larry Ogrodnek>And then again, on the back end, we're figuring out,

00:45:10.710 --> 00:45:12.680
<v Larry Ogrodnek>like, OK, last time you rendered this tree,

00:45:13.060 --> 00:45:14.060
<v Larry Ogrodnek>now you're rendering this tree.

00:45:14.770 --> 00:45:15.440
<v Larry Ogrodnek>What changed?

00:45:15.640 --> 00:45:17.000
<v Larry Ogrodnek>I'm just going to send what changed.

00:45:17.490 --> 00:45:25.800
<v Michael Kennedy>It looks very, I don't know, view or data binding-like in here.

00:45:25.940 --> 00:45:30.840
<v Michael Kennedy>So when things start up, you say the context of this thing

00:45:31.020 --> 00:45:33.400
<v Michael Kennedy>is an instance of the volume class.

00:45:33.710 --> 00:45:35.440
<v Michael Kennedy>And then all you write in your code

00:45:35.450 --> 00:45:41.060
<v Michael Kennedy>is like socket.context.volume equals the various--

00:45:41.700 --> 00:45:44.440
<v Michael Kennedy>plus equals 10, minus equals 10, or equals 0.

00:45:44.860 --> 00:45:50.120
<v Michael Kennedy>And somehow, PyView says, OK, I've

00:45:50.280 --> 00:45:55.900
<v Michael Kennedy>wrapped this thing in some kind of responsive or something

00:45:55.940 --> 00:45:57.420
<v Michael Kennedy>that detects the changes, right, somehow?

00:45:58.280 --> 00:45:58.580
<v Larry Ogrodnek>Right.

00:45:58.830 --> 00:46:00.000
<v Larry Ogrodnek>Well, yeah, actually, yeah, I mean,

00:46:00.050 --> 00:46:01.200
<v Larry Ogrodnek>we're not even that smart right now.

00:46:01.250 --> 00:46:03.220
<v Larry Ogrodnek>I mean, we could be-- and I think ThingsLiveView

00:46:03.270 --> 00:46:06.640
<v Larry Ogrodnek>is a little smarter about it, where they do wrap and kind

00:46:06.640 --> 00:46:09.760
<v Larry Ogrodnek>of see if they-- but for this, basically, we just always render.

00:46:10.539 --> 00:46:11.020
<v Larry Ogrodnek>I see.

00:46:11.410 --> 00:46:13.040
<v Michael Kennedy>So you re-render the page and just go,

00:46:13.120 --> 00:46:14.620
<v Michael Kennedy>what is actually different about--

00:46:14.820 --> 00:46:15.020
<v Michael Kennedy>Exactly.

00:46:15.020 --> 00:46:15.380
<v Michael Kennedy>Oh, I see.

00:46:15.760 --> 00:46:18.160
<v Michael Kennedy>When I re-rendered with new data, then the volume value

00:46:18.440 --> 00:46:18.600
<v Michael Kennedy>changes.

00:46:18.700 --> 00:46:18.900
<v Michael Kennedy>Exactly.

00:46:19.370 --> 00:46:21.100
<v Larry Ogrodnek>But it is really nice, because like you're saying,

00:46:21.160 --> 00:46:22.799
<v Larry Ogrodnek>it's like you don't really--

00:46:22.800 --> 00:46:27.180
<v Larry Ogrodnek>your application logic becomes really simple because it's really just,

00:46:27.450 --> 00:46:30.940
<v Larry Ogrodnek>yeah, I update my state and then I know how to render my state object.

00:46:31.520 --> 00:46:33.920
<v Larry Ogrodnek>And I don't really care about whatever.

00:46:34.170 --> 00:46:40.100
<v Larry Ogrodnek>And even this handle event method, it's not really, I mean, I don't know.

00:46:40.220 --> 00:46:43.860
<v Larry Ogrodnek>It feels like it'd be a little bit of a stretch to call it stateless because you're rotating state.

00:46:44.340 --> 00:46:48.100
<v Larry Ogrodnek>But at the same time, you don't really care where this state object came from.

00:46:48.260 --> 00:46:50.560
<v Larry Ogrodnek>It's like, given this event, how would I transform this state?

00:46:51.560 --> 00:47:02.300
<v Michael Kennedy>Yeah, it's got a very strong view.js feel like I just changed the properties of the thing and something makes it happen that it goes back to everywhere this value is used, it changes.

00:47:02.820 --> 00:47:12.080
<v Larry Ogrodnek>Exactly. And that's really how it works. I mean, that's the kind of cool thing, you know, where we're talking about HTMX, where, you know, you have to be really intentional about like, OK, like how do I want to segment, you know, what I'm changing?

00:47:12.340 --> 00:47:15.880
<v Larry Ogrodnek>And, you know, when I do this, I know I want to change this part of the render, this part of the render.

00:47:16.020 --> 00:47:17.820
<v Larry Ogrodnek>And with this, you don't really have to think about it, right?

00:47:17.980 --> 00:47:19.740
<v Larry Ogrodnek>Like, you just change what you want to change,

00:47:20.080 --> 00:47:22.500
<v Larry Ogrodnek>and the part of the template that needs to change will naturally change

00:47:23.470 --> 00:47:26.460
<v Larry Ogrodnek>because we're treating it as, like, this diff operation, you know?

00:47:26.940 --> 00:47:28.040
<v Michael Kennedy>Yeah, yeah, cool.

00:47:28.420 --> 00:47:31.720
<v Michael Kennedy>Let's do one more example, something that kind of shows off what's possible.

00:47:32.140 --> 00:47:32.500
<v Larry Ogrodnek>Okay.

00:47:33.699 --> 00:47:36.200
<v Larry Ogrodnek>Well, gosh, there's two things I'd want to show.

00:47:36.960 --> 00:47:39.400
<v Larry Ogrodnek>But, like, we could do, like, the Maps thing,

00:47:39.590 --> 00:47:42.680
<v Larry Ogrodnek>which is just, like, a way how to integrate with JavaScript

00:47:43.100 --> 00:47:45.940
<v Larry Ogrodnek>and then also maybe, like, one of the newer things

00:47:45.960 --> 00:47:48.340
<v Larry Ogrodnek>like the T Street version of the counter.

00:47:49.280 --> 00:47:49.420
<v Larry Ogrodnek>Okay.

00:47:49.980 --> 00:47:51.440
<v Larry Ogrodnek>Yeah, so we'd look at the Maps one.

00:47:51.880 --> 00:47:52.760
<v Larry Ogrodnek>And so this is like very simple,

00:47:53.040 --> 00:47:55.800
<v Larry Ogrodnek>but this is the thing that like, you know,

00:47:57.780 --> 00:47:59.280
<v Larry Ogrodnek>I think, you know, the thing with like frames

00:47:59.380 --> 00:48:01.440
<v Larry Ogrodnek>with PyView and other frameworks is like,

00:48:01.490 --> 00:48:04.560
<v Larry Ogrodnek>I think maybe people try to bucket into like,

00:48:04.700 --> 00:48:06.620
<v Larry Ogrodnek>oh, you like, you know, hate JavaScript or whatever.

00:48:06.810 --> 00:48:07.980
<v Larry Ogrodnek>And like, no, I don't hate JavaScript.

00:48:08.620 --> 00:48:10.100
<v Larry Ogrodnek>JavaScript is great at doing JavaScript things.

00:48:10.880 --> 00:48:13.120
<v Larry Ogrodnek>And you do need to like integrate with JavaScript

00:48:13.210 --> 00:48:13.920
<v Larry Ogrodnek>a lot of the times.

00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:18.860
<v Larry Ogrodnek>And there's a lot of really great, rich, interactive JavaScript things that wouldn't really make sense to do in the server.

00:48:19.140 --> 00:48:32.180
<v Larry Ogrodnek>So this is an example of a Maps thing using Leaflet.js, which is like a JavaScript library that uses OpenStreet map data for doing like a Google Maps kind of style Maps view with tiles and stuff like that.

00:48:33.140 --> 00:48:37.840
<v Larry Ogrodnek>And so this example just kind of shows like, you know, the events.

00:48:38.360 --> 00:48:43.560
<v Larry Ogrodnek>You know, basically there's this hooks system is what they call it on the Phoenix Live View side and call it the same thing.

00:48:44.340 --> 00:48:54.100
<v Larry Ogrodnek>But basically, it's a way to kind of like, you know, we saw things like, you know, PHX key, you know, click, you know, blah, blah, blah is kind of built in event system.

00:48:54.220 --> 00:49:03.980
<v Larry Ogrodnek>So running JavaScript hooks is a way to kind of let you integrate custom JavaScript and have access to that same event system.

00:49:04.080 --> 00:49:12.240
<v Larry Ogrodnek>So for this, there is a JavaScript component, which is kind of like a wrapper over, not really a wrapper, but a wrapper over some JavaScript stuff that handles this.

00:49:12.920 --> 00:49:14.640
<v Larry Ogrodnek>And so we have events going two ways.

00:49:14.790 --> 00:49:21.420
<v Larry Ogrodnek>And so when you click on one of the things in the sidebar,

00:49:21.600 --> 00:49:22.960
<v Larry Ogrodnek>it sends something to the back end saying,

00:49:23.390 --> 00:49:25.760
<v Larry Ogrodnek>oh, update your state to say you have

00:49:25.840 --> 00:49:26.780
<v Larry Ogrodnek>this national park selected.

00:49:27.330 --> 00:49:30.240
<v Larry Ogrodnek>And then the back end also sends a--

00:49:31.799 --> 00:49:33.120
<v Larry Ogrodnek>I'm getting mixed up with this.

00:49:33.120 --> 00:49:34.020
<v Larry Ogrodnek>I think when you click on the marker,

00:49:34.260 --> 00:49:36.080
<v Larry Ogrodnek>that's where the JavaScript sends the event to the back end.

00:49:36.300 --> 00:49:36.620
<v Larry Ogrodnek>Yeah, yeah.

00:49:37.820 --> 00:49:38.580
<v Michael Kennedy>Larry, this is cool.

00:49:38.900 --> 00:49:41.280
<v Michael Kennedy>If I click-- so let me describe it for people.

00:49:41.760 --> 00:49:44.740
<v Michael Kennedy>So we've got on one side a map of the United States,

00:49:45.160 --> 00:49:49.220
<v Michael Kennedy>and on the left a nice list of the different national parks,

00:49:49.300 --> 00:49:49.920
<v Michael Kennedy>the famous ones.

00:49:52.120 --> 00:49:54.820
<v Michael Kennedy>If I go entirely into this JavaScript thing

00:49:54.960 --> 00:49:59.040
<v Michael Kennedy>and I click on something in the map, one of the points

00:49:59.080 --> 00:50:00.300
<v Michael Kennedy>of interest, which is one of these parks,

00:50:01.060 --> 00:50:04.540
<v Michael Kennedy>it communicates back to PyView and is selecting it

00:50:06.240 --> 00:50:07.980
<v Michael Kennedy>in the list, the Python bit.

00:50:08.580 --> 00:50:10.200
<v Michael Kennedy>But then again, if I click in the Python bit,

00:50:10.300 --> 00:50:13.200
<v Michael Kennedy>like Glacier National Park or one near me,

00:50:13.360 --> 00:50:14.580
<v Michael Kennedy>the Olympic National Park, right?

00:50:14.800 --> 00:50:17.980
<v Michael Kennedy>Then it will then drive the JavaScript.

00:50:18.320 --> 00:50:20.460
<v Michael Kennedy>So this is the bi-directional thing you're talking about.

00:50:20.520 --> 00:50:21.120
<v Michael Kennedy>This is very cool.

00:50:21.420 --> 00:50:22.360
<v Larry Ogrodnek>- Right, exactly, yeah.

00:50:22.570 --> 00:50:24.480
<v Larry Ogrodnek>So the JavaScript part has access to

00:50:24.490 --> 00:50:26.440
<v Larry Ogrodnek>like a similar component system where it's just like,

00:50:26.520 --> 00:50:28.520
<v Larry Ogrodnek>oh, if I get this event, I think I call it like highlight park.

00:50:29.220 --> 00:50:30.680
<v Larry Ogrodnek>Then I know that like, oh, I need to like,

00:50:31.090 --> 00:50:32.980
<v Larry Ogrodnek>you know, turn this marker on.

00:50:33.800 --> 00:50:35.780
<v Larry Ogrodnek>And going the other way, the JavaScript has like,

00:50:35.990 --> 00:50:37.780
<v Larry Ogrodnek>in its own handling like, oh, when this happens,

00:50:38.060 --> 00:50:40.480
<v Larry Ogrodnek>and I should call this method on the LiveView.

00:50:40.480 --> 00:50:44.640
<v Larry Ogrodnek>And so your LiveView side, like your Python side,

00:50:45.320 --> 00:50:47.620
<v Larry Ogrodnek>stays the same where it's still doing event handling

00:50:48.800 --> 00:50:51.280
<v Larry Ogrodnek>and also sending events if needed to the front end.

00:50:51.310 --> 00:50:52.880
<v Larry Ogrodnek>But you can get access to like--

00:50:52.930 --> 00:50:57.480
<v Larry Ogrodnek>so maps, drag and drop stuff is a big one,

00:50:57.630 --> 00:50:58.660
<v Larry Ogrodnek>even like really rich editors.

00:50:58.890 --> 00:51:02.780
<v Larry Ogrodnek>Like I've done something with using like CodeMirror,

00:51:02.880 --> 00:51:08.380
<v Larry Ogrodnek>which is a really nice IDE kind of editing experience

00:51:08.470 --> 00:51:08.940
<v Larry Ogrodnek>in the browser.

00:51:09.710 --> 00:51:10.500
<v Larry Ogrodnek>And so you can still--

00:51:10.670 --> 00:51:12.920
<v Larry Ogrodnek>I think the thing with PyView, right, is it's not--

00:51:13.210 --> 00:51:15.840
<v Larry Ogrodnek>I don't know, for me anyway, it's not about technology-focused.

00:51:16.100 --> 00:51:16.900
<v Larry Ogrodnek>I only want to use Python.

00:51:17.120 --> 00:51:21.460
<v Larry Ogrodnek>I want to have great web experiences, whatever that takes,

00:51:21.760 --> 00:51:24.680
<v Larry Ogrodnek>but in a simple way that I can understand and debug

00:51:25.840 --> 00:51:26.860
<v Larry Ogrodnek>and test, right?

00:51:27.120 --> 00:51:27.520
<v Larry Ogrodnek>So yeah.

00:51:28.340 --> 00:51:31.860
<v Michael Kennedy>Yeah, this is a very impressive app, I think.

00:51:32.200 --> 00:51:36.160
<v Michael Kennedy>Yeah, I mean, I look at it as like, wow, that would be kind of a big project to build.

00:51:36.360 --> 00:51:39.460
<v Michael Kennedy>And my feeling is it wasn't that big of a deal with PyPy.

00:51:39.520 --> 00:51:42.000
<v Larry Ogrodnek>No, it's very, yeah, that's kind of part of the fun thing with PyPy.

00:51:42.060 --> 00:51:44.760
<v Larry Ogrodnek>Like making these little examples is like super fun and also like pretty easy.

00:51:45.560 --> 00:51:48.240
<v Larry Ogrodnek>Yeah, so a similar one, there's like that Kanban board one, just to quickly talk.

00:51:48.420 --> 00:51:50.860
<v Larry Ogrodnek>It's a similar thing with drag and drop, but the same kind of concept.

00:51:51.780 --> 00:51:55.260
<v Michael Kennedy>I want to throw out maybe like just thinking back to that map one real quick before we move on.

00:51:56.020 --> 00:52:00.840
<v Michael Kennedy>It feels like this would actually be quite relevant for data scientists as well, right?

00:52:00.940 --> 00:52:08.540
<v Michael Kennedy>Like, I don't think you build it as data science, but there's a lot of like, oh, we need to build a dashboard that updates based on whatever.

00:52:08.780 --> 00:52:10.140
<v Michael Kennedy>And we need these different visualizations.

00:52:10.420 --> 00:52:14.840
<v Michael Kennedy>And with the JavaScript integration, I feel like you probably could do some pretty cool stuff.

00:52:15.140 --> 00:52:16.260
<v Larry Ogrodnek>Yeah, no, for sure.

00:52:16.520 --> 00:52:17.040
<v Larry Ogrodnek>Yeah, for sure.

00:52:17.060 --> 00:52:22.340
<v Larry Ogrodnek>And I've done, and I think there are a lot of really great JavaScript, like, graphing libraries.

00:52:22.520 --> 00:52:30.700
<v Larry Ogrodnek>Like, one that I've used before is something that I learned about just from figuring out that it's what, like, Google Notebook, like, Google Cloud, you know, their, like, Jupyter Notebooks thing uses.

00:52:30.840 --> 00:52:31.980
<v Larry Ogrodnek>called Altair.

00:52:32.580 --> 00:52:33.620
<v Larry Ogrodnek>And that's something which is cool

00:52:33.650 --> 00:52:35.200
<v Larry Ogrodnek>because there's basically a Python backend

00:52:35.310 --> 00:52:36.440
<v Larry Ogrodnek>for generating the graph data.

00:52:36.990 --> 00:52:39.080
<v Larry Ogrodnek>But then the front end is this JavaScript thing.

00:52:39.130 --> 00:52:40.920
<v Larry Ogrodnek>And so I don't think I...

00:52:41.260 --> 00:52:42.200
<v Larry Ogrodnek>I should put an example of that,

00:52:42.270 --> 00:52:43.420
<v Larry Ogrodnek>but I've used it at work

00:52:43.600 --> 00:52:46.440
<v Larry Ogrodnek>where we just have a very simple graph hook

00:52:47.320 --> 00:52:48.440
<v Larry Ogrodnek>that wraps the Altair library

00:52:48.970 --> 00:52:51.200
<v Larry Ogrodnek>and the backend generates the graph in Python code.

00:52:52.099 --> 00:52:54.300
<v Larry Ogrodnek>And it's just super easy to display and things like that.

00:52:54.330 --> 00:52:55.340
<v Larry Ogrodnek>And to your point, Michael,

00:52:55.530 --> 00:52:56.620
<v Larry Ogrodnek>one of the really cool things with PyView

00:52:56.630 --> 00:52:59.040
<v Larry Ogrodnek>is because everything is over WebSockets,

00:52:59.960 --> 00:53:08.800
<v Larry Ogrodnek>Any server push stuff, like if data comes in or data changes, it's really no work to tell the browser to update to the new state.

00:53:08.940 --> 00:53:12.160
<v Larry Ogrodnek>It's super, super easy to do, which is cool.

00:53:12.740 --> 00:53:13.160
<v Larry Ogrodnek>That's awesome.

00:53:13.820 --> 00:53:19.960
<v Larry Ogrodnek>Yeah, so the one other thing I wanted to touch on quickly is just because I think the first example we looked at the volume was kind of using the older event.

00:53:19.960 --> 00:53:26.240
<v Larry Ogrodnek>So if you look at maybe the basic counter T-string version, like the source for that, I mean, it's the same kind of counter example.

00:53:26.460 --> 00:53:29.340
<v Larry Ogrodnek>But the source is like, I think there's a count t-string

00:53:29.540 --> 00:53:30.420
<v Larry Ogrodnek>file you probably have to click on.

00:53:33.160 --> 00:53:34.880
<v Larry Ogrodnek>And then it's the third one in the list there.

00:53:35.440 --> 00:53:38.080
<v Larry Ogrodnek>But so this is just to talk a little bit about--

00:53:39.640 --> 00:53:40.620
<v Larry Ogrodnek>again, it's a work in progress.

00:53:42.019 --> 00:53:43.920
<v Larry Ogrodnek>But the first version of the events

00:53:43.960 --> 00:53:45.100
<v Larry Ogrodnek>was like, oh, there's a handle event method

00:53:45.140 --> 00:53:46.020
<v Larry Ogrodnek>that all events go to.

00:53:46.100 --> 00:53:47.580
<v Larry Ogrodnek>But that gets to be a little bit of a drag.

00:53:47.860 --> 00:53:49.800
<v Larry Ogrodnek>And so we added this @event decorator.

00:53:50.180 --> 00:53:51.720
<v Larry Ogrodnek>And so you can kind of--

00:53:52.800 --> 00:53:55.260
<v Larry Ogrodnek>instead of having handle event, oh, was the method increment?

00:53:55.560 --> 00:53:57.940
<v Larry Ogrodnek>wasn't decrement, you can just say add event decrement,

00:53:58.060 --> 00:54:02.400
<v Larry Ogrodnek>add event increment, and have those separate functions.

00:54:03.340 --> 00:54:06.100
<v Larry Ogrodnek>And then this is also showing the kind of T-string templating

00:54:06.620 --> 00:54:08.740
<v Larry Ogrodnek>where you use two strings to generate it.

00:54:08.940 --> 00:54:12.240
<v Larry Ogrodnek>And the cool thing with this too is on line 58,

00:54:12.320 --> 00:54:15.480
<v Larry Ogrodnek>you can see basically we're calling self.button,

00:54:15.580 --> 00:54:18.500
<v Larry Ogrodnek>which is a T-string template, and then we're passing in

00:54:18.620 --> 00:54:20.080
<v Larry Ogrodnek>self.decrement, which is the method.

00:54:20.140 --> 00:54:21.360
<v Larry Ogrodnek>And so you can kind of like--

00:54:21.860 --> 00:54:24.460
<v Larry Ogrodnek>I mean, it's basically just doing that binding for you

00:54:24.420 --> 00:54:26.060
<v Larry Ogrodnek>automatically where it ends up--

00:54:26.060 --> 00:54:26.980
<v Michael Kennedy>OK, hold on, hold on.

00:54:27.010 --> 00:54:35.000
<v Michael Kennedy>So people-- you have a t-string, which is kind of Jinja-like.

00:54:36.100 --> 00:54:37.940
<v Michael Kennedy>And in here, you have a format statement.

00:54:38.200 --> 00:54:41.440
<v Michael Kennedy>And one of the values you're putting in here

00:54:42.220 --> 00:54:46.420
<v Michael Kennedy>is literally the function that has the decorator that

00:54:46.560 --> 00:54:46.980
<v Michael Kennedy>is an event.

00:54:47.410 --> 00:54:49.860
<v Michael Kennedy>And then that gets called back through all the magic.

00:54:51.100 --> 00:54:55.960
<v Larry Ogrodnek>Yeah and it's like it's it's a it's like I think it's it's cool that it looks like magic,

00:54:56.090 --> 00:54:59.760
<v Larry Ogrodnek>but it's I mean, it's really not magic. I mean the thing it's like doing the simplest possible

00:54:59.890 --> 00:55:06.360
<v Larry Ogrodnek>thing where basically it just it's saving you from like if you look at that that button method

00:55:06.850 --> 00:55:13.220
<v Larry Ogrodnek>the button template. It's saying like button phx click click equals I see. Okay. So you've

00:55:13.300 --> 00:55:20.020
<v Michael Kennedy>created a wrapper function that then basically writes the component yeah that that'll wire up all

00:55:21.819 --> 00:55:22.580
<v Michael Kennedy>Yeah, that's pretty cool.

00:55:22.900 --> 00:55:25.480
<v Larry Ogrodnek>Yeah, but this is something I think I'm really excited about

00:55:25.780 --> 00:55:28.260
<v Larry Ogrodnek>because it's like, you know,

00:55:28.440 --> 00:55:29.940
<v Larry Ogrodnek>like one of the things that you really want to have,

00:55:30.040 --> 00:55:32.560
<v Larry Ogrodnek>like after you've been making a complex app,

00:55:32.620 --> 00:55:34.280
<v Larry Ogrodnek>is a way to have components.

00:55:35.080 --> 00:55:37.000
<v Larry Ogrodnek>And that was kind of challenging in the templating system

00:55:37.140 --> 00:55:38.600
<v Larry Ogrodnek>that I originally, you know, started using.

00:55:40.620 --> 00:55:41.500
<v Larry Ogrodnek>Not just to have components,

00:55:41.680 --> 00:55:42.640
<v Larry Ogrodnek>because you can have includes and stuff like that,

00:55:42.700 --> 00:55:44.980
<v Larry Ogrodnek>but to fit into like the Phoenix Live View component system.

00:55:45.180 --> 00:55:47.420
<v Larry Ogrodnek>But I think t-strings are exciting for me

00:55:47.500 --> 00:55:50.460
<v Larry Ogrodnek>because it makes things like this really powerful.

00:55:50.700 --> 00:55:56.120
<v Larry Ogrodnek>And you think about like, you know, just even things like, you know, having really smart forms and form binding.

00:55:56.230 --> 00:55:58.900
<v Larry Ogrodnek>And I have some of that, but it's a little clunky.

00:55:59.130 --> 00:56:04.060
<v Larry Ogrodnek>And I think being able to have like really nice, reasonable components that leverage t-strings,

00:56:04.820 --> 00:56:10.860
<v Larry Ogrodnek>make it so you have something that kind of looks very magically, but it's, you know, it's basically just, you know, templating.

00:56:11.920 --> 00:56:12.980
<v Larry Ogrodnek>So, but I'm excited about it.

00:56:12.980 --> 00:56:17.500
<v Larry Ogrodnek>I think it'll make a lot of things easier and easier to kind of share, you know, comments.

00:56:19.000 --> 00:56:19.640
<v Michael Kennedy>I love it.

00:56:19.740 --> 00:56:22.540
<v Michael Kennedy>I really like the programming here, the API.

00:56:23.280 --> 00:56:26.300
<v Michael Kennedy>We've got a little bit-- not a lot-- a little bit of time left here.

00:56:26.300 --> 00:56:29.660
<v Michael Kennedy>So let's touch on, actually, just a couple of things.

00:56:31.240 --> 00:56:33.260
<v Michael Kennedy>I think one of the issues that--

00:56:34.660 --> 00:56:37.040
<v Michael Kennedy>I talked about some of the magic, like some of these frameworks,

00:56:37.130 --> 00:56:38.400
<v Michael Kennedy>like hide away all the things.

00:56:39.200 --> 00:56:43.860
<v Michael Kennedy>Another one where there's these front and back end

00:56:44.080 --> 00:56:47.100
<v Michael Kennedy>connected all Python, they feel like sometimes you're like, OK.

00:56:47.360 --> 00:56:49.920
<v Michael Kennedy>And the way that works is you run it on our cloud system.

00:56:50.910 --> 00:56:51.400
<v Michael Kennedy>You know what I mean?

00:56:51.720 --> 00:56:55.480
<v Michael Kennedy>Or you run it on our special bit of infrastructure.

00:56:57.200 --> 00:57:00.720
<v Michael Kennedy>And then thoughts immediately go to, well, how durable?

00:57:00.960 --> 00:57:02.020
<v Michael Kennedy>How proven is that?

00:57:02.160 --> 00:57:03.540
<v Michael Kennedy>Like, we use Kubernetes?

00:57:03.850 --> 00:57:04.720
<v Michael Kennedy>Could we do it there?

00:57:04.850 --> 00:57:06.320
<v Michael Kennedy>Like, gosh, I don't even know.

00:57:06.760 --> 00:57:08.280
<v Michael Kennedy>So let's talk about some of the internals.

00:57:08.370 --> 00:57:12.360
<v Michael Kennedy>And at its heart, this is Starlet, right,

00:57:12.520 --> 00:57:14.660
<v Michael Kennedy>which is the same as FastAPI in a sense

00:57:15.050 --> 00:57:16.580
<v Michael Kennedy>in terms of how it runs, right?

00:57:17.200 --> 00:57:24.620
<v Larry Ogrodnek>Exactly. Yeah, it's Starlette is doing, you know, all the heavy lifting, you know, and.

00:57:25.400 --> 00:57:27.680
<v Michael Kennedy>It handles the web sockets and everything for you, right?

00:57:27.930 --> 00:57:34.760
<v Larry Ogrodnek>Yeah, the web sockets, the HTTP, the routing, you know, even middleware, also the authentication, like using it for the authentication.

00:57:34.960 --> 00:57:45.080
<v Larry Ogrodnek>I had to do a little bit of work to make that available at the WebSocket level.

00:57:47.040 --> 00:57:54.880
<v Larry Ogrodnek>Because it handles all the routing, but just the way LiveView works is there's really one WebSocket connection that's getting managed.

00:57:55.020 --> 00:57:58.200
<v Larry Ogrodnek>And then internally, there's routing that's done by the framework.

00:57:58.620 --> 00:57:58.860
<v Larry Ogrodnek>I see.

00:57:59.440 --> 00:58:00.740
<v Larry Ogrodnek>Because you never set that up, right?

00:58:00.840 --> 00:58:03.280
<v Michael Kennedy>You don't manage different sockets in different clients.

00:58:03.340 --> 00:58:05.820
<v Michael Kennedy>Like you're just like, I just want to handle event.

00:58:06.620 --> 00:58:06.800
<v Larry Ogrodnek>Exactly.

00:58:07.300 --> 00:58:07.380
<v Larry Ogrodnek>Yeah.

00:58:07.540 --> 00:58:07.700
<v Michael Kennedy>Okay.

00:58:07.900 --> 00:58:11.700
<v Larry Ogrodnek>But, but yeah, but, but, but, but under the covers we're using like, yeah, they're, they're

00:58:11.780 --> 00:58:13.660
<v Larry Ogrodnek>all system and framework.

00:58:13.940 --> 00:58:17.480
<v Larry Ogrodnek>And so if you have, if you use that or familiar with that, it's, it's exactly the same.

00:58:18.180 --> 00:58:19.220
<v Larry Ogrodnek>It's just that we make it also available.

00:58:19.300 --> 00:58:22.620
<v Larry Ogrodnek>I kind of like, you know, for the, at the live view specific layer.

00:58:24.839 --> 00:58:29.400
<v Larry Ogrodnek>But, but yeah, that's, that's, so anywhere you can run Starlette and, you know, I've been

00:58:29.540 --> 00:58:31.140
<v Larry Ogrodnek>mostly like, you know, using it.

00:58:31.240 --> 00:58:33.820
<v Larry Ogrodnek>So that examples website that we're looking at,

00:58:34.040 --> 00:58:37.660
<v Larry Ogrodnek>that is itself a PyView app that is using just

00:58:37.880 --> 00:58:40.060
<v Larry Ogrodnek>Yuvacorn, the place of Docker container.

00:58:40.790 --> 00:58:43.080
<v Larry Ogrodnek>And that's primarily how I've been using it for apps

00:58:43.090 --> 00:58:48.060
<v Larry Ogrodnek>that I've been writing or at work is just a Docker app

00:58:48.810 --> 00:58:49.540
<v Larry Ogrodnek>with Yuvacorn.

00:58:51.090 --> 00:58:57.760
<v Larry Ogrodnek>But presumably, yeah, any HGI thing you could use.

00:59:00.100 --> 00:59:01.180
<v Larry Ogrodnek>So yeah, there's no magic there.

00:59:01.400 --> 00:59:02.400
<v Larry Ogrodnek>Yeah, anywhere you want to run it.

00:59:02.500 --> 00:59:04.520
<v Larry Ogrodnek>The one thing is, this is something that's

00:59:04.640 --> 00:59:07.980
<v Larry Ogrodnek>kind of more of a future thing, but part of--

00:59:07.980 --> 00:59:09.420
<v Larry Ogrodnek>that you don't have to use for a lot of apps,

00:59:09.600 --> 00:59:10.720
<v Larry Ogrodnek>but some of the stuff like presence,

00:59:11.740 --> 00:59:13.860
<v Larry Ogrodnek>like pubsub stuff that we have built in,

00:59:14.600 --> 00:59:15.660
<v Larry Ogrodnek>just because it's kind of something

00:59:15.700 --> 00:59:17.000
<v Larry Ogrodnek>you want to have when you have this kind of framework

00:59:17.240 --> 00:59:19.140
<v Larry Ogrodnek>like you can do stuff very easily.

00:59:19.320 --> 00:59:21.100
<v Larry Ogrodnek>Like I have an example of this, but like,

00:59:21.880 --> 00:59:23.800
<v Larry Ogrodnek>oh, this user joined this page, this user left the page,

00:59:23.960 --> 00:59:24.720
<v Larry Ogrodnek>and doing things like that.

00:59:25.160 --> 00:59:27.480
<v Larry Ogrodnek>I don't have a way right now for that to be like multi-machine.

00:59:27.860 --> 00:59:29.960
<v Larry Ogrodnek>That's really just single machine pubsub implementation

00:59:29.980 --> 00:59:32.260
<v Larry Ogrodnek>So something I'm working on for the future.

00:59:33.400 --> 00:59:34.380
<v Larry Ogrodnek>But yeah, there's no special requirements.

00:59:34.820 --> 00:59:37.040
<v Larry Ogrodnek>Anywhere you're running a Starlette app or Fest API app

00:59:37.050 --> 00:59:40.380
<v Larry Ogrodnek>or whatever should be totally fine.

00:59:40.980 --> 00:59:43.340
<v Larry Ogrodnek>You do want to have sticky sessions set up

00:59:43.560 --> 00:59:47.660
<v Larry Ogrodnek>because it does require you going to the same machine

00:59:47.730 --> 00:59:49.320
<v Larry Ogrodnek>because we have this persistent state for the user.

00:59:50.600 --> 00:59:52.840
<v Michael Kennedy>Yeah, that is tricky with WebSockets.

00:59:52.940 --> 00:59:55.160
<v Michael Kennedy>I've been dealing with that for a project I'm working on.

00:59:57.520 --> 01:00:02.820
<v Michael Kennedy>it's challenging because like okay the natural inclination and a lot of the recommendation is

01:00:02.960 --> 01:00:10.280
<v Michael Kennedy>oh you're gonna how many workers do you want your uveacorn or your granion to run yeah and oh if you

01:00:10.380 --> 01:00:16.560
<v Michael Kennedy>need to scale up you just put behind a load balancer yeah i think it's i i agree with you it is it is

01:00:16.600 --> 01:00:19.800
<v Larry Ogrodnek>challenging but i think it's like i think it's it's a solvable challenge and i think also like

01:00:19.800 --> 01:00:25.220
<v Larry Ogrodnek>it depends on kind of the app that you want like for some use cases i mean you know the sticky part

01:00:25.240 --> 01:00:26.960
<v Larry Ogrodnek>you kind of need right now anyway.

01:00:27.120 --> 01:00:28.740
<v Larry Ogrodnek>But for some use cases, maybe you don't care about

01:00:29.280 --> 01:00:31.160
<v Larry Ogrodnek>the PubSub or the presence, or maybe you have

01:00:31.160 --> 01:00:32.380
<v Larry Ogrodnek>a way to deal with that already.

01:00:32.840 --> 01:00:34.940
<v Michael Kennedy>If you don't care about PubSub or presence, then

01:00:35.360 --> 01:00:36.640
<v Larry Ogrodnek>as long as it just sticks to...

01:00:36.760 --> 01:00:39.160
<v Larry Ogrodnek>As long as it just sticks. And even the stickiness, I feel like there's

01:00:39.420 --> 01:00:40.980
<v Larry Ogrodnek>potential solutions there, right? Because like

01:00:41.540 --> 01:00:43.060
<v Larry Ogrodnek>with the model, it really

01:00:43.200 --> 01:00:44.860
<v Larry Ogrodnek>is like, you know, like

01:00:45.120 --> 01:00:46.500
<v Larry Ogrodnek>we saw in examples, like you

01:00:47.100 --> 01:00:49.100
<v Larry Ogrodnek>get past this context to operate

01:00:49.360 --> 01:00:51.000
<v Larry Ogrodnek>on, you make changes to it,

01:00:51.780 --> 01:00:53.160
<v Larry Ogrodnek>and you don't really care

01:00:53.480 --> 01:00:55.220
<v Larry Ogrodnek>like where that came from or where it's running.

01:00:55.710 --> 01:00:57.260
<v Larry Ogrodnek>And so theoretically, I think it feels like

01:00:57.260 --> 01:00:59.440
<v Larry Ogrodnek>there could be a situation where that is somehow distributed

01:00:59.840 --> 01:01:01.300
<v Larry Ogrodnek>or there's some kind of shared storage

01:01:01.660 --> 01:01:04.100
<v Larry Ogrodnek>or, you know, it doesn't seem like impossible.

01:01:04.370 --> 01:01:05.680
<v Larry Ogrodnek>I don't know that it'd be worth the complexity

01:01:05.850 --> 01:01:09.380
<v Larry Ogrodnek>for a lot of use cases, but I feel like there's sort of challenge.

01:01:09.520 --> 01:01:11.300
<v Larry Ogrodnek>And the PubSub stuff, I think, is something that, you know,

01:01:11.310 --> 01:01:12.180
<v Larry Ogrodnek>I plan to kind of address.

01:01:12.270 --> 01:01:15.300
<v Larry Ogrodnek>So I think, again, it's like if you're okay with running Redis,

01:01:16.540 --> 01:01:18.100
<v Larry Ogrodnek>then that's a very solvable problem too,

01:01:18.290 --> 01:01:19.680
<v Larry Ogrodnek>having like multi-machine PubSub.

01:01:21.059 --> 01:01:21.920
<v Michael Kennedy>Right, right, right.

01:01:22.080 --> 01:01:26.940
<v Michael Kennedy>Redis or Valkey have like this WebSocket broker thing,

01:01:28.140 --> 01:01:30.700
<v Michael Kennedy>kind of which will manage, basically,

01:01:30.740 --> 01:01:32.700
<v Michael Kennedy>I imagine like your WebSocket connection talks

01:01:33.180 --> 01:01:36.020
<v Michael Kennedy>to your server, which then like puts you in the session

01:01:36.260 --> 01:01:37.740
<v Michael Kennedy>of a Redis or Valkey one,

01:01:38.200 --> 01:01:40.740
<v Michael Kennedy>but then that thing actually does the Pub/Sub across.

01:01:40.980 --> 01:01:42.880
<v Larry Ogrodnek>- Yeah, and that could be interesting for like,

01:01:42.940 --> 01:01:44.800
<v Larry Ogrodnek>I mean, like one of the early things I was thinking is like,

01:01:44.800 --> 01:01:46.020
<v Larry Ogrodnek>oh, could I could deploy this with like,

01:01:46.280 --> 01:01:49.000
<v Larry Ogrodnek>ABUS Lambda, you know, which like seems kind of impossible,

01:01:49.260 --> 01:01:51.380
<v Larry Ogrodnek>but then they do have like with their API gateway,

01:01:51.640 --> 01:01:55.400
<v Larry Ogrodnek>they have like a WebSocket broker

01:01:55.700 --> 01:01:57.320
<v Larry Ogrodnek>where they manage WebSocket connections

01:01:57.920 --> 01:01:59.160
<v Larry Ogrodnek>and you just kind of get events like,

01:01:59.580 --> 01:02:03.240
<v Larry Ogrodnek>oh, this WebSocket client 125 joined, whatever,

01:02:03.840 --> 01:02:04.900
<v Larry Ogrodnek>and then you kind of manage that.

01:02:05.020 --> 01:02:06.900
<v Larry Ogrodnek>And it kind of would be cool, just, I don't know,

01:02:07.220 --> 01:02:08.840
<v Larry Ogrodnek>if a proof of concept or just if you really wanted

01:02:08.940 --> 01:02:11.540
<v Larry Ogrodnek>to host on Lambda or something like that,

01:02:11.660 --> 01:02:13.140
<v Larry Ogrodnek>but it's not, I don't know that I'll get to that

01:02:13.220 --> 01:02:14.580
<v Larry Ogrodnek>anytime soon, you know, but I did.

01:02:14.840 --> 01:02:15.100
<v Michael Kennedy>Yeah, yeah.

01:02:17.440 --> 01:02:19.860
<v Michael Kennedy>Well, certainly an interesting project

01:02:20.180 --> 01:02:20.760
<v Michael Kennedy>with the way it is.

01:02:20.800 --> 01:02:24.000
<v Michael Kennedy>and could certainly go farther.

01:02:24.300 --> 01:02:26.220
<v Michael Kennedy>A lot of the frameworks that are good at this scale out,

01:02:27.120 --> 01:02:29.580
<v Michael Kennedy>they don't have any presence or collaboration.

01:02:30.020 --> 01:02:30.920
<v Michael Kennedy>So it's fine.

01:02:31.500 --> 01:02:31.800
<v Michael Kennedy>Yeah.

01:02:32.150 --> 01:02:33.300
<v Larry Ogrodnek>No, it's a good problem to have.

01:02:33.480 --> 01:02:38.220
<v Larry Ogrodnek>But yeah, something we'll figure out at some point.

01:02:38.440 --> 01:02:39.580
<v Larry Ogrodnek>But I think there's still a lot of co-ops

01:02:39.610 --> 01:02:40.340
<v Larry Ogrodnek>you can write without it.

01:02:40.500 --> 01:02:41.500
<v Michael Kennedy>So it hasn't been a huge priority.

01:02:41.980 --> 01:02:43.420
<v Michael Kennedy>No, it's very, very neat.

01:02:44.640 --> 01:02:45.080
<v Michael Kennedy>All right.

01:02:45.170 --> 01:02:48.280
<v Michael Kennedy>So I got two quick questions for you here.

01:02:49.240 --> 01:02:53.640
<v Michael Kennedy>One, you mentioned LLMs at the beginning.

01:02:55.240 --> 01:02:58.240
<v Michael Kennedy>How do LLMs do with writing PyView?

01:02:59.720 --> 01:03:02.780
<v Michael Kennedy>And do you have tips for making it more knowledgeable?

01:03:03.820 --> 01:03:06.340
<v Michael Kennedy>Do you have some sort of specification

01:03:06.800 --> 01:03:10.400
<v Michael Kennedy>file you can give to Claude or something and say,

01:03:10.620 --> 01:03:12.480
<v Michael Kennedy>I know you might not be familiar with this,

01:03:12.490 --> 01:03:13.380
<v Michael Kennedy>but here's what it is.

01:03:14.740 --> 01:03:16.680
<v Michael Kennedy>Now I'm going to ask you questions to work with it.

01:03:18.020 --> 01:03:19.780
<v Larry Ogrodnek>That's a really good push.

01:03:19.860 --> 01:03:21.300
<v Larry Ogrodnek>I feel like I should do something like that.

01:03:21.800 --> 01:03:29.840
<v Larry Ogrodnek>So I have used elements to write application code,

01:03:29.880 --> 01:03:32.760
<v Larry Ogrodnek>like using PyView framework like you're describing at work a lot.

01:03:32.980 --> 01:03:34.980
<v Larry Ogrodnek>And it's been mostly successful.

01:03:35.260 --> 01:03:37.260
<v Larry Ogrodnek>I think one of the things is it helps

01:03:37.480 --> 01:03:39.360
<v Larry Ogrodnek>that the templating language--

01:03:40.420 --> 01:03:44.480
<v Larry Ogrodnek>we're not using 3.14 at work yet for these projects.

01:03:44.560 --> 01:03:46.100
<v Larry Ogrodnek>And so we're using the older style templates.

01:03:46.220 --> 01:03:48.440
<v Larry Ogrodnek>it helps that that language is very, very similar to Jinja 2.

01:03:50.040 --> 01:03:52.460
<v Larry Ogrodnek>And so that's been great.

01:03:52.860 --> 01:03:54.840
<v Larry Ogrodnek>It does get confused sometimes where, obviously,

01:03:55.120 --> 01:03:56.560
<v Larry Ogrodnek>we don't have the same set of built-in filters.

01:03:56.740 --> 01:03:58.680
<v Larry Ogrodnek>And so I might try to use a filter that's only in Jinja 2

01:03:58.720 --> 01:04:02.700
<v Larry Ogrodnek>that we don't have or that includes syntax

01:04:02.840 --> 01:04:03.460
<v Larry Ogrodnek>is slightly different.

01:04:03.660 --> 01:04:05.080
<v Larry Ogrodnek>So those that gets tripped up on--

01:04:05.260 --> 01:04:07.220
<v Larry Ogrodnek>I think I've had a lot of success

01:04:07.400 --> 01:04:11.420
<v Larry Ogrodnek>with just really simple prompts like this is PyView.

01:04:12.180 --> 01:04:14.040
<v Larry Ogrodnek>It's Phoenix LiveView, but in Python.

01:04:14.420 --> 01:04:15.820
<v Larry Ogrodnek>And that's gotten a lot of mileage,

01:04:16.460 --> 01:04:18.060
<v Larry Ogrodnek>just even something basic like that.

01:04:20.059 --> 01:04:22.800
<v Michael Kennedy>- It sounds like you could create a Claude skill

01:04:23.160 --> 01:04:26.560
<v Michael Kennedy>or an agent or just a set of really structured rules files

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:28.240
<v Michael Kennedy>and maybe put it on the docs and say,

01:04:29.030 --> 01:04:30.820
<v Michael Kennedy>here, grab it and throw this in.

01:04:31.120 --> 01:04:32.560
<v Larry Ogrodnek>- I for sure should do that.

01:04:32.610 --> 01:04:33.920
<v Larry Ogrodnek>Yeah, I don't think that'd be helpful for me too.

01:04:33.990 --> 01:04:35.260
<v Larry Ogrodnek>I think that's something that I kind of,

01:04:36.380 --> 01:04:37.840
<v Larry Ogrodnek>yeah, just even personally wanna get better at

01:04:37.960 --> 01:04:39.340
<v Larry Ogrodnek>is like, yeah, I've been using these tools a lot

01:04:39.480 --> 01:04:40.480
<v Larry Ogrodnek>for development and they've been great,

01:04:40.590 --> 01:04:43.760
<v Larry Ogrodnek>but I've been somewhat lazy in terms of like

01:04:43.780 --> 01:04:47.640
<v Larry Ogrodnek>improving my workflow and I do see how it's like very successful when people

01:04:47.860 --> 01:04:51.100
<v Larry Ogrodnek>kind of structure these things a little better in terms of like having custom

01:04:51.220 --> 01:04:53.560
<v Larry Ogrodnek>commands or yeah, like agents that know about specific things.

01:04:54.190 --> 01:04:54.700
<v Larry Ogrodnek>It does seem like.

01:04:54.800 --> 01:04:56.740
<v Michael Kennedy>But I do think that your cookie cutter helps.

01:04:57.720 --> 01:04:57.820
<v Michael Kennedy>Right.

01:04:57.940 --> 01:04:58.000
<v Michael Kennedy>Right.

01:04:58.170 --> 01:05:00.720
<v Michael Kennedy>Cause it's, it says, okay, here's, here's the structure.

01:05:01.020 --> 01:05:02.620
<v Michael Kennedy>Here's a little working bit of it.

01:05:03.040 --> 01:05:03.940
<v Michael Kennedy>Now keep building on that.

01:05:03.950 --> 01:05:04.840
<v Michael Kennedy>That goes a long ways.

01:05:05.260 --> 01:05:05.860
<v Larry Ogrodnek>Oh, for sure.

01:05:06.540 --> 01:05:09.620
<v Larry Ogrodnek>And I think even like having things like the just file seemed to help in terms

01:05:09.820 --> 01:05:13.680
<v Larry Ogrodnek>of like, it doesn't, you know, it knows like, Oh, to run tests or on just tests.

01:05:13.820 --> 01:05:15.300
<v Larry Ogrodnek>to run type check or run just type check.

01:05:15.390 --> 01:05:16.700
<v Larry Ogrodnek>Like it kind of knows a lot of this stuff,

01:05:18.040 --> 01:05:19.320
<v Larry Ogrodnek>doesn't have to guess about it,

01:05:19.880 --> 01:05:20.940
<v Larry Ogrodnek>but it kind of would be useful.

01:05:21.100 --> 01:05:22.220
<v Larry Ogrodnek>I do find it like, it's funny.

01:05:22.250 --> 01:05:24.400
<v Larry Ogrodnek>It seems like the LMS get confused a lot about like,

01:05:24.800 --> 01:05:27.660
<v Larry Ogrodnek>oh, do I need to run poetry run versus just Python?

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:29.520
<v Larry Ogrodnek>And it seems to always forget like

01:05:30.560 --> 01:05:32.520
<v Larry Ogrodnek>how your project is set up, you know?

01:05:33.299 --> 01:05:34.240
<v Michael Kennedy>- Yeah, I know.

01:05:34.790 --> 01:05:36.280
<v Michael Kennedy>You gotta keep reminding it.

01:05:37.120 --> 01:05:38.480
<v Michael Kennedy>All right, so that was question one.

01:05:38.490 --> 01:05:40.120
<v Michael Kennedy>The question two, final question.

01:05:40.880 --> 01:05:41.540
<v Michael Kennedy>What's the roadmap?

01:05:43.480 --> 01:05:44.300
<v Michael Kennedy>You open to contributors.

01:05:45.700 --> 01:05:46.360
<v Michael Kennedy>Where are we?

01:05:46.560 --> 01:05:50.120
<v Larry Ogrodnek>Yeah, so like you mentioned, it's very early days,

01:05:50.640 --> 01:05:54.620
<v Larry Ogrodnek>and I've tried to be conservative about breaking changes,

01:05:54.820 --> 01:05:57.300
<v Larry Ogrodnek>but I think as we start getting closer to 1.0,

01:05:57.380 --> 01:05:58.540
<v Larry Ogrodnek>I think I'm at 0.8.0,

01:05:59.060 --> 01:06:00.260
<v Larry Ogrodnek>there probably will be some breaking changes

01:06:00.360 --> 01:06:02.540
<v Larry Ogrodnek>because as we've already seen in some of the examples,

01:06:03.160 --> 01:06:05.820
<v Larry Ogrodnek>I've gone through multiple iterations of how do I make this easier?

01:06:05.960 --> 01:06:06.840
<v Larry Ogrodnek>How do I make this easier?

01:06:07.480 --> 01:06:08.880
<v Larry Ogrodnek>And that's been a big focus for me

01:06:08.940 --> 01:06:11.040
<v Larry Ogrodnek>is making it really developer-friendly and simple.

01:06:11.200 --> 01:06:13.440
<v Larry Ogrodnek>And so I think I'll try and make some stuff a little more cohesive

01:06:14.480 --> 01:06:15.440
<v Larry Ogrodnek>So there may be some breaking changes.

01:06:17.100 --> 01:06:20.380
<v Larry Ogrodnek>But yeah, I mean, I want it to be super easy to get up and running,

01:06:20.580 --> 01:06:22.160
<v Larry Ogrodnek>and I feel like there's work to do there.

01:06:22.180 --> 01:06:25.440
<v Larry Ogrodnek>I think the short-term roadmap is, again, I want to keep working on

01:06:25.580 --> 01:06:26.740
<v Larry Ogrodnek>documentation updates, examples.

01:06:27.660 --> 01:06:31.000
<v Larry Ogrodnek>I saw a really great YouTube talk recently called "Verbs Not Nouns"

01:06:31.600 --> 01:06:35.780
<v Larry Ogrodnek>by Brian McDonald about how to make your documentation more task-based.

01:06:35.860 --> 01:06:38.080
<v Larry Ogrodnek>What is the person trying to do versus expanding technology?

01:06:39.240 --> 01:06:39.800
<v Larry Ogrodnek>So I want to do that.

01:06:39.800 --> 01:06:45.800
<v Larry Ogrodnek>Like I said, I think the T-string templating is very exciting in terms of making that better,

01:06:46.280 --> 01:06:52.100
<v Larry Ogrodnek>figuring out the CSS story around that. That's one thing that's annoying is writing CSS in

01:06:53.020 --> 01:06:59.740
<v Larry Ogrodnek>t-strings because you have double escape all the curly braces. Better form support. I have some

01:06:59.920 --> 01:07:07.760
<v Larry Ogrodnek>initial form support that uses Pydantic. But I want to make that a little better. And at work,

01:07:07.780 --> 01:07:11.320
<v Larry Ogrodnek>I've had situations where we have very complex nested forms.

01:07:11.500 --> 01:07:14.580
<v Larry Ogrodnek>And I would love to get to a point where it's just like, yeah, you just throw, here's my

01:07:14.760 --> 01:07:18.920
<v Larry Ogrodnek>pandemic data model, make a form with error handling and all this stuff and validation.

01:07:19.260 --> 01:07:20.300
<v Larry Ogrodnek>And I kind of want to get there.

01:07:20.340 --> 01:07:26.980
<v Larry Ogrodnek>And then I think, again, larger examples, I think you called out the Phoenix Live View

01:07:27.640 --> 01:07:28.300
<v Larry Ogrodnek>Pi Beats example.

01:07:28.460 --> 01:07:30.380
<v Larry Ogrodnek>They have this very big music player.

01:07:30.420 --> 01:07:34.760
<v Larry Ogrodnek>And I have some things like that where I have an AI chat example that are slightly larger,

01:07:35.020 --> 01:07:37.080
<v Larry Ogrodnek>but coming up with some more examples to kind of inspire people,

01:07:37.170 --> 01:07:38.360
<v Larry Ogrodnek>like what can actually be done.

01:07:39.080 --> 01:07:43.480
<v Michael Kennedy>Could you fully implement the live beats thing in PyView?

01:07:44.160 --> 01:07:45.120
<v Larry Ogrodnek>Yes, I can.

01:07:45.250 --> 01:07:46.700
<v Larry Ogrodnek>And I was thinking about doing it.

01:07:46.700 --> 01:07:48.480
<v Larry Ogrodnek>I think, you know, it's a little, it's interesting,

01:07:48.570 --> 01:07:49.340
<v Larry Ogrodnek>like the history there.

01:07:50.060 --> 01:07:51.780
<v Larry Ogrodnek>I mean, I don't know, like the real,

01:07:52.160 --> 01:07:54.460
<v Larry Ogrodnek>but like my intuition is that like part of it was that

01:07:54.620 --> 01:07:55.700
<v Larry Ogrodnek>as they were building certain technologies,

01:07:55.750 --> 01:07:57.520
<v Larry Ogrodnek>they wanted to show them off and have a good test bed.

01:07:57.530 --> 01:08:00.900
<v Larry Ogrodnek>And so like the way that it works is like based on like file uploads,

01:08:00.970 --> 01:08:02.660
<v Larry Ogrodnek>like you upload MP3s that you want to play.

01:08:03.940 --> 01:08:07.980
<v Larry Ogrodnek>And I feel like that's, I mean, it's because they wanted to show off the file upload stuff, which was new at the time, I think.

01:08:08.040 --> 01:08:08.760
<v Larry Ogrodnek>And I could do that.

01:08:08.790 --> 01:08:09.560
<v Larry Ogrodnek>I have file upload support.

01:08:09.900 --> 01:08:15.000
<v Larry Ogrodnek>In fact, I have like even multi-part S3, like very advanced file upload support.

01:08:16.420 --> 01:08:18.839
<v Larry Ogrodnek>But I was thinking about doing it, but just doing streaming.

01:08:19.220 --> 01:08:25.440
<v Larry Ogrodnek>You know, I think I found like a streaming service that is for like royalty-free music if you're using it in a non-commercial way.

01:08:25.529 --> 01:08:31.000
<v Larry Ogrodnek>And I think that might be more exciting to show off like present stuff and even some JavaScript integration stuff and like synchronizing stuff.

01:08:31.140 --> 01:08:37.540
<v Larry Ogrodnek>So, and I think also like I have a simple AI chat thing, but I think maybe biffing up a little bit would be kind of cool too.

01:08:37.609 --> 01:08:42.520
<v Larry Ogrodnek>Because I know people are into AI stuff, but you mentioned like contributions.

01:08:42.589 --> 01:08:44.500
<v Larry Ogrodnek>And I think, yeah, for sure.

01:08:44.790 --> 01:08:53.400
<v Larry Ogrodnek>I think the thing that like, to be honest, would be the most helpful is to have people like, you know, try it, try writing an app, a simple app or a complex app, whatever.

01:08:53.589 --> 01:09:00.819
<v Larry Ogrodnek>And like, I really want to hear like, you know, what works well, like what's rough, what's confusing, like what could be better, like any feedback.

01:09:02.600 --> 01:09:04.720
<v Michael Kennedy>yeah more than people contributing features

01:09:04.980 --> 01:09:06.880
<v Michael Kennedy>it's people just using it to make sure it works

01:09:07.060 --> 01:09:08.779
<v Michael Kennedy>and giving feedback on how it should be right

01:09:08.900 --> 01:09:10.980
<v Larry Ogrodnek>yeah no and contribution features are good too

01:09:11.140 --> 01:09:12.080
<v Larry Ogrodnek>I mean I recently set up

01:09:12.960 --> 01:09:14.540
<v Larry Ogrodnek>also just a call on GitHub

01:09:14.980 --> 01:09:16.540
<v Larry Ogrodnek>the repo there's also like a discussions thing

01:09:16.609 --> 01:09:18.359
<v Larry Ogrodnek>it doesn't have a lot of things right there

01:09:18.359 --> 01:09:19.520
<v Larry Ogrodnek>I mean there's two topics right now

01:09:20.109 --> 01:09:22.580
<v Larry Ogrodnek>but you know because I do want to get more feedback

01:09:22.819 --> 01:09:23.279
<v Larry Ogrodnek>and encourage feedback

01:09:23.430 --> 01:09:26.160
<v Larry Ogrodnek>and like I think that's a great place to put features suggestions

01:09:26.460 --> 01:09:28.020
<v Larry Ogrodnek>but yeah I mean contributions are

01:09:30.180 --> 01:09:30.900
<v Larry Ogrodnek>also welcome

01:09:30.920 --> 01:09:35.440
<v Larry Ogrodnek>But I just can't underscore enough how much I want to have feedback.

01:09:35.600 --> 01:09:41.700
<v Larry Ogrodnek>Because, again, I want it to be a really great app that people feel is fun to use.

01:09:41.759 --> 01:09:42.640
<v Larry Ogrodnek>And they like using it.

01:09:42.640 --> 01:09:43.580
<v Larry Ogrodnek>And it's easy to get started.

01:09:43.799 --> 01:09:46.400
<v Larry Ogrodnek>And I know that it's not there yet.

01:09:47.520 --> 01:09:50.839
<v Larry Ogrodnek>But any help to getting there would be great.

01:09:51.380 --> 01:09:51.779
<v Michael Kennedy>Yeah.

01:09:52.460 --> 01:09:52.940
<v Michael Kennedy>Very cool.

01:09:53.940 --> 01:09:56.800
<v Michael Kennedy>Well, Larry, thanks for being on the show.

01:09:58.000 --> 01:09:58.700
<v Michael Kennedy>Very cool project.

01:09:58.860 --> 01:10:01.880
<v Michael Kennedy>I think people should certainly at least give it a look to see.

01:10:02.780 --> 01:10:05.780
<v Michael Kennedy>Maybe it'll help them go get their app up and running.

01:10:06.250 --> 01:10:09.000
<v Michael Kennedy>Nice little interactive app way quicker than maybe they thought they could.

01:10:09.460 --> 01:10:10.540
<v Larry Ogrodnek>Yeah, thanks so much, Michael.

01:10:10.700 --> 01:10:13.200
<v Larry Ogrodnek>Yeah, I really appreciate the chance to come on and talk to you about this.

01:10:13.320 --> 01:10:14.280
<v Larry Ogrodnek>It's been a lot of fun.

01:10:14.280 --> 01:10:18.220
<v Larry Ogrodnek>I can't believe how much we talked about and how much more we could talk about.

01:10:19.480 --> 01:10:22.740
<v Michael Kennedy>I've got a browser full of tabs of things we didn't even get to.

01:10:23.680 --> 01:10:24.120
<v Michael Kennedy>Yeah, sorry.

01:10:26.740 --> 01:10:27.300
<v Michael Kennedy>Now that's how it goes.

01:10:27.450 --> 01:10:27.640
<v Michael Kennedy>All right.

01:10:28.040 --> 01:10:30.100
<v Michael Kennedy>Thanks for being here. Catch you later. Bye, everyone.

01:10:30.440 --> 01:10:30.480
<v Michael Kennedy>Bye.
