1
00:00:01,219 --> 00:00:02,820
Michael Kennedy: David, welcome back to Talk Python To Me.

2
00:00:03,670 --> 00:00:05,940
David Kopec: Thank you so much for having me back, Michael. It's really an honor.

3
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:08,740
Michael Kennedy: Yeah, it's an honor to be here with you.

4
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:14,880
Michael Kennedy: Got some really fun stuff to talk about, computer science from scratch.

5
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:19,500
Michael Kennedy: What does that even mean? We're going to find out, because you wrote the book on it.

6
00:00:20,510 --> 00:00:21,260
Michael Kennedy: And we're going to dive in.

7
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:26,000
David Kopec: Yeah, I'm excited. And this book just came out, so it's kind of fresh off the press.

8
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:29,280
David Kopec: And I want to thank you for being the technical reviewer on the book, actually.

9
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:40,260
Michael Kennedy: Yeah, it was really fun. You reached out and asked me. I don't normally do things like that, but I'm like, you know, that'd be kind of fun. It would be a good experience. And I do think it was.

10
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:44,340
Michael Kennedy: It taught me some about creating books and I guess that pays off as well.

11
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:48,500
David Kopec: And congratulations, by the way, on Talk Python in production coming out.

12
00:00:49,059 --> 00:01:00,340
Michael Kennedy: Yeah, thanks. I started that last December and it came out, I think the beginning of this month, maybe end of September, something like that, but pretty recently. So yeah, I really appreciate it.

13
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:05,480
Michael Kennedy: It's going really well. We're in kind of the same phase because Computer Science from Scratch

14
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:20,520
David Kopec: officially came out end of September also. So we're just in this kind of, you know, one month out from these books coming out. And so I think it's an exciting time for both of us. And I've started reading Python in production and I'm really loving it. So congrats on it. Awesome. Thank you. And I

15
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:28,060
Michael Kennedy: really enjoyed your book and I had to read it with a little more detail than just appreciate it, I had to take notes and help you with some feedback.

16
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,320
Michael Kennedy: So that was a really cool experience, and thanks.

17
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:36,220
Michael Kennedy: You know, it's been six, almost, over five years, let's put it that way.

18
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:38,560
Michael Kennedy: It's been over five years since you've been on the show.

19
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:43,780
Michael Kennedy: We talked about classic computer science programs in Python, I believe it was.

20
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:53,540
Michael Kennedy: Yeah, that was really a fun and popular episode, but let's do a quick refresher, a quick introduction for you to everyone who's new to the show in the last five years.

21
00:01:54,340 --> 00:02:01,240
David Kopec: Okay, so I'm a computer. My name is David Kopech. I'm a computer science professor at Albright College in Redding, Pennsylvania.

22
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:07,600
David Kopec: I actually just moved over here from Champlain College, where I was for the past nine years in a similar role.

23
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:11,160
David Kopec: And I'm also the program director of computer science and information technology.

24
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:19,400
David Kopec: We're launching three new majors, a little plug for Albright, a revamped computer science major, an artificial intelligence major, and cybersecurity.

25
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:23,080
David Kopec: And so I'm managing the launch of those for fall 2026.

26
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:28,060
David Kopec: My background is for the past decade, obviously, as a computer science educator.

27
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:38,340
David Kopec: I've written five books on computer science and programming, the most successful of which was Classic Computer Science Problems in Python, which, of course, I was on the show five years ago about.

28
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:43,100
David Kopec: And this book, Computer Science from Scratch, is kind of for a similar audience.

29
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:55,540
David Kopec: Both books are for Python programmers, folks who are intermediate or advanced Python programmers, but maybe who want to fill in the kind of computer science topics that they don't know, maybe because they're self-educated.

30
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,400
David Kopec: Maybe they learned Python on their own.

31
00:02:57,410 --> 00:02:58,800
David Kopec: They didn't have a formal CS degree.

32
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:08,700
David Kopec: Or maybe they did have a formal CS degree, but now they're preparing for interviews or transitioning to a more CS in-depth role, and they want to refresh on some of these topics.

33
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:13,860
David Kopec: So both books are for folks who know Python but want to go deeper on CS.

34
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:14,660
Michael Kennedy: Right.

35
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:18,900
Michael Kennedy: Here's how you do a loop in Python, or here's what InterTools is.

36
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:22,220
Michael Kennedy: It's true, computer science topics, right?

37
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:23,060
David Kopec: Right.

38
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:26,380
David Kopec: And I think somebody at that stage will be very frustrated by the books.

39
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:27,560
David Kopec: They really are.

40
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:29,200
Speaker 3: And so we have to put that preface in.

41
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:32,320
David Kopec: They really are for intermediate or advanced Python programmers.

42
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:40,480
David Kopec: So, you know, so I'm trying to reach the same audience, but they're totally different books in terms of the type of topics they cover.

43
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:45,920
David Kopec: So classic computer science problems in Python was more of a data structures and algorithms type of book.

44
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:50,880
David Kopec: Did some AI type topics as well, but very much on the algorithm side.

45
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:59,200
David Kopec: Computer science from scratch is more, let's build up the layers of the software stack from the bottom up that Python kind of runs on top of.

46
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,540
David Kopec: So you understand what's actually happening under the hood.

47
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:03,340
David Kopec: So how does an interpreter work?

48
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:06,180
David Kopec: What's the hardware software interface like?

49
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:07,620
David Kopec: We get that with emulators.

50
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:10,380
David Kopec: And then there is still some algorithmic stuff as well.

51
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:16,459
David Kopec: different topics than in the prior book, but stuff like a little computer art stuff, a little bit of machine learning.

52
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:18,579
David Kopec: So we try, it's still a survey book.

53
00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:24,320
David Kopec: It's still pretty broad, but it's more about the layers of the software stack than classic computer science problems in Python was.

54
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:25,280
Michael Kennedy: Yeah.

55
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:26,340
Michael Kennedy: Yeah.

56
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:27,640
Michael Kennedy: There's some pretty low level stuff.

57
00:04:27,690 --> 00:04:43,600
Michael Kennedy: And it's interesting you're doing in Python, you know, a lot of, I think a lot of times that would be taught in at least a pointer based language, you know, like C or you can even see it being taught in assembly, like you're talking to the machine, like literally.

58
00:04:44,760 --> 00:05:03,580
David Kopec: Absolutely. And you know, if you took these classes, like if you took an architecture class, which I'm going to be teaching next semester at Albright, it's going to be an assembly language, right? And if you took a compilers course, it's usually in something like C or today, it might be in a Rust, a low level language where you do have that direct access to memory.

59
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:22,300
David Kopec: But I wanted to make the book accessible. And Python is the most accessible language in the world, it's the most popular language in the world, and it's the language that we're increasingly using in computer science education anyway. So it is actually a little unusual to cover some of these topics in Python, but it makes the topics accessible to a much wider audience.

60
00:05:22,820 --> 00:06:02,900
Michael Kennedy: Yeah. It definitely makes it accessible to a wider audience. Let's take a step back and talk about this role you have in this new college university you're at. So you said that you're revamping the CS program, you're adding AI and cybersecurity. That's a big shift. Do you want to just talk to people about how that's changing, why you decided to change? I look at a lot of CS programs and I don't know how connected they are to the real world. So I imagine some of these changes are to sort of realign it with what's happened recently. Absolutely. Yeah. So I'm coming from

61
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:12,500
David Kopec: a college, the Champlain College in Vermont, where I was at for nine years, which was a professionally focused college. So it was a college where we were preparing students for their careers.

62
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:32,060
David Kopec: I moved now to Albright, which is a liberal arts college. So it's a college that's more teaching people how to think, creating great citizens, and hopefully we prepare them for their careers very well too. But there's that liberal arts foundation underneath everything. So one of the challenges in developing these three new majors was how do you fit them into a liberal arts curriculum?

63
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:36,120
David Kopec: And how do you make them relevant to careers while still being true to the liberal arts?

64
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:42,580
David Kopec: And so what I found the best way to do it is to still focus on how to help people think computationally.

65
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:48,000
David Kopec: And so there's a firm foundation of computer science and mathematics throughout all three majors.

66
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:55,140
David Kopec: So whether you're doing cybersecurity, artificial intelligence, or computer science, you're going to have a lot of classes in common with one another.

67
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:59,220
David Kopec: And we also need to infuse some of the issues we see in the workforce today.

68
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:02,800
David Kopec: Like all of them will have a computer ethics course that's incorporated.

69
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:06,280
David Kopec: And all of them will have an internship course that's incorporated.

70
00:07:06,290 --> 00:07:09,780
David Kopec: So students are getting real world experience as they're going through these majors.

71
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,560
Michael Kennedy: I think that's a great idea.

72
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:25,120
Michael Kennedy: It's really important to have done software engineering hands-on with other companies, real products, and real product managers, in addition to just knowing the algorithms and foundations.

73
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:26,400
David Kopec: Absolutely.

74
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:27,220
David Kopec: I couldn't agree more.

75
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:29,480
David Kopec: And so we're trying to blend the two.

76
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:32,360
David Kopec: And that's been one of the exciting things.

77
00:07:32,560 --> 00:08:07,640
David Kopec: and you asked why I changed, I was excited about this opportunity to build these new majors from the ground up. We'll be one of the first teaching colleges, small teaching colleges, to offer an artificial intelligence major. It's just been in the last five years that we've seen colleges start to offer an undergraduate major in artificial intelligence. And it's mostly been big name brand colleges like CMU that are offering these first artificial intelligence bachelor's degrees. But we get to be at the forefront of how do you fit that into a small liberal arts college and still make it career relevant and still have that firm liberal arts foundation.

78
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:14,560
Michael Kennedy: Are you concerned about not all these hackers in on your network if you're teaching a cybersecurity?

79
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:19,240
Michael Kennedy: Well, I won't be teaching the cybersecurity courses. So I'm firmly just in the computer

80
00:08:19,350 --> 00:08:58,000
David Kopec: science education course, and we're hiring additional faculty in cybersecurity and in artificial intelligence. I'm more on the management side of those two programs. But, you know, look, it's more relevant than ever. When you look at actually the number of students going to college for cybersecurity, it's been exploding over the last decade. You know, I just talked about how artificial intelligence has just come about as a bachelor's degree. Cybersecurity was kind of there 15 years ago. So cybersecurity started out as maybe you took a computer security course at the end of your computer science degree. Then it became a concentration you could do within some computer science degrees. And then in the 2010s, it broke out and became its own bachelor's degree.

81
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:36,480
David Kopec: And so we're seeing the same thing right now with AI. It started out, you know, when you did undergrad computer science, maybe in the 90s, or like me and the OOs, you might have one course, like an intro to AI course that you have at the end of your bachelor's degree. Then it started to be something where you do a concentration at Champlain, I developed a concentration in artificial intelligence. Now, just in the last five years, we're seeing it break out from being just a part of a CS degree to being its whole own, you know, adjacent degree. So I think it's an exciting time for that. Of course, there's a hype cycle right now about AI. So a lot of colleges are jumping in. And I think some of them are doing it the right way. And, you know, having that firm

82
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:40,740
Speaker 3: foundation in computer science and mathematics, so it's durable. And some of them are doing it in

83
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:50,800
Michael Kennedy: kind of a shallow way. We're trying to do it the right way. Yeah, that sounds great. And obviously, cybersecurity is one of those things that's highly valuable.

84
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:54,180
Speaker 3: Nobody wants to be in the news for that reason, right?

85
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:57,660
Michael Kennedy: So companies are certainly looking for people with those skills.

86
00:09:59,780 --> 00:10:01,820
Michael Kennedy: Let's talk one more thing about the university.

87
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:06,840
Michael Kennedy: Not the AI focus, but just AI.

88
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:55,380
Michael Kennedy: One of the things I think is, of all the places that's getting the most scrambled, changed, under pressure, whatever you call it, from AI, I think it's education in general. And I'm not talking just college. I'm talking, I don't know, like third grade. As soon as the kids can start using AI, they're like, this is like the calculator with a rocket booster on it. You know what I mean? Like this will solve the problems. And I think there's a really big challenge for you as universities to connect with students, keep academic integrity as well. But there's also a huge problem, I think, for the students to not let it undercut their education and end up going, well, all I know I have to do is to do ChatGPT. You're absolutely right. I mean, it's a huge

89
00:10:55,700 --> 00:11:06,560
David Kopec: challenge in computer science education. And I don't think the computer science education community has yet completely figured it out. Well, basically, what it breaks down to is exactly what you said.

90
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:30,400
David Kopec: students are just using ChatGPT or GitHub Copilot to do their homework. And if you're in a first year or second year class, I've been mostly teaching upper level CS for the past like six plus years, and I'm teaching an intro class for the first time in a long time this semester. And it's been eye-opening for me to see how many students are trying to just do every assignment with ChatGPT.

91
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:39,440
David Kopec: And we still have to give them basic assignments. When you're first learning how to do a for loop or what a function is or what an if statement is even, right? You got to write. You can't say

92
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:42,820
Michael Kennedy: implement a database and get back to me next week. You got to start somewhere.

93
00:11:43,440 --> 00:12:41,300
David Kopec: So we still have to teach these fundamentals, but we have this opponent to us in some sense of this ease of access to something that can just do all the work for you. And so I'm sure that, like you mentioned, mathematics educators had similar challenges in the 1970s, 1980s as calculators became prominent. So what I've done, and I've been adjusting as since ChatGPT came out in fall 2022, I've been constantly adjusting and reevaluating, but I have had to go back to the future a little bit. And people might find this a little anachronistic, but I've heard about it from other CS educators as well. Going back to doing some paper exams. I know that sounds crazy. And I know that sounds like bizarre. But at some point, you need to evaluate if students actually know how to write a for loop because you know while we think ll some people think llms are going to replace software engineers in the next two years you still need to understand what it's outputting and i don't think it's i don't i don't know about you michael but i don't think they're completely

94
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:47,480
Speaker 3: replacing software engineers no way no way and that's coming i don't know how many people maybe

95
00:12:47,680 --> 00:13:11,040
Michael Kennedy: don't necessarily i'm a huge fan of agentic coding and and the what it can do for productivity and it's incredibly powerful, but it's, it's one of those things that is, it needs someone to guide it who knows how to, how to do that. And then it becomes a superpower. If you don't, you end up with like, how do we end up on react? I thought this was a rust project. You're like, what happened

96
00:13:11,180 --> 00:14:00,240
David Kopec: here? Yeah. And you need to understand when it makes mistakes, you need to know how to correct those mistakes. And of course you need to be, you need to be understanding everything that it's outputting, so you're auditing it. So we are having a real challenge, especially in those intro classes of how do you kind of force students to not use these tools essentially, because you're not learning anything if the tool writes the for loop for you when you're first learning how to do a for loop. And so you have to find ways to encourage it, to win hearts and minds. I think, of course, that's a big part of it, is convincing students and being dynamic and enthusiastic about how good it feels to really understand how this actually works. But then there has to be enforcement too. And sometimes that feels a little anachronistic being forceful about it or going back to,

97
00:14:00,510 --> 00:14:05,780
Speaker 3: you know, doing tests on paper. But we have to have ways of ensuring the knowledge is actually

98
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:46,440
Michael Kennedy: there. I feel like this is not just a college student issue, but it's I think it's especially relevant in that part of your career that the struggle is not in the way the struggle is often part of part of what's unlocks your thinking it's part of what like cements the knowledge and makes you feel a true sense of accomplishment when you're like i tried this and i couldn't get it to work but three hours later i finally figured it out and i i now understand iterators finally You know what I mean? And it's just so easy to push the easy button and just say, chat, why?

99
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:54,140
David Kopec: And that's what feels good about being a teacher is being there for those aha moments with students.

100
00:14:54,470 --> 00:14:59,180
David Kopec: I had some moments like that last week and they reminded me like, this is why you're in this career.

101
00:15:01,079 --> 00:15:05,500
David Kopec: It's really something that can become addictive to students actually.

102
00:15:05,670 --> 00:15:08,120
Michael Kennedy: When they start having those aha moments, they want more of them.

103
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:09,980
David Kopec: And it spurs on.

104
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:12,080
Michael Kennedy: That's how you end up at like 3 a.m.

105
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:13,500
Michael Kennedy: Really hungry.

106
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:16,140
Michael Kennedy: Wonder why you haven't gone to sleep but still programming.

107
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,720
David Kopec: You're like, this is amazing.

108
00:15:17,780 --> 00:15:18,380
David Kopec: I can't stop.

109
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:19,640
David Kopec: Right, right, right.

110
00:15:19,780 --> 00:15:21,220
David Kopec: And it takes a certain mindset

111
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:24,400
Speaker 3: to be able to appreciate those moments.

112
00:15:26,059 --> 00:15:33,900
David Kopec: And this is like a sidebar, but one thing we're also seeing in computer science education is we see a lot of folks who go into it sometimes for the wrong reasons.

113
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:47,680
David Kopec: Folks sometimes go into computer science just because they hear, this is a great way to get a good job. And if that's your only motivation going into it, you're probably not going to be successful in it. Unfortunately.

114
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:49,880
Michael Kennedy: It's going to be tough. Yeah, it's going to be tough.

115
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:54,960
Michael Kennedy: Yeah. But a lot of people are there for the right reasons. So I think that that's good.

116
00:15:55,620 --> 00:16:10,400
David Kopec: Absolutely. And I hope with a book like this, folks who came in from the other side, folks who came in, you know, because they had that interest, but they didn't have the chance to either go to university, maybe they couldn't afford it, maybe they studied something else and they're later in their career.

117
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:18,680
David Kopec: This will hopefully give them a bunch of those aha moments and about topics that are deeper than just how to write a for loop.

118
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:19,880
Michael Kennedy: Yeah, absolutely.

119
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:22,080
Michael Kennedy: Well, good.

120
00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:32,960
Michael Kennedy: I mean, I feel like there's probably some middle ground you might be able to accomplish if you're like, all right, we're going to give you a laptop, a testing laptop that has no internet.

121
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:35,960
Michael Kennedy: We've gone in there and crushed the network card.

122
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:36,800
Michael Kennedy: Yeah.

123
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:38,040
Michael Kennedy: Here, take the test.

124
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:41,480
Michael Kennedy: And here's your thumb drive to submit your work, you know, potentially.

125
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:42,360
David Kopec: Yeah, yeah.

126
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:43,480
David Kopec: And we do stuff like that.

127
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:47,160
David Kopec: Like I just did a test on, you know, an online test for my students.

128
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:50,400
David Kopec: And I'm just monitoring to make sure nobody's using the tools.

129
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:54,100
David Kopec: You know, but there is something said still for paper exams.

130
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:54,780
David Kopec: I'll tell you why.

131
00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:01,720
David Kopec: Sometimes even today on today's tools for giving exams, sometimes you want students to draw something, especially if it's a data structures and algorithms class.

132
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:05,959
Speaker 3: You might want them to draw a tree and it's just actually easier for them to do that on paper.

133
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:09,160
David Kopec: So when people hear paper, they might be like, oh my goodness, what are you doing that for?

134
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:10,260
David Kopec: No, there's real reasons.

135
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:11,660
Michael Kennedy: Yeah, of course.

136
00:17:11,959 --> 00:17:13,819
David Kopec: But yeah, we have monitoring tools too.

137
00:17:14,620 --> 00:17:15,240
Michael Kennedy: Yeah, very good.

138
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:16,459
Michael Kennedy: All right.

139
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:21,839
Michael Kennedy: Let's maybe take a couple of different examples or different chapters in the book and talk through them.

140
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:30,060
Michael Kennedy: The first one, the first main topic is the smallest possible programming language, right?

141
00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:31,560
David Kopec: Yes, yes.

142
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:32,860
David Kopec: Tell us about this.

143
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:38,800
David Kopec: Yeah, the premise of the chapter is what's the minimum that we need to have a programming language?

144
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:40,640
David Kopec: And there's a famous programming language.

145
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:45,600
David Kopec: I'm actually not going to use the name of the language on the show, I think, just because it has the F word in it.

146
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:47,020
Speaker 3: And I didn't make up the language.

147
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:50,180
David Kopec: It was developed 30 years ago, but we'll just call it BF.

148
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:50,580
David Kopec: Okay.

149
00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:51,100
Michael Kennedy: Yeah.

150
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:53,100
Michael Kennedy: Brain F star.

151
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:54,460
Michael Kennedy: Yeah, sure.

152
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:55,280
Michael Kennedy: Brain F star.

153
00:17:55,940 --> 00:17:59,000
David Kopec: This language, it only has eight symbols in it.

154
00:17:59,060 --> 00:18:01,080
David Kopec: I mean, it literally only has eight symbols in it.

155
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:03,340
David Kopec: Yet, it's what we call Turing complete.

156
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:09,000
David Kopec: And I won't go into the full details of what it means for something to be Turing complete, but let me put it this way.

157
00:18:09,290 --> 00:18:17,060
David Kopec: A language that is Turing complete can theoretically solve any of the same algorithmic problems as any other language that's Turing complete.

158
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:23,620
David Kopec: And every programming language that you use is Turing complete, whether it's Java, Python, C, whatever, of course, they're all Turing complete.

159
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:27,740
David Kopec: This language with only eight symbols in it is also Turing complete.

160
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:40,840
David Kopec: So while you could code something like Quicksort in Python, you could also code it in BF with just eight symbols. While you could code a JSON parser in Python, you could also code a JSON parser in BF.

161
00:18:41,340 --> 00:19:08,980
David Kopec: So by learning this really, really basic language and actually implementing it, so implementing an interpreter for it, something that can actually run programs written in it, you really get to understand just how little we need to solve computational problems. We don't need much. We need very minimum amount of computing machinery and very minimum amount of syntax to be able to solve most problems. Now, would you want to solve most problems in PF? Of course not.

162
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:28,180
David Kopec: We just use it as an illustrative example to show this is how simple a programming language can really be and still have all the same capabilities as a more advanced programming language. And you might wonder then why do we have such much more advanced programming languages? Because they give us a lot more developer productivity. They have more abstractions that let us think as human beings

163
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:34,500
Speaker 3: instead of thinking like machines. The expressiveness, absolutely. And so that's great that we have all

164
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:39,280
David Kopec: of that. But if you really want to understand essentially what the language is doing at the

165
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:52,679
Michael Kennedy: lowest levels, you only need these few bits. So what's the key message here? Obviously, you're not trying to get people to become BF experts, right? I mean, maybe you learn Cobalt

166
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:58,080
Speaker 3: over bf these days still work for the social security administration yeah yes exactly there's

167
00:19:58,140 --> 00:20:12,800
Michael Kennedy: going to be some high-paying cobalt jobs out there um but this is more about like writing an actual interpreter very much like c python itself in a sense conceptually right conceptually i mean much

168
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:19,640
David Kopec: much much simpler and actually in the next chapter we get to writing a basic interpreter which is like just one step up from BF.

169
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:21,620
David Kopec: And we can talk about that in a minute.

170
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:26,100
Speaker 3: But yeah, it's about understanding how it works at a low level.

171
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:27,440
David Kopec: What's it actually doing?

172
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:30,240
David Kopec: And it feels good to make something that can run programs.

173
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:36,440
David Kopec: A lot of people, when they get into computer science, are actually excited about making their own language.

174
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:40,920
David Kopec: So by doing these first couple chapters of the book, you're actually on the path to that.

175
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:49,720
David Kopec: I think after reading these first two chapters, you could go implement your own simple language and really make that kind of dream that a lot of us have come true.

176
00:20:50,330 --> 00:20:52,020
David Kopec: So it's about understanding how it works at a low level.

177
00:20:52,180 --> 00:20:54,780
David Kopec: I have to say the book is not a practical book.

178
00:20:54,900 --> 00:21:01,980
David Kopec: It's not like talk Python in production where you're going to learn, you know, here's some useful tools and tips and strategies.

179
00:21:02,370 --> 00:21:05,600
Michael Kennedy: Install this thing and set up that config and then run it this way.

180
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:06,360
Michael Kennedy: Right.

181
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:10,760
David Kopec: Computer Science from Scratch is not going to help you build your next app that you're building.

182
00:21:11,430 --> 00:21:12,040
Speaker 3: Not directly.

183
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:25,500
David Kopec: Not directly, but it is going to help you understand a lot more about what's happening under the covers, which is ultimately going to make you think more broadly as a software developer and understand different strategies that you might be able to use.

184
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:27,400
David Kopec: I'll give you an example with this interpreter stuff.

185
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:36,220
David Kopec: You might be writing a program that needs to have some kind of configuration files, and you want to maybe be able to parse those configuration files.

186
00:21:36,820 --> 00:22:14,780
David Kopec: Well, part of writing an interpreter is writing a parser, something that understands the syntax of the programming languages and starts to get towards the semantics. And you might want to be able to write a parser later on for some very specific configuration type format that you've come up with for some, or maybe even just a file format for more of like an office type program. And you're going to need some way of understanding the techniques of how to parse that. Learning how an interpreter works will help you write that program later on. So it's about learning computational techniques, learning problem solving techniques more than it is about like something that's going to necessarily be, this is exactly how you do this for the next app you're going to build.

187
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:31,880
Michael Kennedy: It's not something that you would just stumble across most of the time, I think, right? You'll stumble across, oh, here's a web framework. You'll stumble across, you know, oh, here's an ML library or something, but you don't typically stumble across and here's how you build a parser from

188
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:43,860
David Kopec: scratch. Right. And so, you know, there has to be that curiosity there. So I will admit that if you have no interest and you're not the type of person who wants to understand how things work, you won't like this book.

189
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,640
David Kopec: And that is some folks and that's okay.

190
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:52,760
David Kopec: There's folks who go into programming because they're only interested in what they can build and they're not so interested in how things work.

191
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:55,940
David Kopec: And if that's you, this is probably not the book for you.

192
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:58,200
Speaker 3: But if you're the type of person who has that curiosity

193
00:22:58,460 --> 00:23:03,600
David Kopec: and you really wanna understand how everything's actually working under the covers, then this is a great book.

194
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:05,060
Michael Kennedy: Yeah, absolutely.

195
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:18,580
Michael Kennedy: And it's a simple enough thing that you can grasp the ideas pretty quickly with this BF language, right? It's not so complicated that you, you know, a day later are still trying to make the thing parse.

196
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:32,480
David Kopec: Absolutely. I mean, what's crazy is to interpret BF, you only need about 30 lines of code, 30 lines of Python. And then you actually have something that can run any program written in this language.

197
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:38,820
Michael Kennedy: And to be clear, you have like something.bf files that you can put the language into.

198
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:42,820
Michael Kennedy: And then you say Python, this module, that file.

199
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:47,260
Michael Kennedy: And it'll run it as if it were an interpreter for that thing, right?

200
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:48,240
David Kopec: Exactly.

201
00:23:48,420 --> 00:23:48,600
David Kopec: Yeah.

202
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:51,780
David Kopec: You're literally implementing the whole programming language in like 30 lines of Python.

203
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:57,120
David Kopec: And I think what's great about this too is it takes away the feeling that everything is magic.

204
00:23:57,740 --> 00:24:02,800
David Kopec: You know, that's another thing I love when people read also classic computer science problems in Python.

205
00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:10,480
David Kopec: You know, sometimes when you think about how these things work, like in that book, we cover the A star algorithm, which is something that Google Maps work, right?

206
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:10,980
David Kopec: Uses.

207
00:24:11,350 --> 00:24:15,100
David Kopec: When you think about Google Maps, like it feels like magic when you use it.

208
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:20,360
David Kopec: It just, but actually there's really understandable, logical algorithms that are underneath the surface.

209
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:21,620
David Kopec: It's the same thing here.

210
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:24,120
David Kopec: Python itself might feel like magic to a lot of folks.

211
00:24:24,470 --> 00:24:31,600
David Kopec: But by the time you get through these first couple of chapters, especially through the basic interpreter chapter, you'll start to be on the road to think, oh, you know what?

212
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:37,420
David Kopec: I bet I could dive into the CPython source code with enough additional training and really understand it.

213
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:39,120
David Kopec: It gives you that confidence that this is not just magic.

214
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:40,280
Michael Kennedy: We've already got the parser.

215
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:44,720
Michael Kennedy: You just got to look at the bytecodes and look at it go.

216
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:49,780
David Kopec: Not to say there's not a lot more there, but it just gets you on that journey and makes you see it's not magic.

217
00:24:50,380 --> 00:24:50,500
Michael Kennedy: Right.

218
00:24:50,820 --> 00:24:54,920
Michael Kennedy: Well, it's that zero to one sort of gap that's the hardest to cross.

219
00:24:55,740 --> 00:24:55,980
David Kopec: Yeah.

220
00:24:56,539 --> 00:24:56,940
Michael Kennedy: Yeah.

221
00:24:57,580 --> 00:25:19,240
Michael Kennedy: you know, like the second language with sync, second programming language you learn, or the third or the fourth, they only get easier to learn, not harder to learn. Whereas, you know, maybe when you're first starting out, and you're trying to get something to compile, and it won't even run, you're like, Oh, my God, how am I going to do I can't even learn this one, there's all these things I'm going to have to know. And it's really kind of upside down.

222
00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:32,600
David Kopec: Yeah, absolutely. And so, you know, when we think about understanding how Python itself works, I think the second chapter of the book about basic gets us a lot further along on that journey because here this isn't just a made up.

223
00:25:33,180 --> 00:25:40,000
David Kopec: BF is it's a language that's been around in computer science education for like 30 years, but it's not a real language that people actually used.

224
00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:45,300
Michael Kennedy: Very few people ever said that they were BF programmers at a dinner party, right?

225
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:46,140
David Kopec: Absolutely.

226
00:25:46,750 --> 00:25:48,940
David Kopec: But plenty of people said they were basic programmers.

227
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:54,000
David Kopec: And it was the first programming language of a lot of people who grew up in the 70s, 80s, or even the 90s.

228
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,220
David Kopec: It was my first programming language.

229
00:25:55,740 --> 00:26:00,460
David Kopec: And there was a dialect of BASIC called Tiny BASIC that came out in the late 1970s.

230
00:26:00,620 --> 00:26:03,360
David Kopec: It was actually one of the first free software projects.

231
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:09,320
David Kopec: And it would run on machines that just had two or four kilobytes of RAM.

232
00:26:09,940 --> 00:26:12,080
David Kopec: So that's why it was called Tiny BASIC.

233
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:13,320
David Kopec: I mean, it truly was tiny.

234
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:17,220
David Kopec: And so we re-implemented dialect of Tiny BASIC in Chapter 2.

235
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:25,320
David Kopec: So this is re-implementing a real programming language that people actually used for real work in the late 1970s and up to the early 1980s.

236
00:26:25,940 --> 00:26:28,300
David Kopec: and it can run real programs from that period.

237
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:30,900
David Kopec: So you could go download a program from the late 70s.

238
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:34,180
David Kopec: We were missing like one or two features from the real language.

239
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:36,620
David Kopec: But if you have a program, not all programs use all those features.

240
00:26:37,180 --> 00:26:38,560
David Kopec: You could actually run it in this interpreter.

241
00:26:38,780 --> 00:26:44,780
David Kopec: So we go from the first language where it's really esoteric, educational, you know, weird language to the second chapter.

242
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:45,780
David Kopec: This was a real thing.

243
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:47,780
Michael Kennedy: Yeah, absolutely it was.

244
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:50,680
Michael Kennedy: You know, I'm just going to give a little shout out to Visual Basic.

245
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:51,860
David Kopec: Yeah.

246
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:53,900
Michael Kennedy: I don't know if you, did you ever do Visual Basic?

247
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:57,140
David Kopec: I did, and I did a version on the Mac called Real Basic.

248
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:59,240
David Kopec: So this is really esoteric.

249
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:02,300
David Kopec: But anyone who used Real Basic late 90s, I'm in your camp.

250
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:03,320
Michael Kennedy: There you go.

251
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:12,340
Michael Kennedy: I don't know if we even today still have something as approachable and productive as Visual Basic was.

252
00:27:12,740 --> 00:27:14,780
Michael Kennedy: For people who haven't used it, you're like, there's just no way.

253
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:16,000
Michael Kennedy: There's no way that this basic.

254
00:27:16,580 --> 00:27:18,120
Michael Kennedy: But you would just get a visual thing.

255
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:23,080
Michael Kennedy: You would drag it together to build your, you know, here I want to have, literally you would drag over.

256
00:27:23,260 --> 00:27:24,120
Michael Kennedy: Here's a web browser.

257
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:51,159
Michael Kennedy: here's the address bar here's a go button and then you would you could double click the go button and we'd create an event handler and then you would go web browser dot go to text dot value or whatever i mean that was literally you could do it in five minutes you could like create something that is a functional web browser without much it was incredible and so yeah i just thinking back to a few things i built with it was amazing you know michael a lot of people agree with you there's a lot of articles

258
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:54,940
David Kopec: that I've seen on blogs and stuff where people reminisce about Visual Basic.

259
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:56,560
David Kopec: And I agree.

260
00:27:56,700 --> 00:28:00,540
David Kopec: I mean, for desktop app development, it was incredibly productive.

261
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:06,140
David Kopec: I mean, I think it still rivals some of the tools we have for building web apps today.

262
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:08,720
David Kopec: When you think about how easy it was to lay out a user interface.

263
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:24,540
David Kopec: And for designers, it was great too, because designers didn't need to know how to code and they could lay out the interface in the same way that it would really appear in the program, which is different from how designers work today, where they'll often do mock-ups and the developer will have to take the mock-up and turn it into code.

264
00:28:25,220 --> 00:28:33,240
David Kopec: And so you kind of lose something there with the designer being able to have the final product in front of them as they're changing around how things look.

265
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:37,400
David Kopec: So there were elements of it that were still missing today, I think.

266
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:40,360
Michael Kennedy: Yeah, I think it really hasn't been matched.

267
00:28:40,420 --> 00:28:46,820
Michael Kennedy: You know, Windows forms from.NET kind of approached that, but it was still itself was also a little bit more complicated.

268
00:28:47,020 --> 00:28:49,100
Michael Kennedy: Just there was something special about that.

269
00:28:49,680 --> 00:29:01,340
Michael Kennedy: And now, don't get me wrong, it's not like I'm saying we should just go back to it, because the software we build is way more advanced, does a lot of other things, but there's just that lower area is just kind of missing.

270
00:29:01,510 --> 00:29:05,020
Michael Kennedy: And I want to talk, sort of transition from that to something else, really.

271
00:29:05,430 --> 00:29:09,520
Michael Kennedy: We're looking at these two examples of the BF language interpreter and the basic interpreter.

272
00:29:11,860 --> 00:29:17,880
Michael Kennedy: I hear that to really understand computer science, really to work on these things, I have to.

273
00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:19,440
Michael Kennedy: It's not preferable.

274
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:23,400
Michael Kennedy: I have to do a language with pointers, malloc, free.

275
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:24,900
Michael Kennedy: I've got to.

276
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:27,340
Michael Kennedy: I've got to work at that level, or I just won't understand anything.

277
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:30,580
Michael Kennedy: In Python, we don't really have those concepts.

278
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:37,480
Michael Kennedy: And the irony, I think, is Python has more pointers than C++ because there's no stack at all, not at all, really.

279
00:29:37,570 --> 00:29:39,900
Michael Kennedy: I mean, in the interpreter there is, but not in your writing.

280
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:42,080
Michael Kennedy: Even a number one is just a pointer.

281
00:29:44,460 --> 00:29:47,920
Michael Kennedy: So Python's full of pointers, but not in the way that computer science thinks about it.

282
00:29:48,420 --> 00:29:51,500
Michael Kennedy: What are your thoughts about that sort of tension, right?

283
00:29:51,530 --> 00:30:02,560
Michael Kennedy: On one hand, you have this really understandable language talking about these ideas, but the computer is calling malloc on a page of memory and that's what's happening and they're not seeing it.

284
00:30:03,159 --> 00:30:06,600
David Kopec: Okay, so let me talk about it from a pedagogy standpoint.

285
00:30:07,060 --> 00:30:09,720
Michael Kennedy: So at my last institution, Champlain College,

286
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:11,920
David Kopec: we had a big debate over my nine years there.

287
00:30:12,010 --> 00:30:15,740
David Kopec: Should we do our first three classes in Python or in C++?

288
00:30:16,540 --> 00:30:19,120
David Kopec: And when I came in, the first three classes were in C++.

289
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:22,820
David Kopec: And we actually decided over the years to keep it there for exactly what you mentioned.

290
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:32,900
David Kopec: We wanted to give students both that high-level experience with object-oriented programming, but we also wanted them to have experience with pointers, with memory management, and understand how things work at a low level.

291
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:39,560
David Kopec: But in that same period of time, many schools have moved to Python because of the other thing we talked about, which is accessibility.

292
00:30:40,860 --> 00:30:45,260
David Kopec: I think Python simply is an easier language to learn than C++.

293
00:30:45,780 --> 00:30:49,240
David Kopec: I don't think that most people who know both languages would really debate that.

294
00:30:50,060 --> 00:30:59,940
David Kopec: And so if we're trying to make those first ramp up classes where you're first learning CS as easy as possible, I think Python is the way to go if we want to encourage more people into

295
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:05,280
Speaker 3: the discipline. That doesn't mean there shouldn't be a C or C++ course later on, where folks,

296
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:17,060
David Kopec: maybe when they take operating systems or even as part of an architecture class to see how the assembly language matches to a C program, that kind of thing. It doesn't mean there shouldn't be C or C++ in the curriculum or Rust or whatever.

297
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:24,320
David Kopec: But if we're thinking about what's best for a student who's just coming into the field, I think we need to think about accessibility.

298
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:31,520
David Kopec: But at the same time, my advice to all students is learn one language well before you learn any other language.

299
00:31:32,020 --> 00:31:33,480
David Kopec: So whether you're starting with Python

300
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:34,760
Speaker 3: or you're starting with C++,

301
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:42,600
David Kopec: spend a year or two on it and become really decent at it before you go and learn another language.

302
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:45,960
David Kopec: And that's the biggest mistake I see folks who are self-taught make.

303
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:50,560
David Kopec: The biggest mistake I see folks who are self-taught make is constantly switch around from language to language.

304
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:51,960
Michael Kennedy: I need to know this.

305
00:31:52,220 --> 00:31:52,880
Michael Kennedy: Okay, I got it.

306
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,100
Michael Kennedy: Now it's time to learn this.

307
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:56,640
Michael Kennedy: And they're trying to fill all these gaps, right?

308
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:57,420
David Kopec: Right, right.

309
00:31:57,660 --> 00:32:02,200
David Kopec: Because once you learn Python well, a lot of the stuff in C or C++ will make sense to you.

310
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:06,580
David Kopec: The pointers might not, but a lot of the other stuff, like how does a function work?

311
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:07,360
David Kopec: How does a loop work?

312
00:32:07,780 --> 00:32:08,560
David Kopec: What are variables?

313
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:10,160
David Kopec: What's a global versus local?

314
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:10,880
David Kopec: All that kind of stuff.

315
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:12,700
David Kopec: That's going to make sense to you.

316
00:32:12,780 --> 00:32:18,160
David Kopec: And that's going to be transferable skills once you've really learned it in any one language across any other language.

317
00:32:18,270 --> 00:32:19,920
David Kopec: And then pointers you can learn later on.

318
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:22,900
David Kopec: You don't need to learn that at the beginning of your CS education.

319
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:26,660
David Kopec: It's not people make it sound like it's a totally mystical topic.

320
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:34,520
David Kopec: If you are able to do calculus, which basically every CS degree requires calculus one, you can learn pointers.

321
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:37,040
Michael Kennedy: You'll be OK. You can learn pointers.

322
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:41,880
Michael Kennedy: Yeah, exactly. Like double integrals and all that kind of stuff is way worse.

323
00:32:43,820 --> 00:33:13,740
Michael Kennedy: I feel like you could also cycle right so you could start with Python for a couple of classes then go deeper closer to the machine with C but then you could come back and say let's look at Python again with new eyes and try to understand interpreted dynamic languages better because now you know you can take the red pill and you can see the arenas and the blocks of the memory allocator and the GC and all that kind of stuff, right?

324
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:16,440
Michael Kennedy: You could go, actually, you didn't know any of this stuff.

325
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:19,420
Michael Kennedy: You didn't, nobody probably even thought to think, is this here?

326
00:33:20,580 --> 00:33:24,880
Michael Kennedy: And yet look at what's underneath that you're taking, you're building on top of, right?

327
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:28,400
David Kopec: Yeah, and also remember how long an academic semester is.

328
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:29,360
David Kopec: It's 15 weeks.

329
00:33:29,820 --> 00:33:34,440
David Kopec: So if you're taking a class in college, you're forced to be doing that same language for 15 weeks.

330
00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:39,320
David Kopec: That's really the challenge for self-taught folks is they could just spend two days on one, two days on another, right?

331
00:33:39,540 --> 00:33:40,200
Michael Kennedy: But absolutely, you're right.

332
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:43,520
David Kopec: Once you've had enough time in one, you can cycle to the others back and forth.

333
00:33:44,130 --> 00:33:44,540
Michael Kennedy: Yeah, fine.

334
00:33:46,360 --> 00:34:01,860
Michael Kennedy: I personally am a fan of it being in Python because I feel like one of the biggest challenges to keeping people in computer science and programming is that they don't get enough early wins and early like, yes, aha, right?

335
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:07,400
Michael Kennedy: It's like, okay, in week 12, we'll let you write a program, but we're going to talk pointers for a while.

336
00:34:07,950 --> 00:34:09,879
Michael Kennedy: And then you'll finally get to make some, you know what I mean?

337
00:34:10,020 --> 00:34:15,860
Michael Kennedy: Like it's just so delayed and that's fine for certain people, but there's a lot of people are like, oh, forget this.

338
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:17,960
David Kopec: This is not what I thought I'm out.

339
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:21,919
David Kopec: And a huge part of that is the Python library ecosystem.

340
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:28,840
David Kopec: How easy it is to drop PI game into an intro class and get somebody building a really simple game.

341
00:34:29,919 --> 00:34:37,399
David Kopec: You know, it's much harder in C or C++ to start integrating libraries and start having students understand how to use those libraries.

342
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:43,179
David Kopec: And it usually requires a lot more knowledge buildup to be able to use pointers and stuff with those libraries.

343
00:34:43,610 --> 00:34:45,419
David Kopec: So Python just makes everything more accessible.

344
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:46,520
Michael Kennedy: Awesome.

345
00:34:47,919 --> 00:34:48,020
Michael Kennedy: Cool.

346
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:48,600
Michael Kennedy: All right.

347
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:59,520
Michael Kennedy: The next area that was pretty interesting and a little bit, maybe a little artsy, is the computational art.

348
00:34:59,620 --> 00:35:00,260
Michael Kennedy: Tell us about that.

349
00:35:01,180 --> 00:35:01,340
David Kopec: Yeah.

350
00:35:01,410 --> 00:35:04,360
David Kopec: So there's two chapters in the book on computational art.

351
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:08,880
David Kopec: The first one is really starting to understand what a pixel is on the screen.

352
00:35:09,260 --> 00:35:19,360
David Kopec: And the way we do that is we take modern photos and then we want to display them on like an ancient Mac, a Mac from the 1980s, like the Mac Plus.

353
00:35:20,220 --> 00:35:31,120
David Kopec: And so we're going to take that modern photo and use what's called a dithering algorithm to break it down into patterns of black and white pixels, because those early Macs were only black and white.

354
00:35:31,180 --> 00:35:35,740
David Kopec: that will then still kind of look like the photo in black and white with these specialized patterns.

355
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:38,420
David Kopec: So you're learning a bunch of things by doing this.

356
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:40,780
David Kopec: One thing you're learning is you're learning really what is a pixel.

357
00:35:41,020 --> 00:35:43,240
David Kopec: And a pixel is really pretty simple at its base.

358
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:45,060
David Kopec: I mean, it's just a color and a location.

359
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:48,360
David Kopec: And so understanding how those pixels are organized.

360
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:55,480
David Kopec: And really, they're just organized usually as an array or, you know, as a list in Python or a numpy array or whatever.

361
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:59,200
David Kopec: And then we're understanding some algorithmic stuff.

362
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:03,020
David Kopec: So understanding that dithering algorithm is giving us some algorithmic practice.

363
00:36:03,580 --> 00:36:11,280
David Kopec: And then a cool thing we do at the end is we actually convert it into a file format called Mac Paint for displaying on, you know, an ancient Mac.

364
00:36:11,660 --> 00:36:17,640
David Kopec: And that Mac Paint format uses a very simple compression scheme called run length encoding.

365
00:36:18,140 --> 00:36:23,480
David Kopec: So we're getting some other kind of algorithmic practice in there as well, understanding a simple compression algorithm.

366
00:36:23,860 --> 00:36:29,680
David Kopec: And we're understanding something about file formats too, which is really kind of an interesting CS topic as well.

367
00:36:29,780 --> 00:36:30,540
Speaker 3: Yeah, it sure is, yeah.

368
00:36:30,810 --> 00:36:35,420
David Kopec: Because we have to properly format the file so the Mac Paint program on the ancient Mac will open it correctly.

369
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:44,360
Michael Kennedy: Yeah, that was something actually when I first got into programming, I feel like I just stuck with text-oriented files pretty much as long as I could.

370
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:58,180
Michael Kennedy: Because looking at a binary file, it has a header and we read the first few bytes and then the value of that byte tells you how long the rest of the header is and then like what this means and then you skip.

371
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:03,100
Michael Kennedy: And I don't know, that was just, it was a bridge too far for me in my early programming days.

372
00:37:03,860 --> 00:37:04,980
Michael Kennedy: And I was like, wow, this is intense.

373
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:08,560
Michael Kennedy: And I was in awe of people like, yeah, we just read the header and we do this.

374
00:37:08,620 --> 00:37:11,480
Michael Kennedy: I'm like, okay, if you say so.

375
00:37:12,740 --> 00:37:16,280
David Kopec: You know, it's a classic CS trade-off between time and space.

376
00:37:16,820 --> 00:37:19,720
David Kopec: Anything that we do in a binary file, we could do in a text file.

377
00:37:20,660 --> 00:37:28,300
David Kopec: But binary files can be more efficient because they can be more compact and they can be faster to read from for certain kinds of data.

378
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:37,580
David Kopec: So, you know, it's not that we have to use binary files, but understanding what a binary file format is like can be eye opening to some readers.

379
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:42,380
Speaker 3: And if you think about like modern file formats, of course, text formats are much more explainable.

380
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:49,780
David Kopec: Right. That's why we have the rise of things like XML in the late 90s up to today or even JSON as a data change data interchange format.

381
00:37:50,020 --> 00:37:56,540
David Kopec: There's alternatives to JSON, of course, that are much more efficient for coding your web app and for distributing the data back and forth.

382
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:58,260
Speaker 3: But JSON is human readable.

383
00:37:59,160 --> 00:37:59,640
Speaker 3: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

384
00:38:00,190 --> 00:38:01,280
David Kopec: But JSON is human readable.

385
00:38:01,530 --> 00:38:06,740
David Kopec: So we can right away understand what it's supposed to represent and debug it really well.

386
00:38:07,290 --> 00:38:09,180
David Kopec: And so it's one of those classic tradeoffs.

387
00:38:09,230 --> 00:38:18,380
David Kopec: We can have something more efficient or we can have something that might take up a little bit more time, but actually is better for us as human beings.

388
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:19,280
Michael Kennedy: Yeah.

389
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:33,400
Michael Kennedy: it's just, I think it's a good skill. And also something that was prevalent throughout the book is juggling bits, bits and bytes, not just juggling bytes, but bits and bit flipping and shifting.

390
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:39,100
Michael Kennedy: And there's a lot of that going on, especially in the emulator layers and stuff like that.

391
00:38:39,860 --> 00:38:49,480
David Kopec: Yeah. And even in the Mac paint chapter, because the way Mac paint stores pixels is as individual bits. So you have like a one or a zero representing a black or a white pixel on the screen.

392
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:56,600
David Kopec: And so you have to find a way to take those bits and compact them into bytes and then run the right run length encoding algorithm to compress it.

393
00:38:56,720 --> 00:39:03,060
David Kopec: It's yeah, but there's a lot of that. And, you know, when you do really low level work in computing, you need to understand bits and bytes.

394
00:39:03,740 --> 00:39:11,820
David Kopec: If you're going to if you're going to work on device drivers or operating systems or file formats, you really need to understand this stuff at an intimate level.

395
00:39:11,900 --> 00:39:23,000
David Kopec: So we try to make fun, you know, projects in the book that you get something, you know, that's interesting as a way of making this, you know, a little of sugar to help the medicine go down kind of thing.

396
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:26,340
Speaker 3: And I also, we were talking about the computer graphics chapters.

397
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:30,940
David Kopec: I also wanted to mention chapter four because I love the program in that called Impressionist.

398
00:39:31,460 --> 00:39:37,640
David Kopec: It makes images that look like an Impressionist painter painted a photograph.

399
00:39:38,220 --> 00:39:42,760
Speaker 3: So you give it a photograph and then it builds kind of abstract art out of that photograph.

400
00:39:42,970 --> 00:39:48,320
David Kopec: And people usually think you need a neural network for that or you need some kind of really advanced machine learning algorithm for that.

401
00:39:49,060 --> 00:39:53,180
David Kopec: But actually, we show in the chapter that you can do it using a pretty simple algorithm.

402
00:39:53,360 --> 00:40:05,020
David Kopec: All the algorithm does is it puts a vector shape on the screen and it tries to position the vector shape so that it overlaps a region of color on the original photo that is close to the color in the vector shape.

403
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:12,040
David Kopec: And if you keep doing that and you put enough vector shapes on the screen, you start to have like abstract shapes that look like the original photo.

404
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:21,000
David Kopec: And so I think that's that chapter is kind of powerful because it shows you how a simple technique, a simple computational technique can really have some pretty powerful output.

405
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:24,960
Michael Kennedy: Yeah, it's a really interesting idea and it comes out looking great.

406
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:33,420
Michael Kennedy: It's sort of it's approaching the problem from a different perspective, which I suspect is probably a pretty interesting CS lesson.

407
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:40,580
Michael Kennedy: You know, there's these problems that are incredibly expensive and difficult to compute the one true answer.

408
00:40:41,460 --> 00:40:45,920
Michael Kennedy: But then there's amazingly fast ways to get a, that's pretty much it, answer.

409
00:40:46,380 --> 00:40:49,000
Michael Kennedy: I'm thinking like Monte Carlo simulations and stuff like that.

410
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:52,000
Michael Kennedy: You're like, this could take two weeks or three milliseconds.

411
00:40:52,300 --> 00:40:53,020
Michael Kennedy: Which would you prefer?

412
00:40:53,420 --> 00:40:54,820
David Kopec: You know, you're pretty much going to get the same answer.

413
00:40:55,580 --> 00:40:55,700
David Kopec: Yeah.

414
00:40:56,540 --> 00:41:00,080
David Kopec: And, you know, we talked about like why is the book in Python?

415
00:41:00,660 --> 00:41:08,360
David Kopec: And, you know, that is one of the challenges of writing the book in Python is simply Python doesn't have great performance when you write in pure Python.

416
00:41:09,340 --> 00:41:16,120
David Kopec: And so, you know, we've all seen the benchmarks where Python's like 50 or 70 times slower than C on certain benchmarks.

417
00:41:16,430 --> 00:41:46,920
David Kopec: Right. And yeah, honestly, for some of the programs in this book, you really see that performance deficit you have with Python, like the abstract art chapter, where if I wrote that same program in C using some C graphics library instead of in Python with Pillow, even though Pillow, I think, is mostly implemented in C anyway, but still just with the overhead of having our algorithmic part of it in Python, that program is probably 30, 50 times slower than it would be in C. So you have to wait like 20 minutes to see that abstract

418
00:41:47,340 --> 00:42:10,160
Michael Kennedy: art that would have been like less than a minute in a C program. Not that it's relevant to the book or the courses, but you probably could bring in some optimizations like Cython or Numba, a couple of the things that'll take just the inner two loops and just make them go different,

419
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:29,740
David Kopec: but it's not the point of the book. That's true. And so I put that as an exercise for the reader in the NES emulator chapter, because the NES emulator chapter, where we actually build up a real NES emulator. So this, I didn't write in the book for legal reasons, but it can actually play Donkey Kong. So it can play Donkey Kong from the original Nintendo Entertainment System.

420
00:42:29,820 --> 00:42:33,420
Michael Kennedy: Let's talk about the NES, the Nintendo Entertainment System.

421
00:42:33,900 --> 00:42:54,700
David Kopec: Yeah. So, I mean, the NES, a lot of us remember growing up with, and if you're of a younger generation, this was like the main video game system of the 1980s to early 1990s that everyone had. It's where the original Super Mario came out, the original Legend of Zelda. And, you know, it's actually, of course, like all video game systems, it's a computer. And being a video game

422
00:42:54,880 --> 00:43:00,080
Speaker 3: system from the 1980s, it's a pretty simple computer, actually. It has a 6502 microprocessor,

423
00:43:00,540 --> 00:43:15,120
David Kopec: which is the same microprocessor that was in the Apple II or the Commodore 64 or the TRS, I think the TRS-80 also. And that microprocessor, it only has 56 instructions, the NES version of it.

424
00:43:15,740 --> 00:43:30,220
David Kopec: And so you can write an interpreter for that microprocessor pretty compactly, not quite as compact as the BF interpreter in chapter one, but compactly enough that it's only a few hundred lines of Python to be able to really write a simulator of that CPU.

425
00:43:30,980 --> 00:43:38,400
David Kopec: And so the NES is just that CPU plus a graphics processor called the picture processing unit, plus an audio processor.

426
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:41,580
David Kopec: So in the chapter, we implement the full CPU.

427
00:43:42,260 --> 00:43:49,040
David Kopec: We implement a simplified version of the PPU, not advanced enough to run Super Mario Brothers, but it is advanced enough to run Donkey Kong.

428
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:52,200
David Kopec: And we don't implement the APU.

429
00:43:52,250 --> 00:43:55,760
David Kopec: So the audio processing unit's a little more complicated and we don't do the audio.

430
00:43:56,310 --> 00:43:59,260
David Kopec: But we do all of this in the chapter so you can run real NES games.

431
00:44:00,040 --> 00:44:03,340
David Kopec: And what you're getting is you're getting to understand that software hardware interface.

432
00:44:03,570 --> 00:44:13,560
David Kopec: You're starting to understand like, how does our software actually get run on hardware by re-implementing what a CPU actually does?

433
00:44:13,980 --> 00:44:15,540
David Kopec: And you're re-implementing the memory map too.

434
00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:17,340
David Kopec: So how does the CPU connect to memory?

435
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:19,760
David Kopec: How does the CPU connect to the graphics processor?

436
00:44:20,540 --> 00:44:22,340
David Kopec: You're doing all of that in that chapter.

437
00:44:23,100 --> 00:44:33,980
Michael Kennedy: And so it's kind of like- Yeah, so before you talked about like writing an interpreter for the BF in basic languages, here you're completely emulating the hardware.

438
00:44:35,120 --> 00:44:43,860
Michael Kennedy: of the NES and you're giving it the potentially given it open source NES games and it can run them,

439
00:44:44,020 --> 00:45:38,060
David Kopec: right? Correct. Yeah. It runs several NES open source games. Like I said, I didn't put it for legal reasons, but it can run real commercial games as well for the NES. And so you're doing the whole soup to nuts, like entire system, except the audio, but it is Python and it's pure Python, except for, of course, the library we're using. And we're using,  Pygame for, for displaying the window, which is written a lot of it in C. But because it's pure Python, the emulator doesn't run at full speed. So it runs on my Mac. It runs at about 15 frames per second. The real NES ran at 60 frames per second. So we leave as an exercise to the reader. Yeah, go use Cython or something like that. And I'm sure you can get this up with several different techniques. Definitely with Cython, but with several different techniques, you could get this up to 60 frames per second, but you're going to have to incorporate something that gets outside of just pure Python.

440
00:45:38,500 --> 00:45:38,920
Michael Kennedy: Sure.

441
00:45:41,620 --> 00:45:50,300
Michael Kennedy: There's a bunch of ways that you already mentioned, but one new way that's kind of officially new just this month is free-threaded Python.

442
00:45:51,720 --> 00:45:58,620
Michael Kennedy: And I went back to my async programming course where there's a lot of examples of like, let's do this synchronously.

443
00:45:58,760 --> 00:45:59,860
Michael Kennedy: Now let's do it with threads.

444
00:46:00,040 --> 00:46:39,320
Michael Kennedy: let's do it with multiprocessing now let's do it with async io right and see like how those all compare and the threads one anything was computational it's like yeah it's the same speed or maybe even slower right but then i ran it with i did uv run --python 3.14 t and it went 10 times faster or eight times faster or on my 10 core machine and it's literally just running on the i didn't change the codes from pre free threaded python and it just took off So I'm thinking here, there's graphics amongst many things is primed for this embarrassingly parallel processing.

445
00:46:40,260 --> 00:46:45,180
Michael Kennedy: You could break up the screen into little chunks and go, well, we got 10 chunks and 10 cores.

446
00:46:45,960 --> 00:46:46,320
Michael Kennedy: Let's go at it.

447
00:46:47,100 --> 00:46:49,320
David Kopec: What do you think about it as a plausibility?

448
00:46:50,120 --> 00:46:56,880
David Kopec: Unfortunately, for a lot of emulators, especially emulators that are for more modern systems, threading would be a huge advantage.

449
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:00,960
David Kopec: For the NES, it's not because of the way that everything was timed.

450
00:47:01,840 --> 00:47:11,100
David Kopec: So every time that the CPU does one cycle, the PPU, the picture processing unit, has to be timed to do exactly three cycles.

451
00:47:11,800 --> 00:47:16,060
David Kopec: So you can't just go ahead and, you know, you don't just give it work.

452
00:47:16,140 --> 00:47:18,780
David Kopec: It's not like a modern GPU where you just give it a bunch of chunks of work.

453
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:21,640
David Kopec: It works on its own and then provides that to the screen.

454
00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:24,080
David Kopec: It's completely synchronized to the CPU.

455
00:47:24,680 --> 00:47:26,580
Speaker 3: And so is the audio processing unit, too.

456
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:29,480
Michael Kennedy: So it all has to kind of be synchronized within a single thread.

457
00:47:29,710 --> 00:47:32,340
Michael Kennedy: And all the games assume that that's how it works, right?

458
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:33,480
Michael Kennedy: That's how they have it all set.

459
00:47:33,570 --> 00:47:33,680
Michael Kennedy: Yeah.

460
00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:34,380
David Kopec: Yeah.

461
00:47:34,490 --> 00:47:34,580
David Kopec: Yeah.

462
00:47:34,650 --> 00:47:43,740
David Kopec: And what they had, what was called a V blank period, which was a period where it had already drawn the screen and then it actually tells the CPU, hey, I'm done drawing the screen.

463
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:47,480
David Kopec: Now you can do all kinds of work and be ready for the next time that you draw the next frame again.

464
00:47:48,380 --> 00:47:52,000
David Kopec: So they had really tight synchronization between the graphics and the CPU.

465
00:47:53,160 --> 00:47:53,380
Michael Kennedy: Interesting.

466
00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:55,660
Michael Kennedy: Still cool.

467
00:47:56,420 --> 00:48:05,060
Michael Kennedy: Still pretty cool. There's a lot going on there. If you want to understand hardware, that's a pretty low level look at it, right? I think it's kind of the crown jewel of the book.

468
00:48:05,260 --> 00:48:29,380
David Kopec: You know, there's a lot of people who are interested in emulators. And what I found before writing the book is there's not a single book out there that talks about writing an NES emulator, which is the most common emulator that people want to write. So I think this is the first book that has a chapter on writing an NES emulator. I will admit I was a little scared of like if Nintendo's legal team is going to like be upset about the book or something like that.

469
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:31,020
David Kopec: But we did research on it.

470
00:48:31,020 --> 00:48:34,740
David Kopec: I mean, everything we're doing is perfectly legal in the book in the United States, at least.

471
00:48:36,180 --> 00:48:36,860
David Kopec: So, yeah.

472
00:48:37,800 --> 00:48:38,380
Speaker 3: But anyway.

473
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:38,720
Speaker 3: Scary, right?

474
00:48:38,980 --> 00:48:39,800
Speaker 3: Yeah, absolutely.

475
00:48:40,120 --> 00:48:43,280
David Kopec: And we put a big disclaimer at the top of the chapter, as you remember reading.

476
00:48:44,280 --> 00:48:48,240
Michael Kennedy: I have a legal, I have a Nintendo story for you.

477
00:48:48,820 --> 00:48:49,060
David Kopec: Great.

478
00:48:49,220 --> 00:48:50,300
Michael Kennedy: From when I was young.

479
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:58,960
Michael Kennedy: And this was, I think this is very late 80s, early 90s, last century.

480
00:48:59,540 --> 00:49:00,440
Michael Kennedy: Now, this was not me.

481
00:49:01,460 --> 00:49:08,020
Michael Kennedy: Someone I knew, someone I was friends with, had, I think it was a Super NES.

482
00:49:08,950 --> 00:49:09,100
Michael Kennedy: Okay.

483
00:49:09,340 --> 00:49:15,820
Michael Kennedy: And people may not remember, but they had these big honking cartridges that go chonk, honk, and you would chunk them down in there.

484
00:49:16,340 --> 00:49:23,700
Michael Kennedy: You would turn on, you basically reboot the NES and it would boot up from the big cartridge, game cartridge you put in there.

485
00:49:25,400 --> 00:49:32,100
Michael Kennedy: And there was this guy that they've, they found somehow, I don't, because there's no internet.

486
00:49:32,520 --> 00:49:34,640
Michael Kennedy: Maybe it's through a BBS. I don't know how this was found.

487
00:49:35,540 --> 00:49:41,020
Michael Kennedy: But they found this guy who built a thing that the bottom half of it looked like a game cartridge.

488
00:49:42,060 --> 00:49:49,840
Michael Kennedy: The top was this whole computer that at the top of it, it had a 3.5 inch floppy drive.

489
00:49:50,600 --> 00:49:50,720
David Kopec: Wow.

490
00:49:51,300 --> 00:50:00,360
Michael Kennedy: So you would go to your BBS, you would find a game, you would put it on a floppy, and then you would slot this huge extra computer down into the NES and you would turn it on.

491
00:50:01,080 --> 00:50:07,280
Michael Kennedy: And it would like delegate the file IO through the little fake cartridge back to it.

492
00:50:07,840 --> 00:50:08,860
Michael Kennedy: And it worked like crazy.

493
00:50:08,860 --> 00:50:09,360
Michael Kennedy: It was perfect.

494
00:50:10,180 --> 00:50:12,000
Michael Kennedy: That guy was not in business for very long.

495
00:50:12,180 --> 00:50:12,900
Michael Kennedy: The guy who sold them.

496
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:17,800
Michael Kennedy: Not my friend, but the person he got it from wasn't available after a while.

497
00:50:18,330 --> 00:50:21,380
David Kopec: So Super NES comes out in like 91.

498
00:50:22,580 --> 00:50:23,820
David Kopec: It might have been a regular.

499
00:50:24,260 --> 00:50:25,960
Michael Kennedy: No, I think I might have been in college.

500
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:28,180
Michael Kennedy: So yeah, it would be 91 onward.

501
00:50:28,470 --> 00:50:28,560
Michael Kennedy: Yeah.

502
00:50:28,780 --> 00:50:28,940
David Kopec: Okay.

503
00:50:29,310 --> 00:50:33,360
David Kopec: I mean, that is very advanced for that time.

504
00:50:33,510 --> 00:50:37,320
David Kopec: When you think about the type of stuff people were modding at that time, that guy was a genius.

505
00:50:38,040 --> 00:50:38,680
David Kopec: Yeah, he was.

506
00:50:38,760 --> 00:50:56,080
Michael Kennedy: he should have been hired if he wasn't you know what i mean yeah yeah absolutely yeah he was building himself out of his dorm room or something i don't know it was i think it was in uh manhattan in uh kansas state university i'm not sure where the guy was but wow oh well anyway yeah that guy

507
00:50:56,100 --> 00:51:32,100
David Kopec: was playing with fire yeah absolutely and you know what um sometimes like understanding how the rom cartridge works right like we think again that it's like all magic right but actually what those big cartridges that we had that we like inserted in the nes were is they were mostly plastic like that did nothing and there was a little rom chip like inside the big hunk of plastic and the rom chip rom just stands for read only memory so most of them were just like a big chunk of memory with a very tiny bit of logic chips that were called mappers on the nes that said like read this memory at this time But again, it wasn't really magic.

508
00:51:32,320 --> 00:51:35,680
David Kopec: And those cartridges look so intimidating, but they were really just a big piece of memory.

509
00:51:36,560 --> 00:51:36,740
Michael Kennedy: Yeah.

510
00:51:37,560 --> 00:51:43,160
Michael Kennedy: Think about how much you've got to make that work right before you ship it.

511
00:51:44,040 --> 00:51:44,160
Michael Kennedy: Yeah.

512
00:51:45,080 --> 00:51:45,780
Michael Kennedy: There's no patches.

513
00:51:46,200 --> 00:51:47,240
Michael Kennedy: There's no download and update.

514
00:51:47,580 --> 00:51:49,880
Michael Kennedy: Once it's shipped, it's shipped.

515
00:51:50,440 --> 00:51:52,320
Michael Kennedy: And it's burned into the ROM and that's it.

516
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:54,880
David Kopec: I have some friends who work in game development.

517
00:51:55,320 --> 00:52:00,160
David Kopec: And before they even shipped the 1.0, nowadays they're working on the first patch.

518
00:52:00,780 --> 00:52:04,900
David Kopec: and they just know they're not going to ship the perfect program in 1.0.

519
00:52:05,300 --> 00:52:07,020
David Kopec: Now, to be fair, games were much simpler

520
00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:09,260
Speaker 3: in the 1980s than they are today.

521
00:52:09,720 --> 00:52:10,500
David Kopec: But they had to be perfect.

522
00:52:11,220 --> 00:52:12,220
David Kopec: Literally had to be perfect.

523
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:21,780
David Kopec: And so there was a certain, I think, different attitude around game development than there is today. And remember, they were also working in assembly language.

524
00:52:23,420 --> 00:52:26,860
Michael Kennedy: It's not even an easy language to work in. I don't know if people like

525
00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:31,740
David Kopec: this word, but I would call it kind of hardcore writing NES games in the 1980s.

526
00:52:34,600 --> 00:52:39,380
Michael Kennedy: It was, you know, that kind of programming, it was just different.

527
00:52:39,800 --> 00:52:40,520
Michael Kennedy: It was just different.

528
00:52:40,700 --> 00:52:45,660
Michael Kennedy: You had to be so detail-oriented and you had to be so thorough.

529
00:52:46,020 --> 00:52:51,400
Michael Kennedy: It's almost like writing, you know, spaceship control software type of thing.

530
00:52:52,020 --> 00:52:52,680
Michael Kennedy: Not quite, but almost.

531
00:52:53,380 --> 00:52:54,700
David Kopec: And the machines were so slow.

532
00:52:54,840 --> 00:53:04,760
David Kopec: The NES, which, you know, we emulate in Chapter 6, ran on a 1.8 megahertz CPU, 6502, 1.8 megahertz, right?

533
00:53:05,150 --> 00:53:10,020
David Kopec: So Super Mario was like an incredible accomplishment on a 1.8 megahertz.

534
00:53:10,250 --> 00:53:21,480
David Kopec: So people had to worry about all these computer science topics in a way that they don't today as programmers because you had to squeeze every last bit of algorithmic performance out of the machine.

535
00:53:22,180 --> 00:53:27,300
David Kopec: And so today, I think we have sloppier software today because we have an embarrassment of riches.

536
00:53:27,620 --> 00:53:33,120
David Kopec: We got such powerful computers with so much memory that people don't worry about writing things as efficiently as possible.

537
00:53:33,550 --> 00:53:41,000
David Kopec: And so we end up with inefficient software sometimes because people don't bother to do the algorithms right.

538
00:53:41,880 --> 00:53:47,420
Michael Kennedy: Yes, but I'm going to put a little double dagger, like see the footnote by your comment.

539
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:53,480
Michael Kennedy: Absolutely true for software, not necessarily true for software developers.

540
00:53:54,360 --> 00:54:06,060
Michael Kennedy: The efficiency of writing a 99.9% correct Python program, how quickly that gets done versus something in assembly language straight on a ROM.

541
00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:06,960
Michael Kennedy: Yep.

542
00:54:07,480 --> 00:54:07,900
Michael Kennedy: You know what I mean?

543
00:54:08,780 --> 00:54:23,180
Michael Kennedy: I think this is an interesting arc, and maybe you could speak to it a little bit from your academic perspective, but I think it's a really interesting arc of it used to be really hard to program, and we'd solve small problems with lots of effort.

544
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:24,960
Michael Kennedy: And it's getting easier.

545
00:54:25,010 --> 00:54:26,440
Michael Kennedy: And a lot of times it gets easier.

546
00:54:26,540 --> 00:54:27,640
Michael Kennedy: People say, well, there it goes.

547
00:54:28,440 --> 00:54:29,080
Michael Kennedy: Job's over.

548
00:54:29,660 --> 00:54:32,400
Michael Kennedy: There's not going to be programmers anymore because everyone can do it.

549
00:54:32,840 --> 00:54:35,100
Michael Kennedy: And we just solve bigger, more complex problems.

550
00:54:35,900 --> 00:54:36,900
Michael Kennedy: And it just keeps building.

551
00:54:37,430 --> 00:54:48,840
Michael Kennedy: You know, like a web app, a basic e-commerce app from today was a keynote presentation of how like a Fortune 500 company pulled it off in 1990.

552
00:54:49,070 --> 00:54:49,560
Michael Kennedy: You know what I mean?

553
00:54:49,780 --> 00:54:55,240
Speaker 3: Like, here's how we got the SSL termination special machines to handle the SSL decryption

554
00:54:55,880 --> 00:54:58,100
Michael Kennedy: so that we could do this under two seconds of requests.

555
00:54:58,300 --> 00:54:59,660
David Kopec: I mean, like crazy stuff.

556
00:55:00,080 --> 00:55:01,080
Michael Kennedy: What do you think about this?

557
00:55:01,520 --> 00:55:02,480
David Kopec: Well, it's not an either or.

558
00:55:02,740 --> 00:55:06,160
David Kopec: I mean, we want developers to be productive and we also want efficient software.

559
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:15,440
David Kopec: So, I mean, the good news is that means that after we make it easier and easier to build software, we still need folks who are going to work on optimizing that software after it's built.

560
00:55:15,540 --> 00:55:18,540
David Kopec: So there's still jobs for software developers who are interested in that.

561
00:55:18,900 --> 00:55:28,720
David Kopec: I think you actually touched on this in Talk Python in production to some degree, because you talk about in the book, the appropriate level of complexity for the type of app that you're building.

562
00:55:29,160 --> 00:55:38,240
David Kopec: And so you talk about like, you know, maybe you don't need a Kubernetes cluster if you're just building, you know, something for 10 million requests a month and not something

563
00:55:38,440 --> 00:55:39,560
Michael Kennedy: for a billion requests a month.

564
00:55:39,600 --> 00:55:46,240
Michael Kennedy: And it's going to be run by one person or one person part time versus a team or somebody who's a DevOps expert, right?

565
00:55:46,720 --> 00:55:47,380
David Kopec: Right, right, right.

566
00:55:47,600 --> 00:56:17,380
David Kopec: So if I'm working on a run-of-the-mill e-commerce thing, maybe I don't worry about squeezing out every last bit of performance because I want to productively make something that, like you said, is 99.9% of the way there as quickly as possible. But if I'm building a 3D game, they still build most 3D games in C++ because they need to squeeze out every last bit of performance, even if it's a little less efficient for the programmers. The programmers could write the games faster maybe in another language or another framework than they're using, whatever.

567
00:56:17,860 --> 00:56:21,020
David Kopec: but they use something that squeezes out every last bit of performance.

568
00:56:21,420 --> 00:56:23,820
David Kopec: So I think you have to think about what is the app that we're building?

569
00:56:23,930 --> 00:56:25,380
David Kopec: What is the domain that we're in?

570
00:56:25,760 --> 00:56:27,540
Speaker 3: And it's also just not an either or.

571
00:56:27,800 --> 00:56:34,480
David Kopec: Like, you know, we want to have software that's both developer productive to build, but also that's efficient to run.

572
00:56:35,020 --> 00:56:36,300
David Kopec: And it's an ongoing process.

573
00:56:36,510 --> 00:56:40,600
David Kopec: We might need to make that trade-off more in the way when we're first building it in developer productivity.

574
00:56:41,180 --> 00:56:44,320
David Kopec: And then as we're maintaining it, maybe we go more towards the efficiency side.

575
00:56:44,680 --> 00:56:52,200
David Kopec: But if you don't think about some of the efficiency things up front, you can end up in a bad spot because you can get some technical debt.

576
00:56:52,230 --> 00:56:59,360
David Kopec: You could end up in a situation where it's hard to undo some of the algorithmic mistakes that you made early on and the system starts to depend on.

577
00:57:00,760 --> 00:57:02,160
David Kopec: So you should think about it at least a little bit.

578
00:57:02,460 --> 00:57:03,140
Michael Kennedy: Yeah, absolutely.

579
00:57:03,550 --> 00:57:08,780
Michael Kennedy: And I think you're talking about they've got to squeeze out that little extra bit of performance because they want high frame rates.

580
00:57:09,320 --> 00:57:14,140
Michael Kennedy: They might have to squeeze out that little bit extra performance because it's either possible or not possible.

581
00:57:15,080 --> 00:57:27,620
Michael Kennedy: you know you look at some of the stuff in the unreal engine these days and you're like that's real time that's the game that looks like a rendered cgi movie not a game

582
00:57:28,550 --> 00:57:49,720
David Kopec: yeah yeah yeah yeah and i mean so a lot of it is being done for us today by library authors right so library authors are thinking about a lot of the low-level stuff so us as like run-of-the-mill developers don't need to, which is great. But if you're doing something really de novo, something with an innovative algorithm, you still need to consider efficiency at least.

583
00:57:50,010 --> 00:58:14,280
Michael Kennedy: Yeah. And the other thing is, you can write really slow code in C, and you can write really fast code in Python or vice versa. It's easier to make it slow in Python, to be fair. But algorithms and data structures are tremendous influences, right? If you're using, you should a set or a dictionary and you're using a list, you're probably having a real bad time performance.

584
00:58:15,080 --> 00:58:47,800
David Kopec: And you caught me multiple times on the technical review in places where I should have used a set and I used a list. So thank you for that. But that's absolutely, that's a great example. I mean, just knowing that basic fact that, you know, in this situation, just swapping out, which is a simple switch, by the way, you know, one data structure for another can totally change the performance characteristics. That's the type of things you do learn in the CS degree that you don't necessarily learn when you're a self-taught programmer kind of hacking everything out on your own, which is why a book like classic computer science problems in Python, or maybe computer

585
00:58:47,890 --> 00:58:58,340
Michael Kennedy: science from scratch is good for that. Yeah, it exposes you to this. Here's a data structure you haven't thought about, but here's why we're using it and the advantages and stuff. Yeah, absolutely.

586
00:59:00,580 --> 00:59:31,400
Michael Kennedy: All right, well, we've covered a lot. We've covered pretty much solved computer science in 2025. That's good. And then the book is bringing computer science to so many people who are self-taught, you know, like me. I went to college, but I studied many, many years of math and found my way into programming. So I took a few CS programs, but not so many. So, you know, it certainly showed me many things that I hadn't seen. Like I've never emulated hardware before, for example. That was wild.

587
00:59:34,280 --> 00:59:41,720
David Kopec: And, you know, Michael, I was reading in Talk Python in production that you actually worked on Windows desktop apps. Is that right? I did. Yeah.

588
00:59:42,240 --> 00:59:45,420
Michael Kennedy: For 10 years, more than 10 years. Almost 15 years, yeah.

589
00:59:45,900 --> 00:59:54,560
David Kopec: Wow. So I'm curious, you know, how did you feel about that experience versus the kind of Python GUI frameworks that exist today?

590
00:59:56,240 --> 00:59:57,780
Michael Kennedy: You heard my rant about Visual Basic.

591
00:59:58,080 --> 00:59:59,880
David Kopec: I was such a fan of Windows Forms.

592
01:00:00,190 --> 01:00:04,600
Michael Kennedy: I started actually in C++, starting the hard way, doing MFC.

593
01:00:04,810 --> 01:00:06,620
Speaker 3: I don't know if you ever played with that or heard of that.

594
01:00:06,620 --> 01:00:07,680
Speaker 3: Yeah, like the soft foundation classes.

595
01:00:07,870 --> 01:00:08,180
Speaker 3: Yeah, yeah.

596
01:00:08,280 --> 01:00:10,660
Michael Kennedy: And that was actually pretty decent for C++ framework.

597
01:00:10,850 --> 01:00:14,600
Michael Kennedy: And then as soon as I found Visual Basic and C#, I'm like, this is so much better.

598
01:00:15,460 --> 01:00:19,400
Michael Kennedy: It goes from weeks to days of UI work and stuff like that.

599
01:00:19,430 --> 01:00:24,340
Michael Kennedy: And it took me a while to really appreciate building for the web.

600
01:00:25,100 --> 01:00:27,400
Michael Kennedy: I think I probably made that switch around the year 2000.

601
01:00:27,880 --> 01:00:32,100
Michael Kennedy: There's a little bit after that, but I really like the web these days.

602
01:00:32,190 --> 01:00:33,240
Michael Kennedy: I think the web is special.

603
01:00:33,760 --> 01:00:39,660
Michael Kennedy: I just wish it was easier to take apps from the web and get them to people.

604
01:00:39,960 --> 01:00:43,540
Michael Kennedy: For example, Firefox canceled progressive web apps.

605
01:00:44,820 --> 01:00:48,960
Michael Kennedy: iOS has them, but they're kind of, let's not talk about those.

606
01:00:49,130 --> 01:00:51,800
Michael Kennedy: And if you know the secret, you can probably install one, but you probably shouldn't.

607
01:00:52,040 --> 01:00:58,020
Michael Kennedy: And we're going to, you know, like if it's just, it's like right on the verge of one more step.

608
01:00:58,540 --> 01:01:02,380
Michael Kennedy: And the web would be really, a really good replacement for those.

609
01:01:02,640 --> 01:01:08,840
Michael Kennedy: And now we have things like Electron and so on, which I'm not a huge fan of, but it's, it's kind of what we need to make that happen.

610
01:01:09,130 --> 01:01:12,480
Michael Kennedy: But we don't necessarily need Electron, right?

611
01:01:12,510 --> 01:01:13,280
Michael Kennedy: It would be really great.

612
01:01:13,480 --> 01:01:14,700
Michael Kennedy: I'm also really excited.

613
01:01:14,790 --> 01:01:16,020
Michael Kennedy: I don't know how you feel about it.

614
01:01:16,060 --> 01:01:22,340
Michael Kennedy: I'm really excited about PyScript and the possibility of running Python for your front-end stuff.

615
01:01:23,460 --> 01:01:30,240
David Kopec: Well, I guess what I was getting at is why do you think Python is not taken off more for desktop GUI development?

616
01:01:30,330 --> 01:01:31,860
Speaker 3: So like we've seen things like Givi.

617
01:01:32,260 --> 01:01:38,660
David Kopec: Of course, we have PyQT and several other frameworks that wrap into older C++ GUI frameworks.

618
01:01:39,420 --> 01:01:42,260
David Kopec: But like Python now is so mature.

619
01:01:42,380 --> 01:01:43,680
David Kopec: It's the most popular language in the world.

620
01:01:44,160 --> 01:01:45,320
Michael Kennedy: There's nothing preventing it.

621
01:01:45,540 --> 01:01:51,900
Michael Kennedy: Yeah, there's nothing preventing it from making a really nice platform for native app development, right?

622
01:01:52,700 --> 01:02:01,400
Michael Kennedy: Fundamentally, you could come up with a framework that abstracts talking to Objective-C, the API's there, or the Win32 API.

623
01:02:02,720 --> 01:02:16,040
Michael Kennedy: You know, one of the things I'm starting to realize that makes desktop development really different from back in the day, if you will, there are so many gatekeepers and barriers to getting your app onto a machine, right?

624
01:02:16,120 --> 01:02:22,360
Michael Kennedy: Like if I built a cool desktop app and I gave it to you, your Mac would go, no, we're not running that.

625
01:02:22,560 --> 01:02:26,720
Michael Kennedy: We moved it to the trash for you because it wasn't notarized, right?

626
01:02:26,980 --> 01:02:28,680
Michael Kennedy: And something similar happens on Windows.

627
01:02:29,280 --> 01:02:32,440
Michael Kennedy: And so there's these steps you got to jump through.

628
01:02:33,200 --> 01:02:42,560
Michael Kennedy: And I think there's just been too many gotchas and steps for anybody to push a framework or a way of doing this all the way through.

629
01:02:44,040 --> 01:02:49,700
Michael Kennedy: I mean, in a sense, the web is kind of good enough that we don't have to figure out a way to build this.

630
01:02:50,800 --> 01:03:00,040
Michael Kennedy: I think, honestly, if I were to be more concerned, I'd be more concerned that we can't create truly straightforward mobile apps with Python than desktop apps.

631
01:03:00,840 --> 01:03:01,400
David Kopec: Yeah, what do you think?

632
01:03:01,760 --> 01:03:03,760
David Kopec: That's where I was going to go to next, yeah.

633
01:03:03,930 --> 01:03:05,820
David Kopec: And I mean, Kivy has been an attempt at that.

634
01:03:06,640 --> 01:03:11,380
David Kopec: But, you know, I don't really think it's gotten a ton of track from what I see.

635
01:03:12,040 --> 01:03:16,340
David Kopec: It doesn't look like it's gotten a ton of traction in the way people in the Python community hoped it would.

636
01:03:17,520 --> 01:03:18,580
Michael Kennedy: So, you know, I don't.

637
01:03:18,760 --> 01:03:21,660
Michael Kennedy: We're doing good work, but it's also not there yet.

638
01:03:21,730 --> 01:03:22,320
Michael Kennedy: I don't think.

639
01:03:22,890 --> 01:03:27,480
David Kopec: I wonder if some of the performance issues, you know, are part of this.

640
01:03:28,220 --> 01:03:36,380
David Kopec: So, you know, people expect one of the reasons we like desktop apps and native mobile apps over web apps is because we get instantaneous feedback.

641
01:03:36,440 --> 01:03:39,280
David Kopec: and, you know, really high performance in our user interfaces.

642
01:03:40,180 --> 01:03:48,540
David Kopec: And, you know, I still find even a PyQT app sometimes a little bit slower than, you know, a regular QT app.

643
01:03:48,740 --> 01:03:49,460
Speaker 3: Yeah, yeah.

644
01:03:49,700 --> 01:03:51,560
David Kopec: And, you know, it's unfortunate.

645
01:03:52,060 --> 01:03:59,840
David Kopec: For me, like the big want for the whole Python ecosystem is what started to be the focus, I think, of the core developers, which is performance improvements.

646
01:04:00,440 --> 01:04:02,240
Speaker 3: Like, I think that performance improvements

647
01:04:02,620 --> 01:04:11,260
David Kopec: would make everyone's lives in the ecosystem so much better, you know and so i i think rightly that that this has become like one of the central focuses

648
01:04:12,060 --> 01:04:28,880
Michael Kennedy: of um you know of the core developers yeah guido mark shannon bram buker a bunch of people whose names i'm not including they've all done really good work over the last three or four years um i was a little bit sad to see microsoft cancel that project or cancel the funding

649
01:04:29,020 --> 01:04:36,160
David Kopec: for that project i mean the project continues but still you know i like what has happened is

650
01:04:36,180 --> 01:04:41,040
Michael Kennedy: so, so much better. That is really a big deal. Yeah. Yeah. And you know, I even saw it in the

651
01:04:41,090 --> 01:05:00,940
David Kopec: course of writing the book. I started writing the book in 2021 and that NES emulator on the same machine was something like 12 frames per second in 2021. And by 2025, it was like 17 frames or 15 or 17. So it really, you know, I really saw it in these computationally intensive programs in the

652
01:05:00,860 --> 01:05:33,440
Michael Kennedy: book? I'm pretty positive for it. I mean, there's, there's a lot of things that could be better, but I think one of the real superpowers is it's approachable, but it's ceiling of Python. That is it's ceiling of what you can accomplish is not that low, right? You can go pretty far if you have CS skills and ideas. And then, you know, pip install, uv install, like the options of what is out there to just build and click together are incredible.

653
01:05:34,080 --> 01:05:45,100
David Kopec: What do you think about, and I know you talked about on the show before I heard about a while ago on the show about Mojo and about,  you know, a total attempt that, you know, let's just

654
01:05:46,120 --> 01:05:50,860
Michael Kennedy: redo it. and we'll get, let's keep the language syntax, but not the runtime.

655
01:05:51,360 --> 01:06:06,900
David Kopec: Right, right, right. And I mean, PyPy is also, of course, kind of an attempt at that as well. And some people call for it, right? I see sometimes people are like, why don't they replace CPython with PyPy? What do you think about kind of just like the whole, maybe it's too big a topic for the end of this.

656
01:06:06,920 --> 01:06:07,560
Michael Kennedy: No, it's interesting.

657
01:06:07,700 --> 01:06:10,900
Michael Kennedy: I think all of those are interesting.

658
01:06:11,820 --> 01:06:15,260
Michael Kennedy: I think the Mojo performance story is very powerful.

659
01:06:16,580 --> 01:06:22,460
Michael Kennedy: It's also really hard to bring over to CPython because there's so many different ways that it's used.

660
01:06:22,500 --> 01:06:28,680
Michael Kennedy: And there's so many-- it runs on this piece of hardware doing this thing that we just could never optimize for.

661
01:06:31,420 --> 01:07:05,280
Michael Kennedy: And then, like I said, with 600,000 or whatever there are packages, you know, how much of that are you willing to carve away to get a faster language? And what I think also is a really interesting aspect that people might not think about or take into account that often is you'll see a lot of these benchmarks like here's the three body solving the three body problem in Python and here's solving it in Mojo. Here's solving the three body problem in Rust and look at that huge difference. But what often happens in Python is you find yourself orchestrating native code anyway.

662
01:07:05,540 --> 01:07:09,060
Michael Kennedy: Like, okay, we're going to use pollers, and we're going to do this thing.

663
01:07:09,350 --> 01:07:12,700
Michael Kennedy: But when I call the pollers functions, I'm no longer running Python.

664
01:07:12,920 --> 01:07:16,300
Michael Kennedy: I'm running like a drop of Python and a bunch of Rust.

665
01:07:17,220 --> 01:07:18,420
Speaker 3: And then you write back in the same...

666
01:07:18,690 --> 01:07:20,640
Michael Kennedy: Or I'm talking to a database layer.

667
01:07:21,860 --> 01:07:25,600
Michael Kennedy: Or my web app is running on a Rust-based server.

668
01:07:25,720 --> 01:07:34,100
Michael Kennedy: There's just all these little parts where a lot of times your code speed is more about how you're putting the pieces together.

669
01:07:36,080 --> 01:07:36,180
Michael Kennedy: Yeah.

670
01:07:36,540 --> 01:07:36,860
Michael Kennedy: Not always.

671
01:07:36,920 --> 01:07:40,500
Michael Kennedy: If you're doing computational stuff, that's out the window potentially.

672
01:07:40,920 --> 01:07:47,260
Michael Kennedy: But when you're kind of, you know, you're doing machine learning, you're doing web apps, you're doing database calls.

673
01:07:47,300 --> 01:07:50,320
Michael Kennedy: A lot of these are like just a layer and then off it goes.

674
01:07:52,020 --> 01:07:53,320
David Kopec: Yeah, that totally makes sense.

675
01:07:53,480 --> 01:08:05,220
David Kopec: But then I think it is holding Python back from some of those, you know, some of these real interesting domains that people want to get into, especially when they're first learning programming, like 3D games.

676
01:08:12,540 --> 01:08:16,020
David Kopec: Let's stick with that, because I'm thinking of ones for people in computer science education.

677
01:08:16,880 --> 01:08:20,279
David Kopec: A lot of people who study computer science is because they want to make a game.

678
01:08:20,640 --> 01:08:20,799
Michael Kennedy: Sure.

679
01:08:21,200 --> 01:08:22,420
David Kopec: And when they want to make a game...

680
01:08:22,420 --> 01:08:23,180
Michael Kennedy: And I can see a world...

681
01:08:23,180 --> 01:08:25,359
Michael Kennedy: Look at one of the biggest game companies in the world.

682
01:08:25,520 --> 01:08:26,020
Michael Kennedy: It's Unity.

683
01:08:26,630 --> 01:08:26,759
Speaker 3: Yeah.

684
01:08:27,080 --> 01:08:27,200
Michael Kennedy: Right?

685
01:08:27,580 --> 01:09:36,160
Michael Kennedy: right as a foundational like building your game with not creator of games they're built i believe in csharp and.net if i remember correctly yep and that's a faster language but it's not raging fast you know it's it's it's a lot faster but it's still a decent way from a c like a pure c language right yeah a pure c implementation and they're really really successful they got close enough i could easily see some company go we're going to build a game engine and we're going to use python as the language to get as many people who have been left out in the cold in a sense to do it but we're going to do a mojo like thing or we're going to do something where you don't get to use every library but do you really need flask in your game not in your game you know what i mean yeah we're going to build like a a smaller focused high performance version that looks as close as it could be. And we're going to sell you a game engine in a way to ship those games on Steam, a way to ship those games on Metal to macOS, etc. Right?

686
01:09:36,319 --> 01:09:40,740
David Kopec: Like I could see that world happen. Yeah, yeah. I don't see me making that world, but I could see

687
01:09:40,859 --> 01:09:44,759
Michael Kennedy: that happen. And then actually, I think it would be okay. How do you feel? Like, do you see that

688
01:09:44,839 --> 01:10:22,380
David Kopec: as possible? No, that makes total sense. I think another thing we think about is like how much our skills becoming more transferable because of LLMs. So can somebody who already learned Python well, now quickly pick up C# in Unity, because the LLM is doing a lot of the detailed syntax for them. And they just have to understand the programmatic ideas. So is like, you know, maybe Python will continue to always be this great first language for everybody. And it'll be easier for people to now transition to other languages for specific domains. And so it matters less that we everything in the original language.

689
01:10:23,780 --> 01:10:32,420
Michael Kennedy: Okay, out in the chat, there's the recommendation for-- that's Godot.

690
01:10:32,640 --> 01:10:33,400
Michael Kennedy: Do you remember Godot?

691
01:10:33,460 --> 01:10:34,780
Michael Kennedy: I'm not super familiar with it.

692
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:37,000
David Kopec: I think it's an open source game engine.

693
01:10:37,320 --> 01:10:39,900
Michael Kennedy: Yes, that much I know, but that's where my knowledge stops.

694
01:10:40,300 --> 01:10:49,980
David Kopec: Right, and I think it has like a Godot script or something, or Gscript or something, is its language, which I think has more of a Python-like syntax. Somebody in the chat

695
01:10:50,070 --> 01:10:50,600
Michael Kennedy: can correct me.

696
01:10:52,720 --> 01:10:59,220
Michael Kennedy: Interesting. Okay, but I think if you took an end-to-end thing, it's not just a matter of like, oh, you can run the game engine with this.

697
01:11:00,760 --> 01:11:03,960
Michael Kennedy: You've got to take it all the way to, here's how you ship your games.

698
01:11:05,020 --> 01:11:09,860
Michael Kennedy: Because what is the very first thing you want to do once you get your game working and fun? You want to show your friends.

699
01:11:10,200 --> 01:11:13,660
Michael Kennedy: You know what I mean? And you've got to find a way to send it out.

700
01:11:14,600 --> 01:11:21,820
David Kopec: So this goes back to what you were talking about earlier is all the hurdles around, you know, getting something on the Mac App Store, Steam or, you know, or whatever.

701
01:11:23,120 --> 01:11:29,800
David Kopec: And that goes also to another big thing that we're trying to solve in the Python ecosystem, which is the packaging story, right?

702
01:11:30,360 --> 01:11:36,860
David Kopec: Which there are many solutions for, but just not one decided on, let's make this the standard, like, you know, as easy as possible thing.

703
01:11:37,540 --> 01:11:38,380
Michael Kennedy: Yeah, it's getting better.

704
01:11:38,820 --> 01:11:39,760
Michael Kennedy: Things are definitely getting better.

705
01:11:39,980 --> 01:11:47,460
Michael Kennedy: but it's still, there is no Python build --format equals exe.

706
01:11:48,010 --> 01:11:48,140
Speaker 3: Right.

707
01:11:48,380 --> 01:11:59,620
Michael Kennedy: You know, where what comes out and then some sort of tooling that automatically signs that stuff with your certificate you've got as a Windows developer so it doesn't get flags as malware.

708
01:12:00,320 --> 01:12:05,100
Michael Kennedy: There's just, even if you get the thing to build, there's like these three or four other steps.

709
01:12:05,310 --> 01:12:06,960
Michael Kennedy: You know, I'm thinking about in iOS.

710
01:12:07,260 --> 01:12:17,260
Michael Kennedy: It's like, okay, we got it to run Python, But really what we needed to do is like integrate with Swift UI and have storyboards where I can weave it.

711
01:12:17,320 --> 01:12:19,880
Michael Kennedy: And you're like, well, that's a long ways away.

712
01:12:20,080 --> 01:12:23,560
Michael Kennedy: Like I know, but that's, you got to go through those stages to get it.

713
01:12:23,620 --> 01:12:24,020
Michael Kennedy: I don't know.

714
01:12:24,120 --> 01:12:27,560
Michael Kennedy: It's just, there's a little bit further to go, I guess.

715
01:12:27,680 --> 01:12:28,780
Michael Kennedy: But I would love to see it.

716
01:12:28,800 --> 01:12:30,260
Michael Kennedy: And I think it'll happen probably.

717
01:12:30,760 --> 01:12:31,880
David Kopec: It's not that you can't do it.

718
01:12:31,880 --> 01:12:33,380
David Kopec: It's just there's too much friction right now.

719
01:12:33,880 --> 01:12:34,100
Michael Kennedy: Yeah.

720
01:12:34,600 --> 01:12:34,840
Michael Kennedy: Yeah.

721
01:12:35,860 --> 01:12:35,920
Michael Kennedy: Yeah.

722
01:12:36,720 --> 01:12:39,600
Michael Kennedy: Well, hopefully you give some people some ideas.

723
01:12:40,180 --> 01:12:48,920
Michael Kennedy: Somebody's going to go start the Unity, the Pi Unity company or whatever, and let's make it happen.

724
01:12:49,320 --> 01:12:49,560
Speaker 3: Yeah.

725
01:12:50,460 --> 01:12:50,560
Michael Kennedy: Yeah.

726
01:12:51,120 --> 01:12:54,540
Michael Kennedy: Oh, and also just real-time follow-up out there.

727
01:12:54,840 --> 01:12:57,600
Michael Kennedy: Godot is apparently the pronunciation.

728
01:12:57,840 --> 01:12:58,080
Michael Kennedy: It's French.

729
01:12:58,100 --> 01:12:58,400
Speaker 3: Sorry.

730
01:12:58,940 --> 01:12:59,060
Michael Kennedy: Okay.

731
01:12:59,060 --> 01:13:00,000
Speaker 3: No, no, I didn't know it either.

732
01:13:01,220 --> 01:13:02,700
Michael Kennedy: I think, honestly, just shout out to everyone.

733
01:13:02,800 --> 01:13:07,580
Michael Kennedy: if you have a weird name for your project on GitHub, put an mp3 and say this is how you say it.

734
01:13:07,630 --> 01:13:13,480
Michael Kennedy: Just get it. Let's help us out. Not that French is weird, but just, you know,

735
01:13:14,040 --> 01:13:17,360
David Kopec: we should actually do that with English Project 2, right? Yeah, absolutely.

736
01:13:17,750 --> 01:13:31,820
Michael Kennedy: Yeah, even accessible to the, yeah. As simple, yeah, it has nothing to do with French. I'm thinking even as something simple as G Unicorn is often said, Gunicorn. And half the people out out there are probably thinking, Michael, you're wrong.

737
01:13:31,850 --> 01:13:33,040
Michael Kennedy: It's Goonicorn, not G-U-N-I-C-O-N.

738
01:13:33,960 --> 01:13:36,080
Michael Kennedy: But their logo is a green unicorn.

739
01:13:37,940 --> 01:13:40,400
Michael Kennedy: I'm like, well, it's probably the G stand, just G.

740
01:13:40,530 --> 01:13:44,360
Michael Kennedy: And then certainly the unicorn part is probably unicorn because unicorn is-- you know what I mean?

741
01:13:44,640 --> 01:13:51,060
Michael Kennedy: But it's totally reasonable to look at it and go, Goonicorn, you know what I mean?

742
01:13:51,540 --> 01:13:57,900
Michael Kennedy: But if they just put a little MP3, or even just a word, it's pronounced G-E-E-Dash Unicorn.

743
01:13:57,950 --> 01:13:58,360
Michael Kennedy: You know what I mean?

744
01:13:58,760 --> 01:13:59,160
Speaker 3: Yeah, yeah.

745
01:13:59,440 --> 01:14:00,560
David Kopec: I think we all need to do that.

746
01:14:00,810 --> 01:14:00,920
Michael Kennedy: Yeah.

747
01:14:01,200 --> 01:14:01,340
Michael Kennedy: Yeah.

748
01:14:03,900 --> 01:14:04,200
Michael Kennedy: All right.

749
01:14:04,290 --> 01:14:12,780
Michael Kennedy: Well, the chat is getting lively, but we're going to have to call it because we might be just a tiny bit over time and it's getting late and you're part of the world.

750
01:14:13,420 --> 01:14:16,860
David Kopec: Well, thank you so much for having me on again, Michael.

751
01:14:17,220 --> 01:14:17,960
David Kopec: It was really a pleasure.

752
01:14:18,240 --> 01:14:20,540
David Kopec: Congratulations again on Talk Python in production.

753
01:14:21,260 --> 01:14:21,540
Michael Kennedy: Thank you.

754
01:14:22,720 --> 01:14:24,260
Michael Kennedy: And Computer Science from Scratch as well.

755
01:14:24,660 --> 01:14:24,820
Michael Kennedy: Yeah.

756
01:14:25,080 --> 01:14:32,040
David Kopec: If folks want to check out the book, there's a website that I'm sure you'll put in the show notes, computersciencefromscratch.com.

757
01:14:32,900 --> 01:14:39,340
David Kopec: And you can just learn more about the different projects we do and some of the ideas in the book.

758
01:14:39,820 --> 01:14:40,320
Michael Kennedy: Yeah, awesome.

759
01:14:40,480 --> 01:14:42,020
Michael Kennedy: People want to get in touch with you otherwise?

760
01:14:42,220 --> 01:14:42,760
Michael Kennedy: How do they do that?

761
01:14:43,260 --> 01:14:43,580
David Kopec: Sure.

762
01:14:44,260 --> 01:14:49,100
David Kopec: You can find me on X, I guess, at Dave Kopech, D-A-V-E-K-O-P-C.

763
01:14:49,290 --> 01:14:54,640
David Kopec: And if you go to my website, davekopech.com, there's email and a bunch of other ways to contact me.

764
01:14:54,900 --> 01:14:56,900
David Kopec: So D-A-V-E-K-O-P-E-C.com.

765
01:14:57,680 --> 01:14:58,400
Michael Kennedy: Yeah, I'll put it in the show notes.

766
01:14:59,190 --> 01:14:59,620
