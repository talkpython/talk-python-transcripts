00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.760
Hey, YouTube. Hello, everyone out there. Megan, Mike, happy to have you on the podcast.


00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:13.760
It's going to be great to talk about things with you. So let's go ahead and kick this off.


00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:17.260
Welcome. We're happy to be here.


00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:29.760
Yeah. Yeah. It's great to have you here. I'm such a fan of space and just it's amazing to think about our place in the universe.


00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:34.160
and where we are and so much of that has been revealed


00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:36.680
really through telescopes, right?


00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:38.280
From the very beginning of like,


00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.120
oh look, the sun doesn't rotate around us,


00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:43.640
how weird to, you know, the universe is expanding


00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:47.640
with what Hubble did or just all the amazing discoveries


00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.280
we've had, the exoplanets and whatnot.


00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:51.480
So super cool.


00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.000
And if we're gonna mix Python into that,


00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.400
that is definitely an interesting thing to do.


00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:59.080
So I'm happy to have you both here to talk about that.


00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:00.960
- Yeah, we're happy to join you.


00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:01.880
- Yeah, it's great.


00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:03.720
- Yeah, for sure.


00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:07.400
So let's just really quickly before we get into the topics,


00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:09.480
maybe start with just a little bit of a story


00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:10.840
on your background.


00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:12.600
Now, Megan, how'd you get into programming


00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.240
and find your way over to Python?


00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:17.000
- Yeah, so programming.


00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.000
I started young and it was mostly because I was jealous


00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.680
of some of the other kids, this is the early 80s,


00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:28.400
that had access to the new Atari systems,


00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:31.560
new ColecoVisions and I didn't really have that.


00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.720
I wanted to be able to play games and do those types of things.


00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:40.960
As it turned out, my dad had just bought one of these new computers in Osborne,


00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:44.440
which is one of the early personal laptop.


00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:46.720
It might be the first laptop,


00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:49.800
a very heavy laptop though.


00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:54.320
>> Probably not as good battery life as today either, I would suspect.


00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:56.240
>> I don't think, yeah, there's no battery life.


00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.800
>> Yeah.


00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:59.240
and it only had a small green screen


00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:01.680
and you couldn't display graphics,


00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.960
but I was determined I was gonna play a game on it.


00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:09.000
So I found this programming book in Basic


00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.440
for microprocessors and followed along,


00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:16.080
learned what it was doing to create responses on the screen


00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:18.800
and ended up making things like Mad Libs


00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:21.760
and Choose Your Own Adventure and ASCII art


00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:23.320
and stuff like that.


00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:26.440
And just learning what the commands I was doing really did.


00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:32.040
So that got me into programming and I kind of just did that on and off.


00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:37.120
It was really strange, even though I was always working with computers, when I hit college,


00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:40.960
nobody ever suggested to me that I should do computer science, that I should be a programmer


00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:43.780
or that I should do this other thing.


00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:49.140
So I went along with some of my other interests, which were astronomy and physics and music.


00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:55.080
But even in astronomy, software and software engineering and working with computers is


00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:56.080
a must.


00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:56.920
- Yeah.


00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:59.260
- And after I started working at the Institute


00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.680
for a few years, Python started becoming


00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:05.740
a much more used language and something


00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:07.620
that could provide real benefit


00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:08.980
for the scientific community.


00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:10.980
And so I started learning that


00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:13.320
and that's how I got into Python.


00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:14.240
- Wow, fantastic.


00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:18.600
Yeah, the days of just holding up a telescope


00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:21.940
and looking at stuff, those are pretty long gone, right?


00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:23.620
- Yeah, they're pretty long gone.


00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:25.660
In fact, most astronomers don't even get


00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:28.380
to go to the telescope on the ground anymore.


00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:29.900
There's a lot of remote observing.


00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:33.540
It was starting to switch over when I was in college.


00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:35.980
It's much, much heavier now.


00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:37.540
- Yeah, I can imagine.


00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:39.460
What a bummer, those are amazing places.


00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:40.780
- Yeah.


00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:41.820
- Mike, how about you?


00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:43.460
Sorry, you can go ahead and finish your thought.


00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:44.820
- No, go ahead.


00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:45.780
- All right, Mike, how about you?


00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:47.340
How'd you get into programming Python?


00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:49.860
- Yeah, for me, I dabbed a toe in it in high school


00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:51.200
with a Fortran class.


00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:52.820
We actually got bussed over to another school


00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:55.500
to run our deck of cards through someone else's computer.


00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:56.700
>> Oh, my god.


00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:58.660
That's another level right there.


00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:00.140
>> I'm that ancient.


00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:02.380
And then in college, a few classes here and there.


00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:06.300
And then when I got out, one of the only skills I had


00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:07.020
was programming.


00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:11.820
So I had a math degree and so started with programming


00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:15.020
in Fortran at the start, but then got into other languages


00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:19.500
and eventually got to Space Telescope in 1996


00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:21.340
and have been here ever since.


00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:23.500
I started with Python about 2002.


00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:25.740
There was a software conference called ADAS,


00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:30.980
A-D-A-S-S, Astronomy, Data Analysis, and Software Systems.


00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:33.980
And we put one on, the institute that I work at,


00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:35.900
put one on in 2002 in Baltimore.


00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:38.220
And Python was really a highlight of that conference.


00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:39.860
It was really coming into its own.


00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:42.460
And that just kind of broke the door down for everyone


00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:44.020
at the institute.


00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:46.820
Behind one of our founders, Perry Greenfield,


00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:49.340
who works at the institute, is very, very big


00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:50.300
in the Python community.


00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:52.620
And he kind of led the way, and we all followed.


00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:53.740
Right on.


00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:56.940
Well, it's certainly an amazing language for data science


00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:02.420
and for working with things like these telescopes and whatnot.


00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:07.140
So it has this special blend of approachability,


00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:10.180
but you can actually do quite a bit of real stuff with it.


00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:12.780
Whereas so many other languages are either approachable


00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:14.940
or you can do real stuff, but not both.


00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:15.860
Yeah.


00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:18.780
It also cuts down a lot on development time and lines


00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:20.700
of code and stuff like that, which


00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:23.320
makes it a lot easier to maintain larger systems that


00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:24.680
can handle the Python.


00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:25.560
Yeah, absolutely.


00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:26.960
I was impressed with the clarity.


00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:28.680
When you looked at a piece of Python code,


00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:31.760
you stripped away all the syntax and all the language


00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:33.480
decorations, and it was just--


00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:34.960
the design was staring at you.


00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:39.440
So to me, it's the simplicity of it that's the best feature.


00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:42.160
Yeah, absolutely.


00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:44.880
So let's start our conversation maybe


00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:49.920
by talking about where you two work at the Space Telescope


00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:52.440
Science Institute. Just sounds so amazing.


00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:55.440
That is a cool name.


00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:58.040
Yeah. So what do you do there? Megan, you wanna go first?


00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:03.720
Yeah, sure. So right now, I'm the technical lead for the data


00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:08.400
management system, that's going to be accepting and processing


00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:11.920
and distributing all of the data that we're getting from one of


00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:14.400
the next big telescopes, the Nancy Gace Roman Space


00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:21.080
telescope. So my day-to-day job is making sure that all that is designed and


00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:24.800
functioning and data is flowing through and the software we're gonna write for


00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:29.520
scientists to do analysis of that data you know will run and is appropriate and


00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:34.920
accessible. That's kind of my that's my day-to-day. Before that I worked heavily


00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:41.520
on post pipeline scientific analysis processing software so visualization


00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:49.280
tools, data analysis tools, things that really the astronomy community uses after we've constructed


00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:56.560
the data for them from the telescope. Okay. Tell us just a little bit about the data


00:06:56.560 --> 00:07:02.400
story of this. There must be a lot of data coming off of these newer telescopes with their


00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:03.520
huge resolution.


00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:07.920
- Yeah, so there is a lot of data coming down.


00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:12.920
The detectors onboard JWST are 2000 pixels by 2000 pixels.


00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:17.120
And there's a lot of them and there's a lot of instruments.


00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:18.960
And so we have to be able to manage


00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:21.120
all of that data stream coming through.


00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:23.680
And I might let Mike talk a little bit here


00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:26.440
since he works heavily on the upside of the house,


00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:29.080
helping with managing that data.


00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:31.040
- All right, Mike, yeah, take it away.


00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:32.200
And what's your role?


00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:34.600
at STSI.


00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:35.720
My role is--


00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:36.880
Yeah, it is.


00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:39.360
A team lead for the data processing team,


00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:40.160
also a scrum lead.


00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:44.240
We use the Agile approach to software development.


00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:47.880
And I'm focused completely on JWST science data processing


00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:49.240
and Guider data processing.


00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:53.680
The data comes down to us through the Deep Space


00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:56.720
Network of NASA and hits the ground


00:07:56.720 --> 00:07:58.500
and comes up to us at Baltimore.


00:07:58.500 --> 00:08:00.540
We have the control center right in the building,


00:08:00.540 --> 00:08:02.920
They're actually talking to the observatory


00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:05.020
right through our main building.


00:08:05.020 --> 00:08:07.300
And then the data feeds down to our processing systems.


00:08:07.300 --> 00:08:10.020
And that's where my code comes in,


00:08:10.020 --> 00:08:11.620
making sure we got all the data,


00:08:11.620 --> 00:08:14.120
completeness checking,


00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:16.380
sending the data through the pipelines


00:08:16.380 --> 00:08:19.340
and the processing systems with the right processing recipe


00:08:19.340 --> 00:08:21.900
so that we get the right kind of data products out


00:08:21.900 --> 00:08:23.080
and getting them into our archive.


00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:26.940
The Institute has a well-known archive for astronomy data.


00:08:26.940 --> 00:08:29.740
And that's where a lot of astronomers come to do research


00:08:29.740 --> 00:08:32.580
and find data sets that they can use in their science.


00:08:32.580 --> 00:08:33.420
- Fantastic.


00:08:33.420 --> 00:08:35.180
A lot of that data is public, right?


00:08:35.180 --> 00:08:37.420
- It is, it is very much so.


00:08:37.420 --> 00:08:41.700
There's a proprietary period for some kinds of data


00:08:41.700 --> 00:08:43.060
so that scientists have a chance


00:08:43.060 --> 00:08:46.980
to write their special papers that they proposed for.


00:08:46.980 --> 00:08:49.460
But a lot of data is maybe immediately public


00:08:49.460 --> 00:08:53.100
and then other data becomes public after a bit of a while.


00:08:53.100 --> 00:08:57.180
- Interesting, so you might write a proposal


00:08:57.180 --> 00:09:02.180
for time on web or one of the telescopes.


00:09:02.180 --> 00:09:04.780
And then if that's approved, then you get your time,


00:09:04.780 --> 00:09:05.620
then you get your data.


00:09:05.620 --> 00:09:06.900
And of course it would make sense


00:09:06.900 --> 00:09:08.260
to just instantly publish that


00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:12.260
because that's part of your work, right?


00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:15.140
- Yeah, and so this is actually,


00:09:15.140 --> 00:09:17.700
you know, pieces of the entire process.


00:09:17.700 --> 00:09:20.460
The whole world of astronomers is allowed to propose


00:09:20.460 --> 00:09:23.920
to use these telescopes, so Hubble and JWST.


00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:28.220
And there's a telescope review process that happens


00:09:28.220 --> 00:09:30.040
where they submit their suggestions.


00:09:30.040 --> 00:09:31.080
This is what I wanna do.


00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:32.700
This is how awesome the data is gonna be.


00:09:32.700 --> 00:09:34.460
This is what I'm gonna provide to the community


00:09:34.460 --> 00:09:36.580
and the discoveries I think I'll make.


00:09:36.580 --> 00:09:40.180
And a team of experts, you know, agrees


00:09:40.180 --> 00:09:42.800
and decides how much time everybody is gonna get.


00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:46.520
And we have a lot of tools on what you might think of


00:09:46.520 --> 00:09:50.500
as the front end of this process to help them figure out,


00:09:50.500 --> 00:09:52.960
you know, how long do the observations have to be


00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:55.960
if I'm looking through these filters and these wavelengths,


00:09:55.960 --> 00:09:58.240
what kind of errors am I gonna get?


00:09:58.240 --> 00:09:59.280
What's the exposure time?


00:09:59.280 --> 00:10:03.200
How should I most effectively use the telescope time


00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:04.460
to get the science out?


00:10:04.460 --> 00:10:08.040
Because telescope time is always, it's gold, right?


00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:08.960
- Right, absolutely.


00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:11.840
It's one and only one of these things, right?


00:10:11.840 --> 00:10:13.440
- Yeah. - This particular one.


00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:16.940
I didn't really think about that you,


00:10:16.940 --> 00:10:19.280
for asking different types of questions,


00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:22.680
there was a different amount of time that you might need.


00:10:22.680 --> 00:10:26.200
Obviously, if you're going to stare at space for a certain amount of time, it's going to take that


00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:31.560
time. But I hadn't really thought about the different processing pipelines might require


00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:36.040
more data to get the right level of accuracy and stuff. That's pretty interesting.


00:10:36.040 --> 00:10:41.640
Yeah. So it really does depend on what you want to get out of it. When you observe in different


00:10:41.640 --> 00:10:47.240
wavelengths, you have to look at those things for a long enough amount of time to collect the light,


00:10:47.880 --> 00:10:53.800
to get statistical certainty, to get detections. But then you have to play that against the fact


00:10:53.800 --> 00:10:58.600
that as you look longer and deeper, your field might get more crowded because you'll be able


00:10:58.600 --> 00:11:06.840
to pick up light from more distant objects. You may have things that are called cosmic rays,


00:11:06.840 --> 00:11:12.280
extra energy that gets added into the detector that you don't want, that's not from your object,


00:11:12.280 --> 00:11:16.600
that's just messing up your data. And the pipelines take these things into account.


00:11:16.600 --> 00:11:20.680
we look for things that are, oh, this is not coming from the object. This is coming from


00:11:20.680 --> 00:11:27.880
something in space that we don't want to detect right now, or something that is being imparted


00:11:27.880 --> 00:11:32.120
by the instrument onto the data, and we want to remove the instrumental signature. So that's what


00:11:32.120 --> 00:11:37.320
a lot of the processing software tries to look at. Yeah, fantastic. Mike, anything you want to


00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:41.960
add to that? Just one other kind of data is time-dependent data. You may need to look at


00:11:41.960 --> 00:11:48.280
objects over time, either calendar time or even many hours or many days, to see variability.


00:11:48.280 --> 00:11:52.760
And that's a big part of some of the datasets is they just stretch on for time so that you


00:11:52.760 --> 00:11:57.920
can look for planetary transits or flares or various phenomena that might vary over


00:11:57.920 --> 00:11:58.920
time.


00:11:58.920 --> 00:11:59.920
Yeah.


00:11:59.920 --> 00:12:00.920
How interesting.


00:12:00.920 --> 00:12:08.080
One of the goals that Webb is trying to solve is to detect exoplanets, right?


00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:11.560
For those, you've got to watch multiple years


00:12:11.560 --> 00:12:14.280
of whatever that planet's year orbital time is, right?


00:12:14.280 --> 00:12:16.240
If it takes it three months to go around,


00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:17.520
you've got to watch the star


00:12:17.520 --> 00:12:20.720
for several three-month periods, right?


00:12:20.720 --> 00:12:22.720
- Well, and even in the case that you don't know


00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:25.320
that the stars have planets, you want to find new ones.


00:12:25.320 --> 00:12:28.400
You need to go back and look at that star multiple times


00:12:28.400 --> 00:12:30.860
so that you can detect that difference


00:12:30.860 --> 00:12:32.200
in the light that it's emitting.


00:12:32.200 --> 00:12:35.040
So when the planet goes across the star,


00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:37.640
some light is going to be dimmed by that.


00:12:37.640 --> 00:12:39.760
Or if you're looking at spectroscopy,


00:12:39.760 --> 00:12:42.160
you might see the starlight passing


00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:45.200
through the atmosphere of the planet itself.


00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:46.760
Yeah, fantastic.


00:12:46.760 --> 00:12:49.480
All right, I want to dive into the Python side,


00:12:49.480 --> 00:12:51.720
given that that's what most people are interested in.


00:12:51.720 --> 00:12:54.120
But before we get into that, let's just


00:12:54.120 --> 00:12:58.440
talk real briefly about what are some of the science missions


00:12:58.440 --> 00:13:01.600
and how is this different than Hubble?


00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:04.080
It looks really different than Hubble, right?


00:13:04.080 --> 00:13:07.860
It's this bunch of hexagon gold plates


00:13:07.860 --> 00:13:10.600
that unfold instead of being a tube like a traditional,


00:13:10.600 --> 00:13:14.640
even the space telescope like Hubble is.


00:13:14.640 --> 00:13:19.080
It's got a tennis court-sized shield around it and stuff.


00:13:19.080 --> 00:13:23.640
So whoever wants to jump in, tell us a bit about what


00:13:23.640 --> 00:13:26.600
is the goal and the science of Webb?


00:13:26.600 --> 00:13:27.960
You made it a science side better.


00:13:27.960 --> 00:13:28.880
Why don't you go ahead?


00:13:28.880 --> 00:13:29.520
[LAUGHTER]


00:13:29.520 --> 00:13:30.240
I don't know.


00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:30.880
You can pick up.


00:13:30.880 --> 00:13:33.960
I'll do some, and you pick in.


00:13:33.960 --> 00:13:37.920
Yeah, so Webb is really the largest space telescope.


00:13:37.920 --> 00:13:41.360
It does have segmented mirrors, 18 of them,


00:13:41.360 --> 00:13:45.600
that can be adjusted to make sure that the focus is good.


00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:47.400
It's something like six meters across.


00:13:47.400 --> 00:13:48.240
It's really big.


00:13:48.240 --> 00:13:51.360
It's 6 and 1/2 meters across the mirror.


00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:56.560
I think it's something like 21 feet in diameter,


00:13:56.560 --> 00:13:59.680
something like that.


00:13:59.680 --> 00:14:02.160
One of the things that makes it different from Hubble


00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:03.900
is not only the size of the mirror


00:14:03.900 --> 00:14:07.420
and the size of the telescope, but Hubble orbits the Earth.


00:14:07.420 --> 00:14:12.100
And JWST is demonstrably not orbiting the Earth.


00:14:12.100 --> 00:14:14.260
It's not very close at all.


00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:16.660
It's out at the second Lagrangian point, which


00:14:16.660 --> 00:14:22.100
is a more stable point that things orbiting in the Earth's


00:14:22.100 --> 00:14:25.620
sun system tend to collect at.


00:14:25.620 --> 00:14:27.500
And it's not even at that point.


00:14:27.500 --> 00:14:31.460
It's orbiting around that point and facing away from the Earth.


00:14:31.460 --> 00:14:34.180
And so one of the things that's really important for Webb


00:14:34.180 --> 00:14:36.700
is that it stays cool, that its instruments stay cool.


00:14:36.700 --> 00:14:39.500
And that's why it has this big sun shield.


00:14:39.500 --> 00:14:42.180
And so the cold side of the telescope


00:14:42.180 --> 00:14:44.180
is where we have all of our instrument packages.


00:14:44.180 --> 00:14:47.660
And that allows it to pick up this infrared wavelength


00:14:47.660 --> 00:14:50.700
of light, which is sensitive to heat.


00:14:50.700 --> 00:14:52.620
And it allows it to do the science


00:14:52.620 --> 00:14:55.240
that we need to do to look at dust and look through dust


00:14:55.240 --> 00:14:58.820
and look all the way back to the very earliest time


00:14:58.820 --> 00:15:04.220
just after the Big Bang when light was starting to be visible,


00:15:04.220 --> 00:15:08.660
to collect and start to form objects and stuff like that.


00:15:08.660 --> 00:15:10.620
So the design of the telescope is very much


00:15:10.620 --> 00:15:14.340
to enable the science that's possible with it.


00:15:14.340 --> 00:15:15.940
And Hubble uses visible light?


00:15:15.940 --> 00:15:16.900
Is that the difference?


00:15:16.900 --> 00:15:18.180
So Hubble has a range.


00:15:18.180 --> 00:15:21.460
Hubble actually has instrumentation


00:15:21.460 --> 00:15:26.060
that looks at uv, visible, and then near infrared.


00:15:26.060 --> 00:15:29.100
So it has a little bit of everything.


00:15:29.100 --> 00:15:31.380
JWST also looks at near-infrared,


00:15:31.380 --> 00:15:35.180
but it goes much further out into the mid-infrared as well.


00:15:35.180 --> 00:15:38.100
And I guess that goes through dust clouds and things


00:15:38.100 --> 00:15:39.100
like that better?


00:15:39.100 --> 00:15:39.780
It can.


00:15:39.780 --> 00:15:42.780
So you can switch between the different wavelengths


00:15:42.780 --> 00:15:46.820
of light depending on what types of phenomena you want to see.


00:15:46.820 --> 00:15:51.300
But also, because we want to look very far back in time,


00:15:51.300 --> 00:15:53.820
what happens and what enables us to do that


00:15:53.820 --> 00:15:55.620
is the redshifting of the light.


00:15:55.620 --> 00:15:58.820
So because after the Big Bang and the expansion


00:15:58.820 --> 00:16:00.980
of the universe, the light gets stretched


00:16:00.980 --> 00:16:04.500
by the expansion of space, to look back in time,


00:16:04.500 --> 00:16:06.160
you want to look at the light that


00:16:06.160 --> 00:16:08.460
is of that similar wavelength that's been stretched.


00:16:08.460 --> 00:16:10.940
So that's why we're looking in the infrared wavelengths.


00:16:10.940 --> 00:16:12.140
OK, interesting.


00:16:12.140 --> 00:16:14.700
Yeah, it comes from visible down to infrared


00:16:14.700 --> 00:16:17.220
as it shifts back in time?


00:16:17.220 --> 00:16:18.900
If it was blue-- no, it goes--


00:16:18.900 --> 00:16:22.100
It's moving away, so it's stretching out


00:16:22.100 --> 00:16:24.180
redder and redder and redder.


00:16:24.180 --> 00:16:27.260
So generally, in redshift, if it's coming towards you,


00:16:27.260 --> 00:16:29.780
it gets blue, or the wavelengths get shorter.


00:16:29.780 --> 00:16:31.900
As it's going away, the wavelengths get longer.


00:16:31.900 --> 00:16:34.820
Yeah, got it.


00:16:34.820 --> 00:16:36.620
So what are some of the missions?


00:16:36.620 --> 00:16:38.060
I talked about the--


00:16:38.060 --> 00:16:41.660
we talked about the exoplanet a bit.


00:16:41.660 --> 00:16:46.780
Exoplanets, galaxy history, evolution.


00:16:46.780 --> 00:16:48.260
Star formation.


00:16:48.260 --> 00:16:51.900
Star formation, looking at the chemical composition


00:16:51.900 --> 00:16:53.700
of the galaxies.


00:16:53.700 --> 00:16:54.420
and of stars.


00:16:54.420 --> 00:16:56.500
So it really uses this combination


00:16:56.500 --> 00:17:00.220
of spectroscopy, imaging, and coronagraphy.


00:17:00.220 --> 00:17:03.260
And coronagraphy is excellent for exoplanets


00:17:03.260 --> 00:17:05.860
because it allows you to basically put


00:17:05.860 --> 00:17:08.600
a stopper in front of the star and look


00:17:08.600 --> 00:17:12.260
for really, really dim things that are very close to it.


00:17:12.260 --> 00:17:13.100
Yeah.


00:17:13.100 --> 00:17:15.660
Because solar system objects as well, and even things out


00:17:15.660 --> 00:17:20.940
in the comet work cloud, and things that we just can't see.


00:17:20.940 --> 00:17:23.260
We don't have anything that can get out there


00:17:23.260 --> 00:17:26.380
in the infrared like this telescope will be able to.


00:17:26.380 --> 00:17:30.340
Yeah, that's going to be super exciting.


00:17:30.340 --> 00:17:34.380
Hubble really changed people's view of the world, right?


00:17:34.380 --> 00:17:38.540
Seeing all the-- like the sky full of galaxies and stuff


00:17:38.540 --> 00:17:39.860
like that.


00:17:39.860 --> 00:17:42.460
What do you think we're going to learn?


00:17:42.460 --> 00:17:44.060
I mean, maybe it's too hard to predict.


00:17:44.060 --> 00:17:46.020
But what do you think is going to be surprising?


00:17:46.020 --> 00:17:47.740
Or what types of things do you think


00:17:47.740 --> 00:17:51.820
we're going to learn and change our perspective with this?


00:17:51.820 --> 00:17:53.820
I guess what I hear from most of the scientists


00:17:53.820 --> 00:17:58.020
is they know they're going to find out things that they never


00:17:58.020 --> 00:18:00.180
even thought of, because that's what Hubble brought.


00:18:00.180 --> 00:18:02.940
And when you put something up that's this groundbreaking,


00:18:02.940 --> 00:18:07.380
that it goes so far beyond what we can currently do,


00:18:07.380 --> 00:18:09.720
there's going to be just surprises that are just


00:18:09.720 --> 00:18:12.060
going to blow people's minds, because they did not think


00:18:12.060 --> 00:18:13.660
that things were even possible.


00:18:13.660 --> 00:18:15.740
Hubble basically was involved in finding


00:18:15.740 --> 00:18:18.940
the acceleration of the universe, expansion.


00:18:18.940 --> 00:18:20.500
And that wasn't even conceived of.


00:18:20.500 --> 00:18:24.560
So things that are groundbreaking and just never


00:18:24.560 --> 00:18:27.520
thought of, the astronomers are open to those.


00:18:27.520 --> 00:18:29.280
And they're waiting for the data to come in


00:18:29.280 --> 00:18:30.920
to start to get to look.


00:18:30.920 --> 00:18:32.280
Yeah, fantastic.


00:18:32.280 --> 00:18:32.760
All right.


00:18:32.760 --> 00:18:38.240
Speaking of data, let's start talking about that side, Mike.


00:18:38.240 --> 00:18:42.600
You said the data comes in over the deep space network?


00:18:42.600 --> 00:18:43.440
Is that--


00:18:43.440 --> 00:18:45.240
Yeah, NASA's deep space network.


00:18:45.240 --> 00:18:48.720
Yeah, so maybe tell us about the kind of data coming in


00:18:48.720 --> 00:18:51.100
and how that all works.


00:18:51.100 --> 00:18:52.060
Sure.


00:18:52.060 --> 00:18:54.280
So the Deep Space Network is what we use


00:18:54.280 --> 00:18:55.980
to talk to the observatory.


00:18:55.980 --> 00:18:58.780
We get a couple contacts-- well, eventually,


00:18:58.780 --> 00:19:00.320
when it's in steady state operations,


00:19:00.320 --> 00:19:02.320
we'll get a couple contacts a day where it'll


00:19:02.320 --> 00:19:03.400
download the data to us.


00:19:03.400 --> 00:19:06.560
Right now, we're in fairly steady contact.


00:19:06.560 --> 00:19:08.920
There are three ground stations around the world--


00:19:08.920 --> 00:19:12.000
in Australia, California, and Spain--


00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:16.160
that kind of give nearly continuous coverage.


00:19:16.160 --> 00:19:18.000
And so they're getting the data down.


00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:19.340
It comes down through the beams.


00:19:19.340 --> 00:19:22.220
>> What kind of bandwidth can you get on this network?


00:19:22.220 --> 00:19:23.700
>> Oh, that I don't know.


00:19:23.700 --> 00:19:25.940
I don't have this maybe certain idea.


00:19:25.940 --> 00:19:28.660
>> Yeah, these networks are big antennas.


00:19:28.660 --> 00:19:31.100
And we share this with other missions,


00:19:31.100 --> 00:19:34.260
with other things that are in space that need to communicate.


00:19:34.260 --> 00:19:35.180
>> Mars rovers and what?


00:19:35.180 --> 00:19:36.940
>> Like Mars rovers and stuff.


00:19:36.940 --> 00:19:43.700
And they typically operate in the KA and S band regions.


00:19:43.700 --> 00:19:44.820
>> Yeah, cool.


00:19:44.820 --> 00:19:46.260
All right, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to derail you, Mike.


00:19:46.260 --> 00:19:46.660
Go ahead.


00:19:46.660 --> 00:19:47.660
>> No, all good.


00:19:47.660 --> 00:19:50.260
So the data comes down to the Deep Space Network facilities.


00:19:50.260 --> 00:19:52.980
It gets transferred up to the Institute,


00:19:52.980 --> 00:19:56.880
which is in Baltimore, to our flight ops team, the flight


00:19:56.880 --> 00:19:58.820
observation system.


00:19:58.820 --> 00:20:00.860
They get the data in several forms.


00:20:00.860 --> 00:20:04.780
They get binary files right off the flight data recorders.


00:20:04.780 --> 00:20:08.000
There's a recorder that captures both science data


00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:10.280
from the science instruments and engineering data that's


00:20:10.280 --> 00:20:12.820
monitoring the state of the telescope temperatures


00:20:12.820 --> 00:20:14.940
and pressures and various things.


00:20:14.940 --> 00:20:15.780
Right, of course.


00:20:15.780 --> 00:20:17.060
Because there's all that data--


00:20:17.060 --> 00:20:21.460
are going, it's focused, right? It's still running, things like that.


00:20:21.460 --> 00:20:26.260
Absolutely. Yeah, they have to, health and safety of the observatory and then the science as well.


00:20:26.260 --> 00:20:32.420
So we get those binary files that come up, we get auxiliary files that are processed on the ground,


00:20:32.420 --> 00:20:36.900
we take the engineering data that comes down, extract out some really key parameters that are


00:20:36.900 --> 00:20:42.580
necessary for the data processing and put those in special files and send those over to our data


00:20:42.580 --> 00:20:45.140
processing system, along with kind of a summary of what the


00:20:45.140 --> 00:20:48.220
telescope was doing since we last contacted. So we know,


00:20:48.220 --> 00:20:51.380
observe these things, and these, these observations worked,


00:20:51.380 --> 00:20:55.140
these had problems, gives us kind of a status of things. And


00:20:55.140 --> 00:20:56.780
the other kind of data that we absolutely need is called


00:20:56.780 --> 00:20:59.620
ephemeris data, it tells us exactly where the telescope was


00:20:59.620 --> 00:21:03.100
at any given time, which can be important for some types of


00:21:03.100 --> 00:21:07.140
science. Yeah, so all that data flows our way in files, we use


00:21:07.140 --> 00:21:12.660
Python tasks to pull a common disk area that files are


00:21:12.660 --> 00:21:15.380
dumped in and pick them up and transfer them


00:21:15.380 --> 00:21:16.380
to our processing system.


00:21:16.380 --> 00:21:18.060
So the telescopes receive the data.


00:21:18.060 --> 00:21:20.140
That gets processed probably at the--


00:21:20.140 --> 00:21:23.100
not the telescope, the--


00:21:23.100 --> 00:21:23.820
Ground station.


00:21:23.820 --> 00:21:24.460
Ground station.


00:21:24.460 --> 00:21:25.060
They receive it.


00:21:25.060 --> 00:21:25.420
Yeah.


00:21:25.420 --> 00:21:27.700
And then that gets sent probably over the internet,


00:21:27.700 --> 00:21:31.060
gets dropped into some local file or some cloud storage.


00:21:31.060 --> 00:21:34.260
You're watching that, and then Python picks it up from there?


00:21:34.260 --> 00:21:34.820
That's right.


00:21:34.820 --> 00:21:35.460
That's right.


00:21:35.460 --> 00:21:36.220
We pick it up.


00:21:36.220 --> 00:21:38.820
We segregate what kind of data each is,


00:21:38.820 --> 00:21:40.680
send it on for various kinds of processing.


00:21:40.680 --> 00:21:42.480
We put a lot of those data files right


00:21:42.480 --> 00:21:44.440
as they come in the door in our archive.


00:21:44.440 --> 00:21:47.820
So if we need to get them back out to look at them later,


00:21:47.820 --> 00:21:49.640
we can.


00:21:49.640 --> 00:21:53.000
We use a system for distributing the processing


00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:54.480
called HT Condor.


00:21:54.480 --> 00:21:57.640
It's made by the University of Wisconsin.


00:21:57.640 --> 00:21:59.320
And it lets us distribute the processing


00:21:59.320 --> 00:22:02.440
over a big network of machines.


00:22:02.440 --> 00:22:05.160
This was developed even before the cloud came into being.


00:22:05.160 --> 00:22:08.160
Now the cloud's just part of it.


00:22:08.160 --> 00:22:09.800
So we use that system to span out


00:22:09.800 --> 00:22:13.080
the data processing of these various types of files.


00:22:13.080 --> 00:22:15.840
And we have a lot of data completeness checking


00:22:15.840 --> 00:22:18.920
that we do in Python, where we got to register what came in,


00:22:18.920 --> 00:22:20.200
whether we got all the packets.


00:22:20.200 --> 00:22:21.800
The data can come in different orders.


00:22:21.800 --> 00:22:23.880
It can be split up different ways in the recorder.


00:22:23.880 --> 00:22:26.040
And you have to do a bunch of data accounting


00:22:26.040 --> 00:22:28.360
before you can send it down the pipeline for processing,


00:22:28.360 --> 00:22:30.120
because otherwise you'll have holes in it,


00:22:30.120 --> 00:22:32.280
and the processing won't give you the best product.


00:22:32.280 --> 00:22:35.880
So we do all that pre-data accounting analysis.


00:22:35.880 --> 00:22:38.000
And when we've got something that's got all the parts,


00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:39.800
we send it on down the pipeline


00:22:39.800 --> 00:22:41.680
with a particular processing recipe


00:22:41.680 --> 00:22:42.560
that tells the pipeline


00:22:42.560 --> 00:22:45.280
to apply these exact calibration recipes,


00:22:45.280 --> 00:22:47.200
make these exact kinds of files


00:22:47.200 --> 00:22:48.380
and get them into our archive


00:22:48.380 --> 00:22:51.240
for the scientists to retrieve and do science with.


00:22:51.240 --> 00:22:52.400
- Oh, that's really interesting.


00:22:52.400 --> 00:22:55.120
So you're doing some of the error checks


00:22:55.120 --> 00:22:57.800
and all that kind of data cleaning stuff for them


00:22:57.800 --> 00:23:00.040
before they have to pick it up.


00:23:00.040 --> 00:23:01.540
- Well, we also need to check to make sure


00:23:01.540 --> 00:23:03.800
that there wasn't an error in the transmission of the data,


00:23:03.800 --> 00:23:05.880
that we got everything off the telescope


00:23:05.880 --> 00:23:08.000
that we thought we were gonna get,


00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:10.900
whether things need to be retransmitted.


00:23:10.900 --> 00:23:12.640
And we're recording all the information


00:23:12.640 --> 00:23:15.620
about the instrumentation surrounding the detectors,


00:23:15.620 --> 00:23:17.400
what the temperatures are on the telescope,


00:23:17.400 --> 00:23:20.000
and saving that and associating it with the data


00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:23.140
so that when scientists are looking at it,


00:23:23.140 --> 00:23:25.000
they can make correlations


00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:26.960
with the different things that they see.


00:23:26.960 --> 00:23:27.800
- Oh, nice.


00:23:27.800 --> 00:23:30.380
We've got Teddy out in the audience has a question


00:23:30.380 --> 00:23:33.300
that's pretty related to that.


00:23:33.300 --> 00:23:36.500
How do you manage potential disruption in data transfer,


00:23:36.500 --> 00:23:39.060
like if you lose the connection?


00:23:39.060 --> 00:23:41.380
Do you all have to worry about that, or is it handled--


00:23:41.380 --> 00:23:41.880
like below?


00:23:41.880 --> 00:23:42.380
We do.


00:23:42.380 --> 00:23:42.880
We do.


00:23:42.880 --> 00:23:43.860
It does happen.


00:23:43.860 --> 00:23:46.180
It is handled upstream from us.


00:23:46.180 --> 00:23:48.700
The Deep Space Network has that capability,


00:23:48.700 --> 00:23:50.700
and our flight ops team has to get them sometimes


00:23:50.700 --> 00:23:51.940
to retransmit the data.


00:23:51.940 --> 00:23:53.540
If we got it on the ground, but we just


00:23:53.540 --> 00:23:54.980
didn't get it to our institute, we


00:23:54.980 --> 00:23:57.100
can get it resent from another ground station.


00:23:57.100 --> 00:23:59.180
But if it really didn't make it all the way down


00:23:59.180 --> 00:24:00.600
from the observatory, then they've


00:24:00.600 --> 00:24:02.520
got to go back on the next contact pass


00:24:02.520 --> 00:24:04.760
and get it to retransmit to the ground.


00:24:04.760 --> 00:24:10.160
Yeah, so there must be some kind of protocol exchange


00:24:10.160 --> 00:24:13.000
over the deep space network that sort of takes care of that


00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:13.880
for you.


00:24:13.880 --> 00:24:14.600
Yep, yep.


00:24:14.600 --> 00:24:16.440
And as Megan said, that's a shared resource.


00:24:16.440 --> 00:24:18.480
So if they happen to be talking to the Mars Rover


00:24:18.480 --> 00:24:20.760
or they happen to be talking to something else,


00:24:20.760 --> 00:24:22.920
we've got to get in line with everyone else


00:24:22.920 --> 00:24:24.200
till we get our turn again.


00:24:24.200 --> 00:24:25.400
Sure.


00:24:25.400 --> 00:24:27.920
Also related to that is, what's the latency


00:24:27.920 --> 00:24:29.560
between the first piece of data sent


00:24:29.560 --> 00:24:30.700
and the first one received.


00:24:30.700 --> 00:24:33.640
I mean, we are at great distances


00:24:33.640 --> 00:24:34.960
talking about the speed of,


00:24:34.960 --> 00:24:36.480
limited by the speed of light, right?


00:24:36.480 --> 00:24:41.480
So it's not milliseconds, I'm sure.


00:24:41.480 --> 00:24:45.360
- Megan, do you recall what the travel time to LT was?


00:24:45.360 --> 00:24:46.720
I don't recall, honestly.


00:24:46.720 --> 00:24:48.720
- I don't know, probably by the time we get it,


00:24:48.720 --> 00:24:52.660
we're talking minutes, some range of minutes,


00:24:52.660 --> 00:24:55.520
but I haven't calculated it recently.


00:24:55.520 --> 00:24:57.600
- Yeah, yeah, very interesting.


00:24:57.600 --> 00:24:59.520
I mean, when we talk about data, you


00:24:59.520 --> 00:25:01.720
may take pictures with your camera,


00:25:01.720 --> 00:25:03.440
with a CCD in your camera, and you'll


00:25:03.440 --> 00:25:05.460
see that picture immediately.


00:25:05.460 --> 00:25:07.960
And it's a square, and it looks like the scene that you got.


00:25:07.960 --> 00:25:09.580
But when Mike was talking about, we're


00:25:09.580 --> 00:25:12.000
waiting for the pieces of the data to come,


00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:14.400
that square gets chopped up on board the telescope


00:25:14.400 --> 00:25:16.040
and sent to us in little tiny pieces,


00:25:16.040 --> 00:25:18.320
and we have to reconstruct it.


00:25:18.320 --> 00:25:19.240
Yeah.


00:25:19.240 --> 00:25:22.080
The other part of that analogy is, if you hold your camera up


00:25:22.080 --> 00:25:24.520
and you take a picture of the sky, it's just a picture.


00:25:24.520 --> 00:25:26.920
We add all kinds of what we call metadata,


00:25:26.920 --> 00:25:30.360
supplementary data to that image that tells where it was pointed


00:25:30.360 --> 00:25:32.880
in the sky, what filters were in use on the observatory,


00:25:32.880 --> 00:25:35.880
what astronomer asked for this data, what data grouping is it


00:25:35.880 --> 00:25:36.880
part of.


00:25:36.880 --> 00:25:39.320
They do groupings in what they call proposals.


00:25:39.320 --> 00:25:40.880
And so we have all this extra data


00:25:40.880 --> 00:25:45.120
that we put into the files so that someone coming


00:25:45.120 --> 00:25:47.680
in to our archive who didn't propose the data


00:25:47.680 --> 00:25:50.240
can still extract it and get some understanding of what


00:25:50.240 --> 00:25:54.080
was done, how that piece of observation was set up.


00:25:54.080 --> 00:25:55.880
- Sure, of course, because if somebody says,


00:25:55.880 --> 00:25:59.360
here's a directory full of large JPEGs.


00:25:59.360 --> 00:26:01.360
- Exactly. - It takes seconds now, right?


00:26:01.360 --> 00:26:03.840
- They're beautiful and they're almost useless.


00:26:03.840 --> 00:26:04.960
Yeah, with alpha metadata,


00:26:04.960 --> 00:26:06.960
they're almost useless for science.


00:26:06.960 --> 00:26:08.000
- Yeah, absolutely.


00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:10.640
They would still make a good coffee table book though,


00:26:10.640 --> 00:26:12.140
probably.


00:26:12.140 --> 00:26:13.960
- Once they were cleaned up of the cosmic rays


00:26:13.960 --> 00:26:16.520
and all those things that Megan talked about.


00:26:16.520 --> 00:26:19.600
- And once you combine all the multiple filter images,


00:26:19.600 --> 00:26:21.440
you get the pretty colors.


00:26:21.440 --> 00:26:22.280
- Yeah, I bet.


00:26:22.280 --> 00:26:23.420
Yeah, those are amazing.


00:26:23.420 --> 00:26:37.420
Sam Paria asks, "What's the max onboard storage in case the data, if there's an extended period where you can't get to it? How long will this thing run before it's just hard drive fills up?"


00:26:37.420 --> 00:26:41.420
Meg, do you remember the capacity for the recorder?


00:26:41.420 --> 00:26:45.420
I know because I have Roman in my head right now, so I don't remember the JWST capacity.


00:26:45.420 --> 00:26:50.140
but they take that into account and that's how they've scheduled our contacts and downlinks with


00:26:50.140 --> 00:26:57.420
the Deep Space Network so that we can get the data off in a reasonable time and it's not affecting


00:26:57.420 --> 00:27:02.460
you know scheduling of new observations. So they've done a lot of work and a lot of the work


00:27:02.460 --> 00:27:07.020
that we've done with Hubble in the last 30 years because we do scheduling and data processing on


00:27:07.020 --> 00:27:13.740
Hubble has allowed us to understand how to best optimize those types of things. Yeah very


00:27:13.740 --> 00:27:14.540
Very interesting.


00:27:14.540 --> 00:27:16.540
You must have a lot of experience from Hubble


00:27:16.540 --> 00:27:18.620
because that's a lot of data as well.


00:27:18.620 --> 00:27:20.900
I was wondering how much computing


00:27:20.900 --> 00:27:24.140
happens on the telescope versus how much is it just


00:27:24.140 --> 00:27:27.380
a receptor and a transmitter?


00:27:27.380 --> 00:27:29.760
There is a little bit that happens on board JDMST,


00:27:29.760 --> 00:27:31.980
especially in the instruments.


00:27:31.980 --> 00:27:33.920
Meg probably knows more of the details of some


00:27:33.920 --> 00:27:35.260
of the infrared instruments.


00:27:35.260 --> 00:27:39.340
But they do image differencing and summations.


00:27:39.340 --> 00:27:42.380
Infrared detectors build up their signal over time.


00:27:42.380 --> 00:27:45.560
And rather than send all those bits to the ground,


00:27:45.560 --> 00:27:48.600
there are some on-board calculations


00:27:48.600 --> 00:27:51.280
that are done so that they send a bit less to the ground


00:27:51.280 --> 00:27:53.240
than they actually collected.


00:27:53.240 --> 00:27:53.720
Yeah.


00:27:53.720 --> 00:27:57.040
So one of the things that's different about IR instruments


00:27:57.040 --> 00:28:01.160
than UViz CCDs is that we don't--


00:28:01.160 --> 00:28:04.400
every time-- there's no shutter in the IR.


00:28:04.400 --> 00:28:07.440
Every time we want to know what the detector is collecting,


00:28:07.440 --> 00:28:09.200
we kind of ask it really nicely.


00:28:09.200 --> 00:28:11.120
What's the voltage at this pixel?


00:28:11.120 --> 00:28:14.080
Then we ask it again, and we ask it a whole bunch more times.


00:28:14.080 --> 00:28:15.960
And that's the data that we send down.


00:28:15.960 --> 00:28:20.280
And knowing how that signal is accumulating in the pixel


00:28:20.280 --> 00:28:23.640
without removing the signal from the pixel


00:28:23.640 --> 00:28:26.680
allows us to do cool things with IR data that


00:28:26.680 --> 00:28:29.120
allow us to reject the cosmic rays that


00:28:29.120 --> 00:28:32.680
may have come during the course of the exposure and stuff


00:28:32.680 --> 00:28:33.680
like that.


00:28:33.680 --> 00:28:34.400
Nice.


00:28:34.400 --> 00:28:36.680
Do you have to do stabilization?


00:28:36.680 --> 00:28:39.080
I know the thing is probably pretty stable out there,


00:28:39.080 --> 00:28:41.080
but it's also looking really far away.


00:28:41.080 --> 00:28:45.580
- Stabilization, yeah, it is looking far away


00:28:45.580 --> 00:28:48.380
and it is mostly stable.


00:28:48.380 --> 00:28:50.360
Where it is orbiting around L2


00:28:50.360 --> 00:28:53.020
is not a completely stable orbit.


00:28:53.020 --> 00:28:56.100
And so they do have to do station keeping,


00:28:56.100 --> 00:28:58.840
which I believe fires rockets


00:28:58.840 --> 00:29:01.840
to make sure that it's in the correct orbit.


00:29:01.840 --> 00:29:04.800
- And one of the big pieces of news that was really great


00:29:04.800 --> 00:29:07.040
was ESA, the European Space Agency,


00:29:07.040 --> 00:29:10.320
who launched this did an excellent job


00:29:10.320 --> 00:29:11.720
of getting it right on target.


00:29:11.720 --> 00:29:13.000
So it didn't have to correct much,


00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:16.360
which means it has extra fuel to run longer to do that.


00:29:16.360 --> 00:29:17.280
- Exactly.


00:29:17.280 --> 00:29:19.940
They did an amazing job with that launch.


00:29:19.940 --> 00:29:21.760
That was like a flawless launch.


00:29:21.760 --> 00:29:23.720
It was really, really cool.


00:29:23.720 --> 00:29:24.800
- Fantastic.


00:29:24.800 --> 00:29:26.160
All right, a real-time follow-up.


00:29:26.160 --> 00:29:27.760
We've got Adam on the audience says,


00:29:27.760 --> 00:29:31.280
"JWST can store at least 65 gigs of science data.


00:29:31.280 --> 00:29:34.820
"Downloads occur in two four-hour contacts per day


00:29:34.820 --> 00:29:38.260
where each can transmit 28.6 gigs of data.


00:29:38.260 --> 00:29:40.220
How about that?


00:29:40.220 --> 00:29:42.140
When we reach steady state science operations,


00:29:42.140 --> 00:29:43.180
that's probably correct.


00:29:43.180 --> 00:29:46.300
Yeah, right now we're contacting a little more often,


00:29:46.300 --> 00:29:48.580
because as they're going through commissioning,


00:29:48.580 --> 00:29:51.220
they really need to interact with the observatory much more


00:29:51.220 --> 00:29:51.720
often.


00:29:51.720 --> 00:29:53.260
When we get steady state operations,


00:29:53.260 --> 00:29:55.260
they'll send plans up to the observatory,


00:29:55.260 --> 00:29:57.420
and the observatory will just tick through the plan.


00:29:57.420 --> 00:29:58.740
It'll look at this star.


00:29:58.740 --> 00:29:59.740
It'll throw these filters in it.


00:29:59.740 --> 00:30:02.420
It'll turn to this galaxy, look at these filters.


00:30:02.420 --> 00:30:03.740
It'll go look at this planet.


00:30:03.740 --> 00:30:06.740
And it'll basically do it a program, where right now,


00:30:06.740 --> 00:30:09.060
they're interacting much more often with the observatory.


00:30:09.060 --> 00:30:11.060
So if you tell it to stare at this spot,


00:30:11.060 --> 00:30:13.700
this blank, dark spot in the sky for four hours,


00:30:13.700 --> 00:30:16.020
you don't need to check in with it as frequently,


00:30:16.020 --> 00:30:16.540
as long as it's--


00:30:16.540 --> 00:30:17.040
Exactly.


00:30:17.040 --> 00:30:17.820
--even OK, right?


00:30:17.820 --> 00:30:18.340
Yeah.


00:30:18.340 --> 00:30:21.580
If you told it to stare at that spot and something went wrong,


00:30:21.580 --> 00:30:22.940
the Webb telescope is smart enough


00:30:22.940 --> 00:30:25.500
to skip ahead and go to the next thing in the schedule, where


00:30:25.500 --> 00:30:27.180
Hubble was very ground dependent.


00:30:27.180 --> 00:30:29.780
Everything Hubble did had to be told from the ground.


00:30:29.780 --> 00:30:32.460
And James' T is a little bit more automated,


00:30:32.460 --> 00:30:33.780
where it will, if it's got a problem


00:30:33.780 --> 00:30:34.820
with something it's trying to do,


00:30:34.820 --> 00:30:36.400
it'll just skip ahead to the next thing


00:30:36.400 --> 00:30:38.740
and someone else will reschedule that later on.


00:30:38.740 --> 00:30:44.700
- So I heard that there are some kind of JavaScript stuff


00:30:44.700 --> 00:30:47.460
running actually on the telescope.


00:30:47.460 --> 00:30:48.960
Is there any Python happening there


00:30:48.960 --> 00:30:52.060
or is the Python story really once the data gets back here?


00:30:52.060 --> 00:30:53.960
- There's no Python on the telescope.


00:30:53.960 --> 00:30:56.300
There is JavaScript on the telescope.


00:30:56.300 --> 00:31:01.300
It is a forked private version of JavaScript


00:31:01.380 --> 00:31:03.180
from a while ago, I believe,


00:31:03.180 --> 00:31:07.020
there was a study done to think about


00:31:07.020 --> 00:31:09.220
what's the best way to do instrument commanding,


00:31:09.220 --> 00:31:11.460
and that's what I believe was chosen.


00:31:11.460 --> 00:31:12.540
Yeah. - Yeah.


00:31:12.540 --> 00:31:13.380
Interesting.


00:31:13.380 --> 00:31:14.200
Yeah, it's fine.


00:31:14.200 --> 00:31:15.040
It doesn't really have numbers,


00:31:15.040 --> 00:31:16.540
but I guess you don't need numbers for science.


00:31:16.540 --> 00:31:17.380
- Well, so-- - So it's okay.


00:31:17.380 --> 00:31:18.980
(both laughing)


00:31:18.980 --> 00:31:21.220
- Well, so, I mean, when you think about the volumes of data


00:31:21.220 --> 00:31:22.660
that are coming down from the telescope,


00:31:22.660 --> 00:31:26.700
we're also transmitting the science pixels as integers.


00:31:26.700 --> 00:31:28.060
They're unsigned integer arrays.


00:31:28.060 --> 00:31:30.080
And then when we do the actual processing,


00:31:30.080 --> 00:31:32.100
those are expanded into floating point.


00:31:32.100 --> 00:31:35.080
And so there's expansion that happens on our end


00:31:35.080 --> 00:31:38.080
for processing and storage and analysis.


00:31:38.080 --> 00:31:39.640
- Yeah, cool.


00:31:39.640 --> 00:31:42.680
Mike, you mentioned this HT Condor.


00:31:42.680 --> 00:31:45.560
Maybe tell us a bit more about this.


00:31:45.560 --> 00:31:48.280
Is this something that people would find generally useful


00:31:48.280 --> 00:31:50.760
outside of telescopes?


00:31:50.760 --> 00:31:51.760
- Absolutely.


00:31:51.760 --> 00:31:54.120
It's a very generic product


00:31:54.120 --> 00:31:56.800
developed by the University of Wisconsin.


00:31:56.800 --> 00:31:58.960
Back in the day, they developed it


00:31:58.960 --> 00:32:00.920
because they had all these computers sitting around


00:32:00.920 --> 00:32:03.640
on people's desktops that they wanted to make use of.


00:32:03.640 --> 00:32:06.840
People were using them for three or four hours a day


00:32:06.840 --> 00:32:08.380
and then going off to lunch and going off to meetings


00:32:08.380 --> 00:32:09.680
and the computers were sitting there.


00:32:09.680 --> 00:32:12.620
And they used this system as a way to harness those cycles


00:32:12.620 --> 00:32:14.960
to the point where if no one's sitting at a computer,


00:32:14.960 --> 00:32:17.840
Condor could tell, it could drop a job on that computer,


00:32:17.840 --> 00:32:19.100
run until the person comes back.


00:32:19.100 --> 00:32:20.120
As soon as they hit a keystroke,


00:32:20.120 --> 00:32:22.500
the job would leave that computer.


00:32:22.500 --> 00:32:25.560
And if needed, go off and finish its work somewhere else.


00:32:25.560 --> 00:32:27.160
So it started in that realm


00:32:27.160 --> 00:32:28.000
and they just expanded and expanded.


00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:31.640
- Like SETI@home or one of these sort of grid computing stories.


00:32:31.640 --> 00:32:34.640
- Exactly. It started in that realm.


00:32:34.640 --> 00:32:38.240
Now it can process over full universities


00:32:38.240 --> 00:32:40.440
using all the machines at a university,


00:32:40.440 --> 00:32:41.520
research clusters,


00:32:41.520 --> 00:32:46.680
there are government initiatives that have grid setups.


00:32:46.680 --> 00:32:48.240
Now the commercial clouds are involved.


00:32:48.240 --> 00:32:52.280
They have interfaces to AWS and Microsoft Cloud


00:32:52.280 --> 00:32:53.520
and a whole bunch of others.


00:32:53.520 --> 00:32:57.040
So they really expanded their access.


00:32:57.040 --> 00:32:58.560
It's highly used.


00:32:58.560 --> 00:33:01.560
The realm that pushes it the most


00:33:01.560 --> 00:33:03.760
are the ones that do the--


00:33:03.760 --> 00:33:05.600
oh, Megan, what is the big science that just


00:33:05.600 --> 00:33:07.120
came out last year?


00:33:07.120 --> 00:33:08.720
I'm drawing a blank.


00:33:08.720 --> 00:33:10.440
The big science that just came out?


00:33:10.440 --> 00:33:15.520
Yeah, the detectors, where they found--


00:33:15.520 --> 00:33:16.480
LIGO?


00:33:16.480 --> 00:33:17.280
LIGO, thank you.


00:33:17.280 --> 00:33:18.960
Oh, that's right.


00:33:18.960 --> 00:33:20.880
Something about space and black holes, yeah.


00:33:20.880 --> 00:33:24.440
The computing demands of those detectors are just--


00:33:24.440 --> 00:33:26.840
they make JVC look like a pen,


00:33:26.840 --> 00:33:28.840
you know, computing on your pen.


00:33:28.840 --> 00:33:30.640
So they're really off the charts.


00:33:30.640 --> 00:33:34.040
They need so many cores and clusters to do their computations.


00:33:34.040 --> 00:33:36.040
And this is one of the only system,


00:33:36.040 --> 00:33:38.040
Condor is one of the only systems around


00:33:38.040 --> 00:33:40.840
that can get them the access to the cores they need.


00:33:40.840 --> 00:33:43.240
It's highly used in the LIGO community.


00:33:43.240 --> 00:33:46.840
And I think Python too is a huge part of that LIGO result.


00:33:46.840 --> 00:33:48.840
It is. It is a lot of Python.


00:33:48.840 --> 00:33:52.040
Yep. Condor has a full Python interface.


00:33:52.040 --> 00:33:55.440
So you can talk Python right to Condor,


00:33:55.440 --> 00:33:57.480
import the package and you're off and running.


00:33:57.480 --> 00:33:59.440
>> Yeah. That's really neat.


00:33:59.440 --> 00:34:02.000
Just pip install or conda install,


00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:04.520
hd condor and off it goes, something like that?


00:34:04.520 --> 00:34:05.440
>> Yeah.


00:34:05.440 --> 00:34:07.920
>> pip install power.


00:34:07.920 --> 00:34:13.000
>> Awesome. You mentioned that it


00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:14.880
takes advantage of these computers


00:34:14.880 --> 00:34:16.200
which are sitting idle.


00:34:16.200 --> 00:34:21.420
Of course, we've got folding at home and we've got SETI at home.


00:34:21.420 --> 00:34:23.780
those types of things, which they seem to have gone away,


00:34:23.780 --> 00:34:25.380
which I think it's a little bit sad actually,


00:34:25.380 --> 00:34:28.180
but there's been these things where it's like,


00:34:28.180 --> 00:34:30.780
well, if a personal computer is sitting around idle


00:34:30.780 --> 00:34:33.020
and we've got a bunch of them in an office


00:34:33.020 --> 00:34:35.740
or a university or whatever, then we could use them.


00:34:35.740 --> 00:34:36.740
That's great, right?


00:34:36.740 --> 00:34:38.940
We also mentioned the cloud


00:34:38.940 --> 00:34:40.820
and I guess I had never really thought about it,


00:34:40.820 --> 00:34:44.060
but I know the cloud providers don't want this from you,


00:34:44.060 --> 00:34:47.380
but if you will pay for a virtual machine,


00:34:47.380 --> 00:34:48.780
there's a good chance that it's sitting there


00:34:48.780 --> 00:34:51.780
doing 20% of what it could do.


00:34:51.780 --> 00:34:55.380
So you could actually, if you've got 10 or 100 virtual machines


00:34:55.380 --> 00:34:56.620
running the cloud, you could say, you know what?


00:34:56.620 --> 00:34:58.500
Whatever extra capacity you have,


00:34:58.500 --> 00:35:01.620
I'm going to use that for this other sort of scheduling


00:35:01.620 --> 00:35:02.780
service.


00:35:02.780 --> 00:35:04.360
Yeah, the good thing about astronomy


00:35:04.360 --> 00:35:06.440
is most of it doesn't have to happen in real time.


00:35:06.440 --> 00:35:09.860
So we can buy up the cheap cycles


00:35:09.860 --> 00:35:14.060
where the machines are not being used on a clock


00:35:14.060 --> 00:35:16.860
and get good deals to go off and do our reprocessing


00:35:16.860 --> 00:35:22.940
processing that has to happen. Right, like reserved instances or something like that at AWS.


00:35:22.940 --> 00:35:27.660
Right. HST is already doing some of their process reprocessing in the cloud. That's another point is


00:35:27.660 --> 00:35:33.100
we get the data down from the observatories once and we process it once, put it in our archive,


00:35:33.100 --> 00:35:37.020
and then we reprocess it again and again as the calibration algorithms improve,


00:35:37.020 --> 00:35:41.900
as software bugs are found, and as reference data, particularly calibration reference data,


00:35:41.900 --> 00:35:45.820
special data that's used to remove those instrumental signatures that Megan was talking


00:35:45.820 --> 00:35:51.420
about. As all that supplemental data and algorithms improve, you rerun the data again and again and


00:35:51.420 --> 00:35:55.420
again. And you need the computational capacity to do that while data is still coming down from


00:35:55.420 --> 00:36:00.060
the telescope, because your archive is getting bigger all the time. So you've got a bigger


00:36:00.060 --> 00:36:04.220
crank to turn to get everything up to the best possible product it could be.


00:36:04.220 --> 00:36:08.060
That is pretty fascinating. I hadn't really thought about that you would have to reprocess


00:36:08.060 --> 00:36:09.660
the data. But yeah,


00:36:10.460 --> 00:36:14.660
It drives all our designs because we reprocess the data


00:36:14.660 --> 00:36:17.220
tens of more times than that very first time it


00:36:17.220 --> 00:36:18.860
hits the ground.


00:36:18.860 --> 00:36:19.360
Sure.


00:36:19.360 --> 00:36:22.060
What does the compute stuff look like for you all?


00:36:22.060 --> 00:36:23.860
Are you using GPUs?


00:36:23.860 --> 00:36:29.820
Are you using some of the NumPy, SciPy, AstroPy stack


00:36:29.820 --> 00:36:31.860
to do this?


00:36:31.860 --> 00:36:33.660
Those are definitely involved, yeah.


00:36:33.660 --> 00:36:34.180
Yeah.


00:36:34.180 --> 00:36:38.860
So GPUs, I don't think we have an excessive amount of GPUs.


00:36:38.860 --> 00:36:42.220
probably those are more in the post-processing parts of the software.


00:36:42.220 --> 00:36:46.700
But those other things you mentioned, most definitely,


00:36:46.700 --> 00:36:49.980
and we actually are heavy contributors to those packages as well.


00:36:49.980 --> 00:36:57.500
So we do a lot to provide back to the community the software that we're creating,


00:36:57.500 --> 00:37:03.900
especially our external data analysis, post-processing analysis software,


00:37:03.900 --> 00:37:06.780
so that it can be used by the rest of the community.


00:37:08.540 --> 00:37:14.540
Yeah, the same a Priya asks, what can a user at home do with the data? Or do you need like


00:37:14.540 --> 00:37:22.300
these huge clusters, compute clusters to work on them? There are no books like, so people are


00:37:22.300 --> 00:37:27.180
out there listening, I suspect there are some astronomers who have, you know, an expertise in


00:37:27.180 --> 00:37:31.260
this, but there's probably a lot of people are just fans of space. Yeah, I want to play with


00:37:31.260 --> 00:37:37.420
this? So, you know, any data that's public that you can access in our archive, you can


00:37:37.420 --> 00:37:39.700
download and you can analyze it.


00:37:39.700 --> 00:37:43.220
You can install the science calibration software.


00:37:43.220 --> 00:37:48.420
So the stuff that takes the data that we've already prepared for you and does further


00:37:48.420 --> 00:37:52.100
analysis on it, does we have visualization tools you can install?


00:37:52.100 --> 00:37:57.300
We have many different things that scientists or even non-scientists might want to play


00:37:57.300 --> 00:37:58.500
with to look at the data.


00:37:58.500 --> 00:38:00.540
And that's all possible.


00:38:00.540 --> 00:38:05.100
I do that with Hubble data all the time on my laptop and my laptop just has 16 gigabytes


00:38:05.100 --> 00:38:06.100
of RAM.


00:38:06.100 --> 00:38:12.060
And, you know, now Hubble data is fairly small compared to the machines we were running on.


00:38:12.060 --> 00:38:13.060
Yeah.


00:38:13.060 --> 00:38:14.700
I bet when it first, how old is Hubble?


00:38:14.700 --> 00:38:15.700
20 years?


00:38:15.700 --> 00:38:16.700
30.


00:38:16.700 --> 00:38:17.700
30.


00:38:17.700 --> 00:38:18.700
Yeah.


00:38:18.700 --> 00:38:19.700
30 year old computers probably thought that data wasn't small.


00:38:19.700 --> 00:38:20.700
Yeah.


00:38:20.700 --> 00:38:24.740
So we've gone from terminal services to desktops and laptops and back to terminal services


00:38:24.740 --> 00:38:27.900
eventually in the near future because of the size of the data.


00:38:27.900 --> 00:38:28.900
Yeah.


00:38:28.900 --> 00:38:33.100
Do you have like notebook servers that are running close to the data that then you can


00:38:33.100 --> 00:38:36.380
log into and play with or what's that look like?


00:38:36.380 --> 00:38:39.640
So we do at different levels.


00:38:39.640 --> 00:38:43.740
Like you're talking about Jupyter notebooks, Jupyter lab, that type of thing.


00:38:43.740 --> 00:38:45.700
So that does exist.


00:38:45.700 --> 00:38:51.020
We've been playing around with science platforms in the cloud to give people access to not


00:38:51.020 --> 00:38:54.540
only the software, but the data in a very easy way.


00:38:54.540 --> 00:38:58.620
And I think JupyterLab makes that really, really effective


00:38:58.620 --> 00:39:01.940
for the tools that we can provide to people.


00:39:01.940 --> 00:39:02.780
- Yeah.


00:39:02.780 --> 00:39:03.740
- But you can also run it yourself


00:39:03.740 --> 00:39:05.300
on your own local machines.


00:39:05.300 --> 00:39:06.140
- Sure.


00:39:06.140 --> 00:39:07.740
As the data gets bigger and bigger,


00:39:07.740 --> 00:39:10.900
part of the cost and latency is just transferring, right?


00:39:10.900 --> 00:39:12.980
So if you can run your compute close to it,


00:39:12.980 --> 00:39:14.940
you can save money by not transferring it


00:39:14.940 --> 00:39:16.220
and all sorts of things, right?


00:39:16.220 --> 00:39:17.060
- Exactly.


00:39:17.060 --> 00:39:20.220
Or reading it into memory for very, very large files.


00:39:20.220 --> 00:39:22.660
And so as a system,


00:39:22.660 --> 00:39:24.620
the system itself needs to be very large


00:39:24.620 --> 00:39:26.900
to process the sheer volume of data that we get


00:39:26.900 --> 00:39:28.860
and are constantly getting and reprocessing


00:39:28.860 --> 00:39:30.580
and storing and serving.


00:39:30.580 --> 00:39:32.260
But for individual data pieces,


00:39:32.260 --> 00:39:34.540
it's still very possible for people


00:39:34.540 --> 00:39:36.220
to process it on their own.


00:39:36.220 --> 00:39:37.040
- Sure.


00:39:37.040 --> 00:39:37.880
Do you use things like Dask


00:39:37.880 --> 00:39:42.060
or any of these sort of panda NumPy like things


00:39:42.060 --> 00:39:45.300
that scale out to larger data?


00:39:45.300 --> 00:39:46.140
- Yeah.


00:39:46.140 --> 00:39:49.060
It depends on the tool and what the purpose is


00:39:49.060 --> 00:39:50.340
that you're using.


00:39:50.340 --> 00:39:51.740
- Sure. - Yeah, for sure.


00:39:51.740 --> 00:39:56.460
Mike, got some thoughts on this before I move us along?


00:39:56.460 --> 00:40:00.580
>> No, that's a really good summary of the picture.


00:40:00.580 --> 00:40:02.740
I think I'm pretty sure at this point,


00:40:02.740 --> 00:40:04.980
all the public HST data is in the Cloud.


00:40:04.980 --> 00:40:07.020
I think it's all on AWS.


00:40:07.020 --> 00:40:11.260
I believe you can work with it there,


00:40:11.260 --> 00:40:14.380
especially if you've got research to do.


00:40:14.380 --> 00:40:18.260
>> Yeah. One of the things that got my attention,


00:40:18.260 --> 00:40:20.540
besides someone I think sending me a message,


00:40:20.540 --> 00:40:23.340
"Hey, you should talk to the JWST folks."


00:40:23.340 --> 00:40:26.700
Is you have over at GitHub,


00:40:26.700 --> 00:40:29.500
you have the Space Telescope Science Institute


00:40:29.500 --> 00:40:33.580
where you've got all kinds of various things


00:40:33.580 --> 00:40:35.100
that people can go play with, right?


00:40:35.100 --> 00:40:39.460
Maybe tell us a bit about some of the highlights over there.


00:40:39.460 --> 00:40:42.500
The one that I ran across is just JWST.


00:40:42.500 --> 00:40:43.340
- Yeah.


00:40:43.340 --> 00:40:46.500
- Which is, it describes itself as the Python Library


00:40:46.500 --> 00:40:50.220
for Science Observations from the JWST.


00:40:50.220 --> 00:40:52.860
- Yeah, so this is what we call


00:40:52.860 --> 00:40:56.520
the science calibration package for JWST.


00:40:56.520 --> 00:41:00.100
The software that lives here is able to


00:41:00.100 --> 00:41:02.700
do the detector calibration that we talked about


00:41:02.700 --> 00:41:05.620
and image combination and everything else


00:41:05.620 --> 00:41:07.940
that we need to do to create the standard products


00:41:07.940 --> 00:41:10.980
we've agreed to create for the mission.


00:41:10.980 --> 00:41:12.780
That's all contained in this package


00:41:12.780 --> 00:41:16.100
and this package gets installed in our backend systems


00:41:16.100 --> 00:41:18.240
to be run as we're processing the data


00:41:18.240 --> 00:41:20.840
and it's ready to be processed at this level.


00:41:20.840 --> 00:41:23.440
So this is what users would install


00:41:23.440 --> 00:41:28.400
if you wanted to reprocess or do higher level analysis


00:41:28.400 --> 00:41:31.760
of the JWST data for different instruments.


00:41:31.760 --> 00:41:35.800
- You spoke about the reprocessing and the reanalyzing.


00:41:35.800 --> 00:41:38.200
So you would install this and if you had an idea


00:41:38.200 --> 00:41:41.360
on how to maybe do different noise reduction


00:41:41.360 --> 00:41:43.320
or other processing.


00:41:43.320 --> 00:41:44.160
- Exactly.


00:41:44.160 --> 00:41:45.000
- This is what you'd do.


00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:45.820
- Exactly.


00:41:45.820 --> 00:41:46.660
- Got it.


00:41:46.660 --> 00:41:49.820
perform some base calibration to put the data in the archive


00:41:49.820 --> 00:41:51.820
and to make it somewhat usable.


00:41:51.820 --> 00:41:55.160
But most high-level scientists are doing their own recalibration


00:41:55.160 --> 00:41:57.180
and they're tuning the data for what they're


00:41:57.180 --> 00:41:58.720
trying to get out of it, especially


00:41:58.720 --> 00:42:00.520
if they're working at the margins of noise


00:42:00.520 --> 00:42:02.080
and other things where they really


00:42:02.080 --> 00:42:05.600
have to work with the data to get out of it


00:42:05.600 --> 00:42:07.020
to fit their science needs.


00:42:07.020 --> 00:42:08.680
So a lot of this is the byproduct


00:42:08.680 --> 00:42:10.180
of this proposal process.


00:42:10.180 --> 00:42:11.840
Because we don't know what the science is


00:42:11.840 --> 00:42:13.720
that's going to come through, we try


00:42:13.720 --> 00:42:16.440
provide the best generic processing for all the data.


00:42:16.440 --> 00:42:20.600
Right. It's pretty neat that this is just here on GitHub.


00:42:20.600 --> 00:42:39.280
Right. You know, that's cool. Yeah, I suspect when Hubble came out, it was not like, well, here's the open source thing. And here's how you contribute back in the same way. Right. I'm sure it's aired to some degree, but the openness of science and the really the computational bits of science over on GitHub is pretty amazing.


00:42:39.800 --> 00:42:44.200
It's a lot of fun. I think we started using GitHub when it first came out.


00:42:44.200 --> 00:42:50.440
We were, especially during Hubble, using Subversion and even older version control systems.


00:42:50.440 --> 00:42:51.720
CVS or something dreadful.


00:42:51.720 --> 00:42:56.200
CVS, RCS even. Whatever we could use.


00:42:56.200 --> 00:42:57.320
Yeah.


00:42:57.320 --> 00:43:03.720
They were run on internal systems and managed on internal web pages.


00:43:03.720 --> 00:43:09.560
So when GitHub came out, it was really nice to be able to share our software,


00:43:09.560 --> 00:43:13.440
not only with astronomers in the larger community,


00:43:13.440 --> 00:43:16.520
but with other missions that we interact with.


00:43:16.520 --> 00:43:19.400
And to be able to talk to them about how we develop


00:43:19.400 --> 00:43:22.800
and accept changes and improvements into the software.


00:43:22.800 --> 00:43:26.120
- Yeah, you see right here, there's 541 issues


00:43:26.120 --> 00:43:31.120
and 20 PRs that are open, but 3,462 that are closed.


00:43:31.120 --> 00:43:33.920
- Yeah. - And that's pretty amazing.


00:43:33.920 --> 00:43:38.360
- Yeah, that's, we do a lot of work.


00:43:38.360 --> 00:43:40.600
- And JWST is a new mission now.


00:43:40.600 --> 00:43:42.000
- Yeah, awesome.


00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:45.400
So another thing that I ran across that looks interesting


00:43:45.400 --> 00:43:50.400
is the WebPSF, which is a simulation tool, right?


00:43:50.400 --> 00:43:54.280
Maybe tell people about this.


00:43:54.280 --> 00:43:56.800
- So Web is obviously the telescope,


00:43:56.800 --> 00:43:59.800
PSF are point spread functions.


00:43:59.800 --> 00:44:03.280
This is the statistical pattern that light falling


00:44:03.280 --> 00:44:05.600
on the detector from a star would make.


00:44:05.600 --> 00:44:09.040
And you can predict what that pattern is gonna be


00:44:09.040 --> 00:44:11.980
based on the optics that are in your telescope.


00:44:11.980 --> 00:44:15.880
And so this piece of software takes that understanding


00:44:15.880 --> 00:44:17.480
of the optics in the telescope


00:44:17.480 --> 00:44:21.040
and how light gets transmitted through those optics,


00:44:21.040 --> 00:44:23.760
including through different wavelengths


00:44:23.760 --> 00:44:26.080
and create simulated images


00:44:26.080 --> 00:44:28.560
of what we might be able to see.


00:44:28.560 --> 00:44:32.040
This allows us to not only predict


00:44:32.040 --> 00:44:35.600
how the telescope is gonna perform in different ways,


00:44:35.600 --> 00:44:39.280
but develop our software, develop the algorithms


00:44:39.280 --> 00:44:43.320
that we use to do pull out stars and stuff from images.


00:44:43.320 --> 00:44:44.520
- Yeah, very neat.


00:44:44.520 --> 00:44:46.960
I suspect that people didn't have access to the telescope


00:44:46.960 --> 00:44:49.880
and they wanted to play around with some stuff.


00:44:49.880 --> 00:44:51.400
Maybe they could use this.


00:44:51.400 --> 00:44:52.440
- Yeah, they could.


00:44:52.440 --> 00:44:55.320
There's other simulation tools that are out there


00:44:55.320 --> 00:44:58.440
that will simulate full astronomical scenes as well.


00:44:58.440 --> 00:45:00.880
So not just individual stars,


00:45:00.880 --> 00:45:03.680
but galaxies and the combination of the two.


00:45:03.680 --> 00:45:05.640
- Do you have some you can point people at?


00:45:05.640 --> 00:45:08.880
- I think I'd have to send you a link.


00:45:08.880 --> 00:45:10.360
- Yeah, we'll put it in the show notes.


00:45:10.360 --> 00:45:11.200
Yeah, we'll put it in the show notes


00:45:11.200 --> 00:45:12.020
so people can get to it.


00:45:12.020 --> 00:45:13.280
That's great. - Let's do that.


00:45:13.280 --> 00:45:14.200
- Yeah, awesome.


00:45:14.200 --> 00:45:16.560
Another thing I ran across looking at all this stuff


00:45:16.560 --> 00:45:19.360
is this place called AstroConda.


00:45:19.360 --> 00:45:21.280
And there's a whole bunch of stuff,


00:45:21.280 --> 00:45:24.240
just tons of libraries in here.


00:45:24.240 --> 00:45:25.920
It looks like there's a lot of neat things,


00:45:25.920 --> 00:45:29.000
like for example, working with the ASDF file format,


00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:32.880
which I suspect is something that you all provide a lot of.


00:45:32.880 --> 00:45:33.720
- Yeah.


00:45:33.720 --> 00:45:34.540
- And so on.


00:45:34.540 --> 00:45:36.200
- So we developed that format.


00:45:36.200 --> 00:45:37.280
We wrote that format.


00:45:37.280 --> 00:45:39.620
The primary interpreter is in Python.


00:45:39.620 --> 00:45:42.740
So a little bit of astronomy history.


00:45:42.740 --> 00:45:46.220
Astronomy for a very long time has used a file format


00:45:46.220 --> 00:45:50.300
called FITS, Flexible Image Transport System.


00:45:50.300 --> 00:45:53.380
It started around the time data was being saved on tapes,


00:45:53.380 --> 00:45:54.220
on tape store.


00:45:54.220 --> 00:45:55.300
(laughing)


00:45:55.300 --> 00:45:56.900
- You might want to optimize two different things


00:45:56.900 --> 00:45:59.060
It's going on tape in the SSD.


00:45:59.060 --> 00:46:05.500
Right. And so it's been in the community a long time and a lot of community tools are based on it, accessing it.


00:46:05.500 --> 00:46:16.820
And it was part of it was a big part of this other thing in the astronomy community called IRAF, which was a common software package.


00:46:16.820 --> 00:46:22.580
It actually had its own virtual operating system and command line languages that did the reduction for us.


00:46:24.060 --> 00:46:31.500
One of the things that JWST brought about is we needed to be able to handle those complex optical


00:46:31.500 --> 00:46:37.580
path descriptions for how the light from a star you're observing gets onto the detector


00:46:37.580 --> 00:46:42.460
and how you translate those positions back and forth. So where's the telescope pointed?


00:46:42.460 --> 00:46:48.060
Where is this light as it's moving around? And how can I tell at this pixel what star that relates


00:46:48.060 --> 00:46:53.660
to in the sky? And it seems very non-trivial because you've got all these different hexagonal


00:46:53.660 --> 00:46:58.020
pieces that are independently adjustable and you've got to sort of reassemble that into


00:46:58.020 --> 00:46:59.420
a continuous thing, right?


00:46:59.420 --> 00:47:01.260
Well, so that's part of it.


00:47:01.260 --> 00:47:04.740
And even larger part is the number of optics that are in that chain.


00:47:04.740 --> 00:47:09.860
And then the optics inside each of the instruments and some of them are spectroscopic instruments


00:47:09.860 --> 00:47:12.420
that divide light into its constituent wavelengths.


00:47:12.420 --> 00:47:17.420
And those wavelengths have different travel paths and will fall on the detector in different


00:47:17.420 --> 00:47:23.340
places in mathematically predictable ways, but not always simple mathematically predictable


00:47:23.340 --> 00:47:30.380
ways. And so saving that information was really difficult in fits. And we developed this new


00:47:30.380 --> 00:47:36.380
format that will allow us to save analytical models into the data itself, that can then be


00:47:36.380 --> 00:47:42.540
opened up by the users and very easily used to understand the relationship between the stars and


00:47:42.540 --> 00:47:49.260
the pixels that they are looking at and the stars in the sky. And so we started JWST with that. And


00:47:49.260 --> 00:47:52.460
And it actually gets packaged into a FITS file.


00:47:52.460 --> 00:47:57.340
But in later missions, we'll be using just as diff.


00:47:57.340 --> 00:48:00.500
- Yeah, that's really neat.


00:48:00.500 --> 00:48:05.100
So it lets you save more of just the raw data.


00:48:05.100 --> 00:48:09.140
- It gives us a really nice way of saving information


00:48:09.140 --> 00:48:11.060
we need to understand about the data


00:48:11.060 --> 00:48:12.500
along with the data itself.


00:48:12.500 --> 00:48:14.480
It also saves the binary rays.


00:48:14.480 --> 00:48:17.600
It's actually, if you were to look at it,


00:48:17.600 --> 00:48:20.320
the text part of the format is YAML


00:48:20.320 --> 00:48:22.080
based on JSON schema standard.


00:48:22.080 --> 00:48:24.040
- Yeah, fantastic.


00:48:24.040 --> 00:48:28.800
So looking through this AstroConda thing here,


00:48:28.800 --> 00:48:30.840
obviously there's stuff that's very focused


00:48:30.840 --> 00:48:34.440
on astronomy like ASDF,


00:48:34.440 --> 00:48:37.000
but there's also other cool libraries like Apters.


00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:41.480
Right, Apters is, there's all these like little things.


00:48:41.480 --> 00:48:46.480
So if I wanna write something to a temp file


00:48:46.760 --> 00:48:50.280
where's my user home or stuff like that, right? You can ask questions like that.


00:48:50.280 --> 00:48:56.520
Of this. I actually, I haven't looked at abjures, but it must be being used by one of our other


00:48:56.520 --> 00:49:01.480
sub packages and somebody wrote it, wrote it for a good purpose. So this, this AstroCon


00:49:01.480 --> 00:49:07.000
to site that you're looking at was, you know, this repackaging of tools that are written in Python,


00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:13.480
often with C extensions that can be used by astronomers in the community to do what they


00:49:13.480 --> 00:49:16.200
they need to do to look at the data, calibrate the data.


00:49:16.200 --> 00:49:18.940
And so this AstroConda channel is a Conda channel


00:49:18.940 --> 00:49:21.680
that allows us to organize that information


00:49:21.680 --> 00:49:24.640
and deliver it to users who are using Conda environments.


00:49:24.640 --> 00:49:25.480
- Nice.


00:49:25.480 --> 00:49:26.300
- Or virtual environments.


00:49:26.300 --> 00:49:28.200
- Yeah, you can say something like,


00:49:28.200 --> 00:49:30.320
install this channel, everything in this channel,


00:49:30.320 --> 00:49:34.080
and then you'll basically be able to do most of the work


00:49:34.080 --> 00:49:36.320
that we're talking about or something like that.


00:49:36.320 --> 00:49:37.160
- Right.


00:49:37.160 --> 00:49:38.560
And so most of these are now available


00:49:38.560 --> 00:49:42.680
also separately on Conda Forge and PyPy.


00:49:42.680 --> 00:49:45.160
So often people will install from there too.


00:49:45.160 --> 00:49:46.400
- Sure.


00:49:46.400 --> 00:49:48.600
Yeah, so we've got, let's see,


00:49:48.600 --> 00:49:52.480
AST eval, a safe minimalistic evaluator for Python.


00:49:52.480 --> 00:49:53.560
That's pretty cool.


00:49:53.560 --> 00:49:56.200
You've got mysterious ones like cube tools,


00:49:56.200 --> 00:49:58.360
which just refuse to identify themselves.


00:49:58.360 --> 00:50:00.360
(laughing)


00:50:00.360 --> 00:50:02.580
- That's actually for 3D images.


00:50:02.580 --> 00:50:05.480
So we stack things up.


00:50:05.480 --> 00:50:07.400
- Yeah, cool.


00:50:07.400 --> 00:50:08.960
Anyway, I'll put the link to this in the show notes


00:50:08.960 --> 00:50:10.040
so people can look around.


00:50:10.040 --> 00:50:11.640
It's just interesting to see all the stuff


00:50:11.640 --> 00:50:14.240
that you were bringing together here.


00:50:14.240 --> 00:50:17.000
You've got the STSI.


00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:20.400
- So that's a meta package for Conda


00:50:20.400 --> 00:50:23.600
that will install the individual things that go together.


00:50:23.600 --> 00:50:25.160
- Yeah, of course, of course.


00:50:25.160 --> 00:50:29.880
All right, let's see, what else did I wanna make sure


00:50:29.880 --> 00:50:31.520
we get a chance to touch on?


00:50:31.520 --> 00:50:40.000
So this one, this JWCS1.


00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:43.180
- Yes, one sounds pretty interesting.


00:50:43.180 --> 00:50:48.180
One of the challenges with the telescopes, I'm sure,


00:50:48.180 --> 00:50:50.940
is things orbit around other things


00:50:50.940 --> 00:50:53.260
which are orbiting around other things,


00:50:53.260 --> 00:50:55.540
around the sun, which is around through the galaxy


00:50:55.540 --> 00:50:56.500
and whatnot, right?


00:50:56.500 --> 00:50:58.460
So figuring out where you're pointing


00:50:58.460 --> 00:50:59.940
is probably pretty tricky.


00:50:59.940 --> 00:51:01.740
Is that what this library does?


00:51:01.740 --> 00:51:04.420
- So when I was talking about being able to understand


00:51:04.420 --> 00:51:07.960
the light and where it is in the sky and on the detector,


00:51:07.960 --> 00:51:10.100
This is what we're saving in the as diff file,


00:51:10.100 --> 00:51:12.280
these GWCS representations,


00:51:12.280 --> 00:51:14.860
generalized world coordinate system.


00:51:14.860 --> 00:51:16.260
And that's a mouthful.


00:51:16.260 --> 00:51:19.140
World coordinate systems are what astronomers use


00:51:19.140 --> 00:51:22.540
to relate an undistorted scene on the sky


00:51:22.540 --> 00:51:24.580
to what you have on the detector.


00:51:24.580 --> 00:51:28.420
And it changes depending on what the telescope optics are.


00:51:28.420 --> 00:51:32.820
But what GWCS provides is layered on top


00:51:32.820 --> 00:51:34.380
of astropy modeling,


00:51:34.380 --> 00:51:38.100
which allows you to string together mathematical models


00:51:38.100 --> 00:51:41.860
to translate coordinates between two different systems.


00:51:41.860 --> 00:51:44.660
And so we use this for translating perfect sky


00:51:44.660 --> 00:51:46.420
coordinates to detector coordinates


00:51:46.420 --> 00:51:48.900
and intermediate systems as well.


00:51:48.900 --> 00:51:51.340
And one of the benefits to that is sometimes


00:51:51.340 --> 00:51:55.080
there are effects that happen in the detector that


00:51:55.080 --> 00:51:57.540
should be corrected at different stages along the way,


00:51:57.540 --> 00:51:59.380
and you can insert those corrections


00:51:59.380 --> 00:52:02.220
in this pipeline of models.


00:52:02.220 --> 00:52:07.180
It makes sense to correct in this coordinate system,


00:52:07.180 --> 00:52:09.560
potentially rather than at different levels,


00:52:09.560 --> 00:52:10.400
something like that.


00:52:10.400 --> 00:52:11.240
I see.


00:52:11.240 --> 00:52:14.400
Yeah, pretty fascinating.


00:52:14.400 --> 00:52:15.660
It sounds complicated.


00:52:15.660 --> 00:52:16.620
- It's cool.


00:52:16.620 --> 00:52:18.340
- Yeah, it is definitely cool.


00:52:18.340 --> 00:52:21.740
- It's built on a lot of other open source code


00:52:21.740 --> 00:52:25.380
that is useful for more things than just astronomy, right?


00:52:25.380 --> 00:52:28.500
Modeling is useful for everything in science.


00:52:28.500 --> 00:52:30.860
Fitting is useful for everything.


00:52:30.860 --> 00:52:33.380
So it's cool that we can help provide tools like that


00:52:33.380 --> 00:52:34.220
to the community.


00:52:34.220 --> 00:52:35.180
- Yeah, for sure.


00:52:35.180 --> 00:52:37.980
What's the machine learning story


00:52:37.980 --> 00:52:41.860
around the telescopes and the data?


00:52:41.860 --> 00:52:43.420
Are you all doing anything with that?


00:52:43.420 --> 00:52:44.500
Any AI stuff?


00:52:44.500 --> 00:52:46.740
If you want to take it.


00:52:46.740 --> 00:52:48.700
- So I'll talk about,


00:52:48.700 --> 00:52:51.780
you can pipe up Mike for the HST stuff if you want.


00:52:51.780 --> 00:52:53.860
- Hi, I'm not familiar with that aspect.


00:52:53.860 --> 00:52:55.260
- Oh, no?


00:52:55.260 --> 00:52:58.140
So yeah, obviously we have data science groups


00:52:58.140 --> 00:53:00.840
at the Institute that are doing a lot of machine learning


00:53:00.840 --> 00:53:06.360
Machine learning can be applied to things like the catalogs of objects that have, you know,


00:53:06.360 --> 00:53:16.000
astronomers scrutinize details about what these things are that are confirmed that can be used to build up information about unknown images, right?


00:53:16.000 --> 00:53:26.640
Machine learning for processing, we've started doing some of that related to the HST processing in order to optimize scheduling, time,


00:53:27.720 --> 00:53:33.480
spreading the data out, understanding, you know, if there are certain metadata keywords,


00:53:33.480 --> 00:53:38.840
like what Mike was talking about before, that we know will affect the processing in certain ways,


00:53:38.840 --> 00:53:44.920
we can detect that early and make up for it. Interesting. How much of a challenge


00:53:44.920 --> 00:53:51.240
is an optimization problem of who gets time when? So this person wants to look here and do this,


00:53:51.240 --> 00:53:54.520
then that person is going to look over there. But if there's somebody that wants to look in the


00:53:54.520 --> 00:54:00.280
middle, maybe you could save some fuel by turning a partway, letting them do their job, like skip


00:54:00.280 --> 00:54:04.360
ahead in line and then keep moving. Yeah, it's a great point. It's not only fuel, it's you don't


00:54:04.360 --> 00:54:08.280
want to move your mechanisms more often than you have to. So you don't want to flip the filter


00:54:08.280 --> 00:54:12.600
wheel three positions left, 10 positions right, when you could have done that in a more economic


00:54:12.600 --> 00:54:17.240
way and save the wear and tear on your system. So there's a lot of optimization that goes into the


00:54:17.240 --> 00:54:22.120
planning and scheduling system. And of course, with astronomy, there's visibility. You've got


00:54:22.760 --> 00:54:27.800
certain targets are not visible at all times of the year, just depending on where they are relative


00:54:27.800 --> 00:54:31.880
to the sun. Right, you can't turn around and look right past the sun because it'll...


00:54:31.880 --> 00:54:42.680
JVC especially cannot look back. So even in the software there are defined regions of avoidance


00:54:42.680 --> 00:54:49.080
that we are not allowed to move the telescope. And so we have planning and scheduling systems


00:54:49.080 --> 00:54:56.360
that know what these things are, that know the range of places that this telescope proposal


00:54:56.360 --> 00:55:02.120
approval community has decided to point the telescope. And it figures out what is the most


00:55:02.120 --> 00:55:08.600
optimal way to organize those observations to get them to the astronomers as fast as possible.


00:55:08.600 --> 00:55:16.680
>> Interesting. All right. Well, towards the end of our time together, what


00:55:16.680 --> 00:55:21.320
Other things are you doing with Python you think people find interesting that maybe I haven't asked you about yet?


00:55:21.320 --> 00:55:25.160
Or did I cover everything


00:55:25.160 --> 00:55:28.680
We covered a lot of ground


00:55:28.680 --> 00:55:33.820
There's a lot of nuts and bolts that the data processing side has to do, you know, we interface with a lot of databases


00:55:33.820 --> 00:55:39.640
So we need database interface packages that talk to microsoft sql server and sqlite database files


00:55:39.640 --> 00:55:42.280
And things like that as megan said we do a lot of


00:55:43.960 --> 00:55:48.680
parsing, so we're JSON parsing and XML parsing. And so we're all those packages come into play.


00:55:48.680 --> 00:55:53.480
And then there's good old fashioned bit busting, where we've got to get into the telemetry binary


00:55:53.480 --> 00:55:59.480
files and bust out the sections of bits that are the data from the wrappers that come down.


00:55:59.480 --> 00:56:06.200
Figure it out. Yeah, exactly. So yeah, various packages across the Python scheme help us. And


00:56:06.200 --> 00:56:10.440
there are a lot of external community packages that help us as well. And then there's also all


00:56:10.440 --> 00:56:13.260
all the documentation that has to be done.


00:56:13.260 --> 00:56:15.780
We're heavy users, especially for our externally


00:56:15.780 --> 00:56:20.220
delivered packages of Sphinx and code documentation.


00:56:20.220 --> 00:56:23.220
We have a lot of our stuff on read the docs,


00:56:23.220 --> 00:56:25.220
a lot of our infrastructure for testing.


00:56:25.220 --> 00:56:29.660
- I just had the folks on from Myst and


00:56:29.660 --> 00:56:34.060
have to do a better search to get something


00:56:34.060 --> 00:56:36.980
other than a video game, but the Myst project,


00:56:36.980 --> 00:56:38.860
do you still do all your stuff in restructured text


00:56:38.860 --> 00:56:41.420
Are you doing any of the markdown things with mist?


00:56:41.420 --> 00:56:47.020
I'm not doing anything with mist. I have done a lot of restructured tests and pure


00:56:47.020 --> 00:56:53.260
latex. And Sphinx helps with those two things, too. A lot of the scientists themselves just


00:56:53.260 --> 00:56:56.620
write pure latex. They just write on their papers in pure latex.


00:56:56.620 --> 00:57:03.420
The symbols for it are so crazy. It's so many like, but what comes out of it is really remarkable.


00:57:03.420 --> 00:57:08.460
So, I mean, it's really pretty. I remember being introduced to it even as an undergrad.


00:57:08.460 --> 00:57:12.780
in the 90s and was like, this is, this actually looks much cooler than word.


00:57:12.780 --> 00:57:19.020
But when I was in grad school, I did some of my homework in LaTeX, but I haven't touched it for


00:57:19.020 --> 00:57:25.740
many, many years. It's practical. Yeah. They still, a lot of the journals and a lot of the


00:57:25.740 --> 00:57:31.420
astronomy conferences expect you to turn in posters and papers written in LaTeX that conform


00:57:31.420 --> 00:57:36.460
to their standards. Yeah, absolutely. All right. One final question I want to ask you about,


00:57:37.180 --> 00:57:42.620
And Megan, you said you were working on this is the Nancy Grace Roman space telescope.


00:57:42.620 --> 00:57:47.900
So we just like we haven't even really got the web telescope fully online and,


00:57:47.900 --> 00:57:52.220
and you're working on this in this next one. Give us the elevator pitch for this so people can be


00:57:52.220 --> 00:57:57.740
excited. And what's the timeframe? So Nancy Grace Roman is really cool.


00:57:57.740 --> 00:58:04.780
It is also going to go out to L2 where JWST is sitting in part because it's an infrared


00:58:04.780 --> 00:58:08.140
telescope as well. It's focused in near infrared. So more similar.


00:58:08.140 --> 00:58:09.980
And the web one might get lonely, so it needs a friend.


00:58:09.980 --> 00:58:15.260
Yeah. I mean, there are some other telescopes out there too, but yes, we need more friends.


00:58:15.260 --> 00:58:22.300
And so it is about, the mirror is about the same size as Hubble, but its optical prescription


00:58:22.300 --> 00:58:26.140
gives it a much wider field of view. So a hundred times the field of view of Hubble.


00:58:26.140 --> 00:58:34.700
And it has way more detectors and pixels, about 300 megapixels. So there's 18 detectors,


00:58:34.700 --> 00:58:38.700
and every time we take a picture, all those detectors are going off.


00:58:38.700 --> 00:58:43.600
So there's also a lot more data volume coming down that we get to process.


00:58:43.600 --> 00:58:45.900
But a lot of cool things we can do.


00:58:45.900 --> 00:58:49.740
We can, you know, reach the level of the Hubble Deep Field very fast.


00:58:49.740 --> 00:58:52.580
We're going to cover about 50 times more space


00:58:52.580 --> 00:58:56.680
in the first five years of this mission than Hubble has in 30 years.


00:58:56.680 --> 00:59:01.240
So it's going to provide a lot of cool things for the community.


00:59:01.240 --> 00:59:03.400
It's also a survey telescope.


00:59:03.400 --> 00:59:09.480
So a lot of its time is dedicated to some surveys that want to be done to support the community


00:59:09.480 --> 00:59:15.320
looking for exoplanets and they expect to find several thousand exoplanets during the first


00:59:15.320 --> 00:59:21.000
five years of the mission, investigating dark energy and the expansion of the universe and


00:59:21.000 --> 00:59:27.480
the physics behind that. And so and other things that I'm sure astronomers will come up with.


00:59:28.280 --> 00:59:34.360
One of the cool things is that it'll be launched to be compatible and collaborative with JWST


00:59:34.360 --> 00:59:40.840
and LSST, one of the large ground-based missions, and Euclid, one of the European-based missions.


00:59:40.840 --> 00:59:45.640
So it's really cool to be in this era of astronomy where the missions can really be, you know,


00:59:45.640 --> 00:59:50.440
working together to make cool new discoveries and take data. That's fantastic. I haven't even


00:59:50.440 --> 00:59:55.240
thought of them working together. All right, quick question from Julian audience. We'll wrap it up.


00:59:55.240 --> 00:59:57.800
How many of the experiments are providing data


00:59:57.800 --> 00:59:59.480
through the pipelines immediately


00:59:59.480 --> 01:00:05.160
versus that priority, like private period


01:00:05.160 --> 01:00:06.400
that we talked about?


01:00:06.400 --> 01:00:08.280
So some of that is up to the scientists.


01:00:08.280 --> 01:00:11.280
The scientists can choose when they submit their proposal


01:00:11.280 --> 01:00:13.920
to make the data public immediately.


01:00:13.920 --> 01:00:16.720
As soon as we get it, we process it, it's in the archive,


01:00:16.720 --> 01:00:17.480
and it's there.


01:00:17.480 --> 01:00:20.280
That's very, very fast.


01:00:20.280 --> 01:00:23.200
One of the standards for Hubble is there's typically a year


01:00:23.200 --> 01:00:27.000
that the scientists have to look at the data exclusively


01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:29.480
with their group and do the science they want to do


01:00:29.480 --> 01:00:30.540
and then it'll be released.


01:00:30.540 --> 01:00:33.640
But I think that there are also cases of longer than a year.


01:00:33.640 --> 01:00:34.640
- Yeah.


01:00:34.640 --> 01:00:36.200
- And was it Roman going to...


01:00:36.200 --> 01:00:40.440
- Roman has no proprietary period.


01:00:40.440 --> 01:00:42.720
The data will all be public immediately


01:00:42.720 --> 01:00:45.560
and we'll be serving data in the cloud and on-prem.


01:00:45.560 --> 01:00:47.800
- Wow.


01:00:47.800 --> 01:00:49.400
So no dragging your feet if you're trying


01:00:49.400 --> 01:00:51.640
to make a discovery and want to get credit for it.


01:00:51.640 --> 01:00:53.100
- No, no.


01:00:53.100 --> 01:00:55.100
- Yeah, no scooping other people either.


01:00:55.100 --> 01:00:56.380
You gotta be on the ball.


01:00:56.380 --> 01:00:57.220
- That's right.


01:00:57.220 --> 01:01:01.140
Okay, so I think we gotta leave it there,


01:01:01.140 --> 01:01:03.340
but it's really fascinating to see the ways


01:01:03.340 --> 01:01:05.660
that Python and the data science tools


01:01:05.660 --> 01:01:08.740
are connecting us with space and these discoveries.


01:01:08.740 --> 01:01:10.900
So thanks for sharing those.


01:01:10.900 --> 01:01:12.140
- Yeah, thanks for having us.


01:01:12.140 --> 01:01:12.960
- You're quite welcome.


01:01:12.960 --> 01:01:14.260
- Yeah, now before you get out of here,


01:01:14.260 --> 01:01:15.740
you gotta answer the final two questions,


01:01:15.740 --> 01:01:16.740
but there's a couple of you,


01:01:16.740 --> 01:01:20.380
so just maybe lightning round.


01:01:20.380 --> 01:01:23.020
So if you're gonna write some Python code,


01:01:23.020 --> 01:01:25.020
And what editor would you use these days?


01:01:25.020 --> 01:01:27.860
I'm old school. I'm a VI editor.


01:01:27.860 --> 01:01:29.860
[LAUGHTER]


01:01:29.860 --> 01:01:33.160
Yeah, I use VI, especially if I'm logging into servers and stuff,


01:01:33.160 --> 01:01:34.780
or I'm doing something quick.


01:01:34.780 --> 01:01:39.540
If I'm doing a more complicated development, I usually use Sublime.


01:01:39.540 --> 01:01:42.700
- Okay, fantastic. - But in the past, I've used PyCharm and other ones.


01:01:42.700 --> 01:01:43.840
Sure.


01:01:43.840 --> 01:01:46.340
And how about a notable PyPI package?


01:01:46.340 --> 01:01:48.220
Some library you came across recently and you're like,


01:01:48.220 --> 01:01:51.220
"Oh, this is so cool. People should know about this."


01:01:52.340 --> 01:01:54.540
I highly recommend the Condor package.


01:01:54.540 --> 01:01:58.820
If you've got to do any kind of distributed data processing,


01:01:58.820 --> 01:02:01.540
you should really know what Condor is providing.


01:02:01.540 --> 01:02:03.420
So I highly recommend exploring that.


01:02:03.420 --> 01:02:04.540
Fantastic.


01:02:04.540 --> 01:02:05.340
Megan?


01:02:05.340 --> 01:02:07.020
So I'll go a little bit to--


01:02:07.020 --> 01:02:08.340
I know we've talked about this.


01:02:08.340 --> 01:02:10.380
I was so excited to see PyLab come out,


01:02:10.380 --> 01:02:12.420
because it provides us--


01:02:12.420 --> 01:02:14.780
not PyLab, I'm sorry, JupyterLab.


01:02:14.780 --> 01:02:16.980
It provides us with so many opportunities


01:02:16.980 --> 01:02:20.820
to get the data and the analysis to our scientists


01:02:20.820 --> 01:02:22.300
in the easiest way possible.


01:02:22.300 --> 01:02:28.140
allows them flexibility to work on it with their colleagues and produce really good science.


01:02:28.140 --> 01:02:32.060
But from the other side, I actually saw recently this package called Silly,


01:02:32.060 --> 01:02:39.500
which just produces random bits of data you can use for tests with all sorts of


01:02:39.500 --> 01:02:47.500
entertaining things. Yeah, Silly. I think you can even have it emit Chuck Norris quotes and stuff


01:02:47.500 --> 01:02:51.660
like that, which can make it, you know, "Oh no, that's pie jokes." That was the other one I found


01:02:51.660 --> 01:02:52.940
- Oh, I love pie jokes.


01:02:52.940 --> 01:02:53.780
- You can have it.


01:02:53.780 --> 01:02:54.600
- Yes.


01:02:54.600 --> 01:02:55.440
(laughing)


01:02:55.440 --> 01:02:56.760
- I love Chuck Norris, yeah.


01:02:56.760 --> 01:02:58.660
He only makes programming better.


01:02:58.660 --> 01:02:59.500
- He does.


01:02:59.500 --> 01:03:00.340
(laughing)


01:03:00.340 --> 01:03:04.500
Interesting, so silly is like faker, but silly.


01:03:04.500 --> 01:03:05.340
It says.


01:03:05.340 --> 01:03:06.160
- That's silly.


01:03:06.160 --> 01:03:07.000
(laughing)


01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:07.840
- I love it, I love it.


01:03:07.840 --> 01:03:08.660
All right, cool.


01:03:08.660 --> 01:03:10.260
Well, thank you both for being here.


01:03:10.260 --> 01:03:13.460
If people wanna get started with some of the JWST data


01:03:13.460 --> 01:03:16.160
or some of the libraries, you know, what would you say?


01:03:16.160 --> 01:03:18.160
- Go to our archive.


01:03:18.160 --> 01:03:19.940
- Yeah.


01:03:19.940 --> 01:03:20.440
Yeah.


01:03:20.440 --> 01:03:23.420
It's archive.stsei.edu.


01:03:23.420 --> 01:03:26.440
And as soon as the GenMST data is coming through


01:03:26.440 --> 01:03:29.340
that they can look at, the public available data


01:03:29.340 --> 01:03:30.700
will be there.


01:03:30.700 --> 01:03:31.180
Yeah.


01:03:31.180 --> 01:03:32.500
And there's tools already there.


01:03:32.500 --> 01:03:34.940
You can see the images, what they look like.


01:03:34.940 --> 01:03:36.780
You can play with them a little bit.


01:03:36.780 --> 01:03:37.340
So it's not--


01:03:37.340 --> 01:03:38.540
You don't even have to know astronomy.


01:03:38.540 --> 01:03:40.420
They have both the FITS formats that Megan


01:03:40.420 --> 01:03:41.800
was talking about from scientists,


01:03:41.800 --> 01:03:43.940
and they have plain old JPEG preview images for folks


01:03:43.940 --> 01:03:47.300
to just browse and get a quick look at the sky.


01:03:47.300 --> 01:03:48.500
OK, fantastic.


01:03:48.500 --> 01:03:49.420
All right.


01:03:49.420 --> 01:03:51.380
Well, Megan and Mike, thank you so much for being here.


01:03:51.380 --> 01:03:55.140
It's been great to chat JWST and space in general with you.


01:03:55.140 --> 01:03:56.700
Yeah, thank you so much.


01:03:56.700 --> 01:03:57.180
It was fun.


01:03:57.180 --> 01:03:57.580
Take care.


01:03:57.580 --> 01:03:57.940
Yeah.


01:03:57.940 --> 01:03:58.300
You bet.


01:03:58.300 --> 01:03:58.620
Bye.


01:03:58.620 --> 01:04:08.620
[BLANK_AUDIO]
