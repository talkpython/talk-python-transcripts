00:00:03,340 --> 00:00:06,800
Christopher Trudeau: Have you ever thought about getting your small product into production, but are worried about

2
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:11,920
Christopher Trudeau: the cost of the big cloud providers? Or maybe you think your current cloud service is over-architected

3
00:00:11,990 --> 00:00:16,900
Christopher Trudeau: and costing you too much? Well, in this episode, we interview Michael Kennedy, author of "Talk

4
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:21,780
Christopher Trudeau: Python in Production," a new book that guides you through deploying web apps at scale with

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,660
Christopher Trudeau: right-sized engineering. This is "Talk Python To Me," episode 531, recorded November 26,

6
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:35,880
Christopher Trudeau: 2025. Welcome to Talk Python To Me, a weekly podcast on Python. This is your guest host,

15
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:16,300
Christopher Trudeau: Michael, welcome to talk Python to me.

16
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:17,740
Christopher Trudeau: You know, I looked it up.

17
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:21,300
Christopher Trudeau: You've been on the show more than anyone else, but in case there's new listeners,

18
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:22,740
Christopher Trudeau: tell us a bit about yourself.

19
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:25,000
Michael Kennedy: Incredible, incredible.

20
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:27,020
Michael Kennedy: Good to be here with you, Christopher.

21
00:01:28,979 --> 00:01:33,140
Michael Kennedy: So a bit of a turn of the tables, I would say.

22
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:37,040
Michael Kennedy: And long-time listeners, I'm sure they

23
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,880
Michael Kennedy: know all the little details because I work them in here

24
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:40,220
Michael Kennedy: and there.

25
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:42,280
Michael Kennedy: I think that's kind of fun to just make things personal.

26
00:01:44,259 --> 00:01:46,340
Michael Kennedy: But I've also said this on the show,

27
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:50,140
Michael Kennedy: and I'm sure it's a surprising fact that you know as well.

28
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:53,720
Michael Kennedy: but over half of the people in the Python space

29
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:55,080
Michael Kennedy: have only been here for two years.

30
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:57,100
Christopher Trudeau: - Yeah, I keep seeing that stat.

31
00:01:57,350 --> 00:01:57,480
Christopher Trudeau: - Yep.

32
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:58,640
Michael Kennedy: - That's crazy, right?

33
00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:01,180
Michael Kennedy: So even if people, you know, I told this story

34
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:03,240
Michael Kennedy: about my background five years ago,

35
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:05,160
Michael Kennedy: like those people weren't here, like half of them.

36
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,900
Michael Kennedy: So crazy, crazy stuff.

37
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:10,300
Michael Kennedy: All right, so my backstory, I was,

38
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:12,900
Michael Kennedy: I thought I would be a mathematician.

39
00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:16,560
Michael Kennedy: I studied math and stuff like that in college,

40
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:21,700
Michael Kennedy: was working on my PhD and started doing a bunch of work

41
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:25,780
Michael Kennedy: with silicon graphics, mainframe,

42
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:28,700
Michael Kennedy: supercomputer type stuff so that I could do my math research.

43
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:30,660
Michael Kennedy: And I realized, wow, this programming stuff

44
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:31,860
Michael Kennedy: is way more fun than math.

45
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:33,760
Michael Kennedy: How do I change gears?

46
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,360
Michael Kennedy: And so that was like 1998, 99.

47
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:38,720
Michael Kennedy: Haven't looked back.

48
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:39,920
Michael Kennedy: I've been programming since then.

49
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:43,400
Michael Kennedy: And super fun, a couple of languages.

50
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:47,540
Michael Kennedy: And around 10, 11 years ago, started Talk Python.

51
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:52,300
Michael Kennedy: A year after that, quit my job, made Talk Python my full-time job,

52
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,780
Michael Kennedy: started offering courses as well.

53
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:56,700
Michael Kennedy: That's something that people don't necessarily know,

54
00:02:57,730 --> 00:03:00,260
Michael Kennedy: that sometimes they'll ask, well, what do you do for your job, actually?

55
00:03:00,290 --> 00:03:01,760
Michael Kennedy: I'm like, well, we're doing it.

56
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:07,820
Michael Kennedy: So anyway, that's me, a super fan of Python,

57
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:09,400
Michael Kennedy: a super fan of programming.

58
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,120
Michael Kennedy: Every day I wake up just like, wow, how awesome is today?

59
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:16,440
Michael Kennedy: that like, look at all the new stuff that came out that we learned that we can do, right?

60
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:19,800
Michael Kennedy: Like new libraries, AI stuff these days.

61
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:22,260
Christopher Trudeau: Yeah, there's always plenty to talk about.

62
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:23,760
Michael Kennedy: It's incredible times.

63
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:24,880
Michael Kennedy: It's incredible times.

64
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:30,840
Christopher Trudeau: And you've added a new trophy to the mantle, I guess?

65
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:31,900
Christopher Trudeau: You've written a book.

66
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:34,300
Michael Kennedy: I have written a book.

67
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:39,100
Michael Kennedy: And, you know, that's a little bit, I'll put it this way.

68
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:40,860
Michael Kennedy: It's not something I ever saw myself doing.

69
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:43,900
Michael Kennedy: But I'm really excited that I did.

70
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:50,120
Michael Kennedy: And yeah, it took, I spent a couple of months properly writing it.

71
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:51,820
Michael Kennedy: You know, I really put in my energy in.

72
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:55,140
Michael Kennedy: And like all projects, you think you're about done.

73
00:03:57,260 --> 00:04:01,040
Christopher Trudeau: Yeah, that first 80% is nothing like the last 80%.

74
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:03,580
Michael Kennedy: No, and the last 5% is long.

75
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:07,000
Michael Kennedy: You know, and it's not just the book.

76
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,960
Michael Kennedy: It's like, okay, well, where am I going to sell it?

77
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,800
Michael Kennedy: okay, well, Amazon, and then I'll self-publish,

78
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:12,800
Michael Kennedy: or do I use a publisher?

79
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:14,680
Michael Kennedy: And you end up self-publishing it,

80
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:16,940
Michael Kennedy: but then you're like, how do I?

81
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:19,100
Michael Kennedy: You know, all these things you learn for the first time.

82
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:21,700
Michael Kennedy: Like, how do I get it into Amazon to sell even?

83
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:23,220
Michael Kennedy: And there's a bunch of decisions.

84
00:04:24,139 --> 00:04:28,780
Christopher Trudeau: And I can tell you, even with having taken the publishing route,

85
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:29,700
Christopher Trudeau: it's no easier.

86
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:32,400
Christopher Trudeau: It's just that it goes dark for two months,

87
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,540
Christopher Trudeau: and then all of a sudden it's like,

88
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:34,780
Christopher Trudeau: you need to do this by yesterday.

89
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:38,800
Christopher Trudeau: So, yeah, it's not necessarily an advantage either way,

90
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:45,200
Michael Kennedy: I think. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I was really on the fence and I thought, look, let me just try this

91
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:51,380
Michael Kennedy: myself. I got a few podcast listeners and I can let them know about it. And an audience helps.

92
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:58,320
Michael Kennedy: I honestly think it was probably the right choice for me. And for those who haven't come across it

93
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:03,719
Christopher Trudeau: yet, do you want to give us the one paragraph version? Yeah. So the book is called Talk Python

94
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:08,920
Michael Kennedy: in production. There are other books that are, I'm pretty sure one is called Python in production,

95
00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:14,120
Michael Kennedy: or other things about how do you get your Python app into production. But this is talk Python in

96
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:20,840
Michael Kennedy: production because it's sort of a dual role storytelling vehicle. Obviously it's nonfiction,

97
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:29,039
Michael Kennedy: it's a technical book. But the idea was, let me tell not a generic story of how you might run some

98
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:34,460
Michael Kennedy: of your Python code in production, mostly APIs, web apps, databases, like that kind of stuff,

99
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:42,560
Michael Kennedy: right? Not a general story of that, but my story, right? I've been on this journey of

100
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:53,280
Michael Kennedy: not complete noob, but pretty significantly lost getting my original Python app out into the world

101
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:56,860
Michael Kennedy: to pretty confident running stuff

102
00:05:57,810 --> 00:06:01,200
Michael Kennedy: in, I think, a simpler than usual way,

103
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:02,620
Michael Kennedy: in a good way.

104
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:03,400
Christopher Trudeau: Right.

105
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:07,040
Christopher Trudeau: One of the things I really liked about the book is

106
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:10,000
Christopher Trudeau: it's not quite changing gears,

107
00:06:10,130 --> 00:06:13,300
Christopher Trudeau: but you do a nice mix of sort of the

108
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:16,040
Christopher Trudeau: decision-making process versus the

109
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:17,520
Christopher Trudeau: here's exactly what I did.

110
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:20,040
Christopher Trudeau: And so you get a little bit of both.

111
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:22,359
Christopher Trudeau: And honestly, the decision-making process

112
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:25,960
Christopher Trudeau: is something I find often isn't there in a lot of work.

113
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:29,180
Christopher Trudeau: You know, your standard blog post is always,

114
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:32,260
Christopher Trudeau: well, and then add exactly this to exactly this file.

115
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,200
Christopher Trudeau: But I think I really, really sort of enjoyed the,

116
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:38,860
Christopher Trudeau: and this is what I tried, and this is why I changed.

117
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:41,200
Christopher Trudeau: And you're very kind of humble about it.

118
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:43,820
Christopher Trudeau: Like a lot of folks who write this kind of content,

119
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:45,340
Christopher Trudeau: it's thou shalt do this.

120
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:47,620
Christopher Trudeau: And you're like, this is the way, I told you.

121
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:48,820
Christopher Trudeau: Yeah, this worked for me.

122
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:53,980
Christopher Trudeau: and uh yeah so so i really like the fact that you've you've kind of blended that in

123
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:59,700
Christopher Trudeau: what what made you decide to do this like that what there so you said you didn't really have

124
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:04,900
Michael Kennedy: the itch to go down the path so uh what i'm not sure i didn't have the itch i just didn't think

125
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:11,840
Michael Kennedy: that it was something i was capable of ah i see okay you know what i mean not not that i didn't

126
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:17,579
Michael Kennedy: think if i literally took two years of my life and went into like a cabin the row style or something

127
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:19,540
Michael Kennedy: I could come out with a book, I'm pretty sure.

128
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:24,440
Michael Kennedy: But given all the constraints of like, I have a family and I got to keep Talk Python running.

129
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:27,780
Michael Kennedy: Like in that sense, I didn't think I would be able to do it.

130
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:30,980
Christopher Trudeau: Yeah, it's perseverance more than anything else, I think.

131
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,240
Christopher Trudeau: Yeah, for sure.

132
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:33,160
Michael Kennedy: Exactly.

133
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:35,340
Michael Kennedy: So, yeah, go ahead.

134
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:35,640
Michael Kennedy: Go ahead.

135
00:07:35,850 --> 00:07:36,300
Michael Kennedy: No, no, go ahead.

136
00:07:36,430 --> 00:07:40,240
Michael Kennedy: Well, you know, so why did I write it?

137
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:42,600
Michael Kennedy: Two reasons.

138
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:44,400
Michael Kennedy: One, I think it's an interesting story.

139
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:47,240
Michael Kennedy: And I thought people would enjoy hearing it.

140
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,160
Michael Kennedy: like the personal side that you mentioned a little bit.

141
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:50,500
Michael Kennedy: I thought people would appreciate that.

142
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,180
Michael Kennedy: And maybe more significantly,

143
00:07:55,170 --> 00:07:57,560
Michael Kennedy: I feel like a lot of the advice out there

144
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:00,580
Michael Kennedy: in the tech space in general,

145
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:02,640
Michael Kennedy: but for now we're focused on like,

146
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:03,740
Michael Kennedy: how do I deploy my app?

147
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:05,920
Michael Kennedy: Sort of like Python plus DevOps type of thing.

148
00:08:06,670 --> 00:08:08,640
Michael Kennedy: But I think a lot of the advice out there

149
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:13,880
Michael Kennedy: is a little bit of a flex in the sense that,

150
00:08:14,590 --> 00:08:15,920
Michael Kennedy: oh, look at this.

151
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:20,100
Michael Kennedy: we're using these seven services and then this technology, and then we're auto

152
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:21,060
Michael Kennedy: scaling it with that.

153
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:23,500
Michael Kennedy: And then we have these logs pumped over to this other thing.

154
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:25,060
Michael Kennedy: You're like, Whoa, okay.

155
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:25,940
Michael Kennedy: That's kind of cool.

156
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:30,700
Michael Kennedy: But a lot of people who just have an app and they just want to go from like, it

157
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:33,719
Michael Kennedy: works on my machine to look what I made.

158
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,380
Michael Kennedy: They see that and go, I can't do that.

159
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:38,360
Michael Kennedy: You know what?

160
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:39,000
Michael Kennedy: It's not for me.

161
00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:46,080
Michael Kennedy: It's just like, I can't spend $500 on this infrastructure and I don't feel

162
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:49,660
Michael Kennedy: if I don't have all, you know, like completely geo

163
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:54,320
Michael Kennedy: distributed redundant databases and like, you don't need that.

164
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:55,520
Michael Kennedy: You know what I mean?

165
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:58,080
Michael Kennedy: And people keep asking me like, Hey, Michael, can you give me some advice?

166
00:08:58,250 --> 00:08:59,540
Michael Kennedy: I'm like, well, not that.

167
00:09:00,350 --> 00:09:02,860
Michael Kennedy: And finally, I'm like, let me just tell the story, you know?

168
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:05,900
Michael Kennedy: And so that was a big motivation.

169
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:07,780
Christopher Trudeau: You see it in industry a lot.

170
00:09:07,810 --> 00:09:11,320
Christopher Trudeau: it's sometimes referred to as, you know, resume based architecture, right?

171
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:14,320
Christopher Trudeau: Like it's a, do we need this or is this because I'm trying to learn?

172
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:14,640
Christopher Trudeau: Yes.

173
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:20,480
Christopher Trudeau: and I think there's always that, oh, some of it's aspirational, right?

174
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:21,740
Christopher Trudeau: I, I, we will be Netflix.

175
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:26,480
Christopher Trudeau: And so, you know, we, we need to be on every continent and all the rest of it.

176
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:27,400
Christopher Trudeau: And,

177
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:28,180
Michael Kennedy: Right, right.

178
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:29,360
Michael Kennedy: It's, it's very aspirational.

179
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:30,960
Michael Kennedy: It's like, I'm going to build this app.

180
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:33,580
Michael Kennedy: And the reason I'm building it is it's going to take off.

181
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:37,180
Michael Kennedy: And that day when the hockey stick hits, I'm ready.

182
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:37,720
Christopher Trudeau: Yeah.

183
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:38,920
Michael Kennedy: You know what I mean?

184
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:44,200
Christopher Trudeau: There's also a, you know, I think there's a, a lack of

185
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:51,380
Christopher Trudeau: recognition of the cost of both in energy and money uh energy as in human effort i'm not talking

186
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:59,480
Christopher Trudeau: about electricity uh of the next one percent right so like getting from 90 uptime to 95 uptime costs

187
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:06,460
Christopher Trudeau: something getting from 95 to 96 costs more than that and getting from 96 like and once you're

188
00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:11,860
Christopher Trudeau: getting into like the four nines five nines thing and then you know cloud flare goes down and you're

189
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:19,280
Michael Kennedy: all screwed anyways, right? So it's so it's so ironic. It is 100% ironic that you take all these

190
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:23,540
Michael Kennedy: steps and you employ all these services. And it's the complexity of those services that went down

191
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:28,740
Michael Kennedy: like, you know, this show will come out in a couple weeks, but it we're just on the eve of

192
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:37,000
Michael Kennedy: basically three weeks of important things going down. First AWS. Yeah. Then Azure and then GitHub.

193
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:39,600
Michael Kennedy: And also, and then Cloudflare, so let's put that as four,

194
00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:41,820
Michael Kennedy: within three weeks, right?

195
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:46,020
Michael Kennedy: And the AWS one was like, the reason it went down

196
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:49,320
Michael Kennedy: is DynamoDB had some sort of DNS problem.

197
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:52,580
Michael Kennedy: Even if you're not using that, the thing you're using,

198
00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:56,660
Michael Kennedy: like Lambda, depends upon DynamoDB for itself to work.

199
00:10:56,660 --> 00:10:59,800
Michael Kennedy: So it was just like a cascade of kabang, right?

200
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:01,360
Michael Kennedy: And that's a little bit of this complexity.

201
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,580
Michael Kennedy: The more complexity you buy in, even if it's not yours,

202
00:11:06,070 --> 00:11:07,140
Michael Kennedy: it is yours in a sense.

203
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:10,960
Christopher Trudeau: Yeah. And there's, there's always humans involved, right? So you're always, there's,

204
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:16,500
Christopher Trudeau: there's always fallibility somewhere, right? Although one of the arguments I have seen

205
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:21,640
Christopher Trudeau: recently in response to the Cloudflare outages, the good news is if you're, you know, I saw some

206
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:25,040
Christopher Trudeau: articles that were like, well, you shouldn't be dependent on Cloudflare. And I saw the counter

207
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:29,760
Christopher Trudeau: articles were basically, you know what, when half the internet's down, no one's hassling you that

208
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:35,320
Christopher Trudeau: your app is down because half the internet is down. So yeah, that's true. There is an excuse when it

209
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:35,940
Christopher Trudeau: isn't your fault.

210
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,460
Christopher Trudeau: So yeah, anyways.

211
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:38,400
Christopher Trudeau: That is true.

212
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:43,400
Michael Kennedy: And you don't see what Cloudflare saved people.

213
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:43,920
Michael Kennedy: Yes.

214
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:46,120
Michael Kennedy: I'm not using Cloudflare.

215
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:47,260
Michael Kennedy: I actually use bunny.net.

216
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:52,200
Michael Kennedy: But CDNs make it possible for your app

217
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:55,100
Michael Kennedy: to survive these spikes in ways that they very well may not

218
00:11:55,580 --> 00:11:57,760
Michael Kennedy: without, and certainly the DDoS type of stuff

219
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:58,800
Michael Kennedy: that they protect against.

220
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:01,840
Christopher Trudeau: And I use it simply for certificates.

221
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:08,120
Christopher Trudeau: Like Google decided everyone shall be HTTPS, even my sites that don't need it.

222
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:13,640
Christopher Trudeau: And rather than try to figure out automation for let's encrypt has gotten a lot better.

223
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:17,840
Christopher Trudeau: But when I first started it, it was like, and I need this and I need this and I need this.

224
00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:21,500
Christopher Trudeau: And then the cron job could go down or it's like, or I can stick cloud fair in front of it.

225
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:23,420
Christopher Trudeau: And I never have to think about it ever again.

226
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:23,740
Christopher Trudeau: Right.

227
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:24,960
Christopher Trudeau: So yeah, like exactly.

228
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:26,580
Christopher Trudeau: There's a little bit of value that way.

229
00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:28,300
Michael Kennedy: So yeah, there definitely, definitely is.

230
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:31,060
Michael Kennedy: Another thing I want to kind of bring back a little bit,

231
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,640
Michael Kennedy: you opened this segment on,

232
00:12:34,430 --> 00:12:37,560
Michael Kennedy: you said, like I shared the human side of the story

233
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:39,040
Michael Kennedy: in kind of a humble way.

234
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:41,340
Michael Kennedy: That was certainly something,

235
00:12:41,430 --> 00:12:42,880
Michael Kennedy: that was one of the main goals, like I said.

236
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:45,840
Michael Kennedy: I think it's just a continuation of the podcast.

237
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:48,200
Michael Kennedy: I started the podcast 10 years ago,

238
00:12:48,270 --> 00:12:50,540
Michael Kennedy: and I'm like, when I got into Python,

239
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:52,120
Michael Kennedy: there were no Python podcasts.

240
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:54,380
Michael Kennedy: There had been, but there were none at the time.

241
00:12:54,430 --> 00:12:55,800
Michael Kennedy: And I'm like, there's all these cool libraries.

242
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:58,700
Michael Kennedy: I want to hear the stories and the humanity.

243
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:04,940
Michael Kennedy: And you go to the documentation and you're like, cool technology, sterile as can be.

244
00:13:05,499 --> 00:13:10,580
Michael Kennedy: And the reason technology is interesting is not just because there's an API I can call this,

245
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:14,180
Michael Kennedy: but it's like, it's a journey and it's a story.

246
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:17,600
Michael Kennedy: And it's, so I just wanted to do that again in the book.

247
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:19,180
Christopher Trudeau: It's all problem solving, right?

248
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:22,920
Christopher Trudeau: And there has to have been a problem for someone to want to solve it,

249
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Christopher Trudeau: which means there's got to have been people involved in trying to figure out what that is.

250
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:55,400
Michael Kennedy: I think a lot of people maybe, I don't know, I shouldn't speak for people. It seems to me though, like a lot of people, they look at a technology and they think they just assess it as a dry, sterile sort of thing on its own. That was created in a context, right? Why was celery created? Not just so I can send events to it and like, you know, add more complexity and asynchronous. It solved a real problem.

251
00:13:55,540 --> 00:14:03,320
Michael Kennedy: And if you hear and you understand and you follow that journey, you're like, I see this is where this come from and why it exists.

252
00:14:03,650 --> 00:14:05,880
Michael Kennedy: Then you can decide, is it for me?

253
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:06,460
Michael Kennedy: Yes.

254
00:14:06,570 --> 00:14:06,680
Michael Kennedy: Right?

255
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:15,340
Christopher Trudeau: Well, and I think doubly so in the open source space because this is all volunteer work.

256
00:14:16,050 --> 00:14:21,780
Christopher Trudeau: And so knowing a little bit about who's doing what and humanizing that a little bit.

257
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:22,860
Christopher Trudeau: Right.

258
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:23,680
Christopher Trudeau: Their motivation.

259
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:24,420
Christopher Trudeau: Yeah.

260
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:26,220
Christopher Trudeau: And it's also easier to be grateful, right?

261
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:28,440
Christopher Trudeau: Like this isn't some soulless corporate machine.

262
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:31,000
Christopher Trudeau: There was, there was a reason behind this and a driver behind it.

263
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:36,260
Christopher Trudeau: So you've, inside the book, you've, you've added a couple of things that are a

264
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:42,020
Christopher Trudeau: little sort of non-standard, like the audio reader briefs and the galleries that you want

265
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:47,300
Christopher Trudeau: to give a quick rundown and speaking of, and speaking of motivation, what, what motivated

266
00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:48,500
Christopher Trudeau: you to include those things?

267
00:14:50,379 --> 00:14:52,060
Michael Kennedy: So let me describe what they are first.

268
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:54,400
Michael Kennedy: Cause they are weird, but they're weird in a good way.

269
00:14:54,540 --> 00:15:02,380
Michael Kennedy: I think. So if you go to the book, my vision was somebody's going to be reading this very likely on

270
00:15:02,390 --> 00:15:13,800
Michael Kennedy: a Kindle. And if I go and put really nice diagrams, pictures, whatever, how good is that going to look

271
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:18,480
Michael Kennedy: in a Kindle paperwhite, black and white? You know what I mean? Like how hard is that going to be

272
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:24,260
Michael Kennedy: to read? I think it's going to be hard is what I decided. And so what I ended up doing is I said,

273
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:30,780
Michael Kennedy: okay, how, how can I make it better for people so that when they want to work with code,

274
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:37,180
Michael Kennedy: it's not trapped inside your Kindle or your iPad, Apple books or wherever you read it,

275
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:43,580
Michael Kennedy: but it's super accessible, right? So what I did is I created some things I called galleries and

276
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:49,820
Michael Kennedy: there's a code gallery, a figure gallery and a links gallery. And these are just like,

277
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:55,840
Michael Kennedy: they're kind of like an index of those things so like the links one just says hey here's all the

278
00:15:55,920 --> 00:16:02,640
Michael Kennedy: urls that we talked about in chapter 10 or chapter 11 and just the sentence that contains them so

279
00:16:02,830 --> 00:16:06,320
Michael Kennedy: instead of trying to go back through and flipping through the book like where was that thing they

280
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:10,920
Michael Kennedy: talked about right like no you just go to the gallery and you click on the chapter or you just

281
00:16:11,010 --> 00:16:17,659
Michael Kennedy: do command f there it is you know what i mean and also for especially for the figures like it's um

282
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:26,560
Michael Kennedy: all it has like 2,000 or 4,000 by whatever level pictures that you're not even allowed to put into

283
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:32,320
Michael Kennedy: like a Kindle book they're like uh no we're gonna redo those rescale those images for you down to

284
00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:38,320
Michael Kennedy: something fuzzy right so if you want to read like little tiny texts I put it there so that's the

285
00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:46,960
Michael Kennedy: galleries and I was just maybe a little bit more backstory here is when I wrote this I've worked

286
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:52,620
Michael Kennedy: with other type of editing things, any tools, I'm just like, I need to write this and I need to get

287
00:16:52,690 --> 00:16:59,560
Michael Kennedy: this done in a super fluid way. So I'm just going to write in Markdown. I'm just writing in Markdown.

288
00:16:59,970 --> 00:17:05,620
Michael Kennedy: And so what I did is, of course, there's book publishing things that you can put Markdown into

289
00:17:05,709 --> 00:17:11,499
Michael Kennedy: and so on. But I'm like, I'm just going to write one Markdown file per chapter and then write some

290
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:19,520
Michael Kennedy: Python program to assemble that in interesting ways and then turn that into an EPUB or PDF or

291
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:24,780
Michael Kennedy: Kindle or whatever through something called Pandoc. Are you familiar with Pandoc? I've heard of it,

292
00:17:24,939 --> 00:17:29,760
Michael Kennedy: yeah. If you go and look, for people who don't know what Pandoc is, if you go look at Pandoc,

293
00:17:29,850 --> 00:17:35,960
Michael Kennedy: it has right on the web page, it has this like fuzzy thing on the right. It's like gray fuzzy.

294
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:37,520
Michael Kennedy: You're like, what is that?

295
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:45,140
Michael Kennedy: This thing on the right shows you all the formats that go in and all the formats that can come out.

296
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:47,180
Michael Kennedy: And it's insane.

297
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:51,740
Michael Kennedy: Like you can't even – the line is just – the line is connecting the graphs of these things.

298
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:53,200
Michael Kennedy: It's just a black blob.

299
00:17:53,500 --> 00:18:00,820
Michael Kennedy: Like I could put a hadocked document, whatever the heck that is, and convert that to a docbook 4.

300
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:01,540
Christopher Trudeau: Right.

301
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:02,860
Michael Kennedy: I mean it's insane.

302
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:14,560
Michael Kennedy: Okay, so what I did is I built this Python, simple Python thing that reassembles Markdown in certain ways and then feed the final thing that I built into Pandoc to get the different e-book formats.

303
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:15,720
Christopher Trudeau: Right, right. Okay.

304
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:26,060
Michael Kennedy: But then it occurred to me, so I didn't start out with these gallery type things or other stuff, but I'm like, well, this is just Python against Markdown.

305
00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:31,100
Michael Kennedy: surely I can start pulling out all the links and pulling out the images and then writing them

306
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:35,980
Michael Kennedy: somewhere else and then just committing that to GitHub. So once, you know, it's kind of just the

307
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:40,960
Michael Kennedy: standard story of Python or programming in general, but I think it's extra common in Python. It's like,

308
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:47,940
Michael Kennedy: I started solving the problem with Python and once that was in place, it's like the next block and

309
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:51,500
Michael Kennedy: the next thing is just like, that's easy now and that's easy. And these three things are also easy.

310
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:53,500
Michael Kennedy: Let's just do that and just keep adding to it.

311
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:58,840
Michael Kennedy: So that's where they came from is one, wanting to make sure people had a good

312
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:02,820
Michael Kennedy: experience with like code resources, pictures and so on.

313
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:07,400
Michael Kennedy: But also it's just kind of following the lead of like, Hey, let's just keep going.

314
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,240
Christopher Trudeau: Well, and it's one of the beauties of an ebook.

315
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:14,860
Christopher Trudeau: If dead tree copies, those things cost money.

316
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:19,620
Christopher Trudeau: And so it's like, Oh, I've got a great idea for six more appendices.

317
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:21,980
Christopher Trudeau: And that's when you start going, oh, wait a second.

318
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:24,700
Christopher Trudeau: I'm not going to add 300 pages to a 200-page book.

319
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:25,920
Christopher Trudeau: Yeah, exactly.

320
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:32,780
Christopher Trudeau: With an e-book, you can go, oh, yeah, here, we can make this referenceable in a couple different ways.

321
00:19:33,550 --> 00:19:33,920
Michael Kennedy: Right, yeah.

322
00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:38,380
Michael Kennedy: It's like it duplicates the images into maybe 20 more pages or something.

323
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:40,300
Michael Kennedy: But it's an e-book.

324
00:19:40,410 --> 00:19:40,840
Michael Kennedy: Who cares?

325
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:41,520
Christopher Trudeau: Exactly.

326
00:19:41,790 --> 00:19:42,260
Christopher Trudeau: Yeah, yeah.

327
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:49,480
Christopher Trudeau: So over the history of the show, I think I've become familiar with your AI journey.

328
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:53,840
Christopher Trudeau: and recently it sounds like you've bought.

329
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:56,380
Christopher Trudeau: You're a fairly big proponent.

330
00:19:57,420 --> 00:20:00,640
Christopher Trudeau: That being said, there's still a Made by Humans logo inside.

331
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:01,700
Christopher Trudeau: Yeah.

332
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:06,980
Christopher Trudeau: So I'm going to put you on the spot.

333
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:08,500
Christopher Trudeau: Put me on the spot.

334
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:09,160
Christopher Trudeau: Do you believe in it or not?

335
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:11,120
Michael Kennedy: Do I believe in it or not?

336
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:13,780
Christopher Trudeau: So why Made by Humans?

337
00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:14,800
Michael Kennedy: It's a good question.

338
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:16,660
Michael Kennedy: Yeah, it's a really good question.

339
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:41,820
Michael Kennedy: So I think there's a weariness of content generated by AI or assisted by AI meant to attract attention and build authoritative feelings about a thing when that authority or that skill set is not necessarily yours.

340
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:45,720
Michael Kennedy: And that I still very much do not like.

341
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:50,040
Michael Kennedy: If I wanted to create a blog, I mean, I guess I could do it.

342
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:52,680
Michael Kennedy: It'd be a fun experiment, I guess, in sort of an evil way.

343
00:20:52,820 --> 00:21:03,080
Michael Kennedy: Like, what if I just go create a completely random blog and I just have chat just bust out an article twice a day, every day, of the thing that's on the top of Hacker News or something?

344
00:21:03,130 --> 00:21:05,000
Michael Kennedy: You know, just like, you could do that.

345
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:07,520
Michael Kennedy: And actually, it might even be interesting.

346
00:21:07,650 --> 00:21:08,780
Michael Kennedy: I don't really even know.

347
00:21:09,330 --> 00:21:11,140
Michael Kennedy: But I don't want that, right?

348
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:20,500
Michael Kennedy: And for this, I wanted to share my story, not have AI create a book that has bullet points of my story.

349
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:21,440
Christopher Trudeau: Right. Yeah.

350
00:21:22,110 --> 00:21:24,260
Michael Kennedy: So for me, it was important to write this.

351
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:27,840
Michael Kennedy: I wrote it 100% by Michael.

352
00:21:28,330 --> 00:21:30,520
Michael Kennedy: Right. It took me a lot of work.

353
00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:35,900
Michael Kennedy: People, I know, it got posted on Reddit and I think Hacker News somewhere.

354
00:21:35,990 --> 00:21:36,660
Michael Kennedy: There was a bunch of comments.

355
00:21:37,050 --> 00:21:39,400
Michael Kennedy: And they're like, oh, this thing is definitely just AI generated.

356
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:40,160
Michael Kennedy: I'm like, you know what?

357
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:44,260
Michael Kennedy: There was a lot of months that I spent on this that were felt not AI generated to me.

358
00:21:45,559 --> 00:21:52,560
Christopher Trudeau: If it makes you feel any better, I've had actually comments pop up on some of my video courses claiming that my voiceover was AI.

359
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:56,300
Christopher Trudeau: So that's just the world we live in now.

360
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:58,920
Michael Kennedy: It's the world we live in, and there's not a lot you can do with it.

361
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:02,440
Michael Kennedy: So just kind of put a little bit of a pushback against that.

362
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:08,280
Michael Kennedy: I did put like a prefix sort of thing and a label that says made by humans.

363
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:12,560
Michael Kennedy: And what's really funny is I don't know if I can actually find that section.

364
00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:15,200
Michael Kennedy: I don't think I can on just the web part.

365
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:17,140
Michael Kennedy: But I made a picture.

366
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:18,480
Michael Kennedy: Maybe I did.

367
00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:19,400
Michael Kennedy: Humans?

368
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:19,800
Michael Kennedy: No.

369
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:22,600
Michael Kennedy: Anyway, I made a picture that I drew.

370
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:26,300
Michael Kennedy: I literally am a big fan of Pixelmator Pro.

371
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:28,360
Michael Kennedy: I went into Pixelmator Pro and I drew it.

372
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:30,800
Michael Kennedy: And they said, proof that this is AI generated.

373
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:33,060
Michael Kennedy: Look at that stupid made by humans graphic.

374
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:34,240
Michael Kennedy: It's clearly AI generated.

375
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:35,740
Michael Kennedy: It would be way better if it worked.

376
00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:36,780
Christopher Trudeau: It obviously wasn't generated, yes.

377
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:44,360
Michael Kennedy: Okay, so how do I square that with me actually being quite a fan of AI stuff these days?

378
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:51,920
Michael Kennedy: Like, I'm, let's do like a looking back and then looking forward.

379
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,300
Michael Kennedy: So let's go back 30 years.

380
00:22:54,580 --> 00:23:02,560
Michael Kennedy: I'm also a fan of using editors that when I hit dot, tell me what I can do with that function, class, variable, etc.

381
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:06,540
Michael Kennedy: So I'm not constantly in the documentation, right?

382
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:09,180
Michael Kennedy: Does that make me not a programmer?

383
00:23:09,670 --> 00:23:10,360
Michael Kennedy: I don't think so.

384
00:23:10,460 --> 00:23:11,280
Michael Kennedy: I'm still writing code.

385
00:23:11,310 --> 00:23:12,360
Michael Kennedy: I'm still thinking architecture.

386
00:23:12,580 --> 00:23:14,760
Michael Kennedy: I'm just not in the documentation constantly.

387
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:18,360
Michael Kennedy: And honestly, I maybe don't memorize every little function

388
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:22,360
Michael Kennedy: and field of everything in the standard library, right?

389
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:23,580
Michael Kennedy: It's fine.

390
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:25,540
Michael Kennedy: That's not where our time is best spent.

391
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:27,940
Michael Kennedy: And I feel that way about AI programming.

392
00:23:28,050 --> 00:23:32,140
Michael Kennedy: I think there are pitfalls and there are worrisome aspects of it.

393
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:38,760
Michael Kennedy: but you can use some of these agentic AI tools these days

394
00:23:39,260 --> 00:23:41,620
Michael Kennedy: to think in so much higher level building blocks.

395
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:44,460
Michael Kennedy: Think of like, I'm working in a function

396
00:23:44,830 --> 00:23:45,800
Michael Kennedy: and I'm writing this part,

397
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:48,660
Michael Kennedy: or I'm working in design patterns

398
00:23:48,770 --> 00:23:50,920
Michael Kennedy: and I can think of these big sort of concepts.

399
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:53,700
Michael Kennedy: Well, with this AI stuff, you can just say,

400
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:55,320
Michael Kennedy: what if we had a login page?

401
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:57,840
Michael Kennedy: Oh, we have a login page.

402
00:23:58,060 --> 00:24:00,200
Michael Kennedy: Now, what other building block do I need?

403
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:03,240
Michael Kennedy: Like the building blocks are so big

404
00:24:03,660 --> 00:24:07,340
Michael Kennedy: and sort of non-critical software,

405
00:24:07,860 --> 00:24:09,080
Michael Kennedy: non-super important software

406
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:14,740
Michael Kennedy: becomes so much cheaper than before.

407
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:17,260
Michael Kennedy: You're like, I wish I had a little utility

408
00:24:17,330 --> 00:24:18,360
Michael Kennedy: or app that would do this,

409
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:20,540
Michael Kennedy: but it just definitely doesn't justify

410
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:21,980
Michael Kennedy: two weeks of work to have it.

411
00:24:22,050 --> 00:24:25,040
Michael Kennedy: Like, what if it was a couple of prompts

412
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:25,700
Michael Kennedy: in half an hour?

413
00:24:25,770 --> 00:24:26,700
Michael Kennedy: Like, yeah, well, then I'll have it.

414
00:24:26,910 --> 00:24:27,400
Michael Kennedy: You know what I mean?

415
00:24:27,450 --> 00:24:30,720
Michael Kennedy: And you can, that is transformative

416
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:33,120
Christopher Trudeau: for how we work.

417
00:24:33,340 --> 00:24:37,500
Christopher Trudeau: Yeah, so much of coding is boilerplate, right? So if we can figure out how to make that easier,

418
00:24:37,730 --> 00:24:43,160
Christopher Trudeau: then why not? Right? And I haven't got there with it myself. I don't know whether I will. I'm

419
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:49,660
Christopher Trudeau: definitely a little more suspicious of it than you are, but I copy and paste code all the time. And

420
00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:54,900
Christopher Trudeau: it's not like I'm like, oh, I have to hand tune that. No, it's like, well, I got to copy something

421
00:24:55,140 --> 00:25:00,799
Michael Kennedy: that does that. Yeah. Let me give you a concrete example, because I think it's easy to talk in

422
00:25:00,820 --> 00:25:04,820
Michael Kennedy: generalizations and people are like, well, that's not for me, a bunch of AI slop, which is fair.

423
00:25:06,220 --> 00:25:08,940
Michael Kennedy: But I'll give you an example of one thing. I'm like, this was just such a,

424
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:14,800
Michael Kennedy: such a nuisance and I'm going to fix it. So when I first built Talk Python, the website,

425
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:20,560
Michael Kennedy: 10 years ago, Bootstrap was all the rage, not modern Bootstrap, like old Bootstrap,

426
00:25:21,090 --> 00:25:26,420
Michael Kennedy: right? Which they've completely redone the way that you have to structure your HTML and CSS

427
00:25:28,659 --> 00:25:31,460
Michael Kennedy: completely, incompatibly, several times since then.

428
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:35,580
Michael Kennedy: And until very recently, until this summer,

429
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:38,120
Michael Kennedy: every time I wanted to add a feature or an aspect,

430
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:40,640
Michael Kennedy: like, for example, this whole section that hosts the book,

431
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:42,260
Michael Kennedy: right, I want to add that.

432
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:43,760
Michael Kennedy: Well, you know what I had to do?

433
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:45,840
Michael Kennedy: I had to go write like 10-year-old bootstrap.

434
00:25:45,940 --> 00:25:47,240
Michael Kennedy: And I'm like, oh, I hate it so much.

435
00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:49,840
Michael Kennedy: There's so much nicer tools I could be doing this.

436
00:25:50,620 --> 00:25:54,840
Michael Kennedy: But there's 8,000 lines of HTML and almost as many CSS.

437
00:25:55,660 --> 00:26:03,500
Michael Kennedy: Does it justify me rewriting that much UI so that I can feel a little bit better and use a little bit nicer UI tooling?

438
00:26:04,180 --> 00:26:05,920
Michael Kennedy: No, it definitely doesn't.

439
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:11,720
Michael Kennedy: And so for a couple of years, I'm like, oh, I wish I could do something else, but it's not worth it.

440
00:26:12,260 --> 00:26:16,660
Michael Kennedy: And then I was sitting on my porch, a little back area with my computer in the summer, hanging out.

441
00:26:16,660 --> 00:26:17,240
Michael Kennedy: I'm like, you know what?

442
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:18,260
Michael Kennedy: I bet Claude could do it.

443
00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:22,440
Michael Kennedy: Hey, Claude, rewrite all of this site.

444
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:29,740
Michael Kennedy: make a plan and rewrite it, move it from Bootstrap 3 to Bulma, which is like simple tailwind,

445
00:26:30,230 --> 00:26:36,540
Michael Kennedy: and just completely do it. Four hours later, the whole thing was redone, like 20,000 lines of edits.

446
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:37,400
Christopher Trudeau: Wow.

447
00:26:38,030 --> 00:26:42,200
Michael Kennedy: Done. And it wasn't perfect. I had to go, you messed up a little bit here. And actually,

448
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:46,120
Michael Kennedy: that was right, but that doesn't look good anymore. So could you actually just make it look,

449
00:26:46,190 --> 00:26:49,780
Michael Kennedy: you know what I mean? But I mean, it was like half a day. That work was done.

450
00:26:50,140 --> 00:26:53,260
Michael Kennedy: and that is a different level

451
00:26:54,270 --> 00:26:55,040
Michael Kennedy: no it would have been

452
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:57,940
Michael Kennedy: weeks to a month and it's

453
00:26:57,940 --> 00:26:59,120
Michael Kennedy: the worst kind it's like

454
00:26:59,650 --> 00:27:01,380
Michael Kennedy: okay here's how the grid system used to work

455
00:27:01,470 --> 00:27:03,540
Michael Kennedy: let me restructure the HTML oh you lost

456
00:27:03,590 --> 00:27:05,300
Michael Kennedy: a div whoopsie now

457
00:27:05,490 --> 00:27:07,480
Michael Kennedy: how are you going to untangle this you know what I mean like really

458
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:09,520
Michael Kennedy: really not good stuff and you

459
00:27:09,550 --> 00:27:11,080
Michael Kennedy: can just turn these tools on it and like

460
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:13,380
Michael Kennedy: you know

461
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:15,120
Michael Kennedy: love it or hate it that is a

462
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:17,460
Michael Kennedy: skill and a power and a tool

463
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:19,980
Michael Kennedy: that is unlike things we've had before

464
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:24,160
Michael Kennedy: when I started having some of those kinds of experiences, I'm like, all right, I need to pay

465
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:31,620
Michael Kennedy: attention to this. I honestly think a lot of these AIs and LLMs, they're kind of copyright theft

466
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:36,600
Michael Kennedy: and other types of things. And there's the environmental aspect and all that. But these,

467
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:43,360
Michael Kennedy: you know, the thing is out of the box, you know, Pandora is on the loose, right? So given that

468
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:48,160
Michael Kennedy: you're putting their head in the sand, it's not going to make it go away. Should you use it or

469
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:54,080
Michael Kennedy: not like it's it's a very powerful tool and so that is what i'm excited about but i'm not excited

470
00:27:54,220 --> 00:27:59,840
Michael Kennedy: about when i go to youtube and i see a video and i just you can just tell that it's a voiceover plus

471
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:05,020
Michael Kennedy: some general or i go to read a blog and you can tell that it's like they didn't even put enough

472
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:09,620
Michael Kennedy: energy into like they spent less time writing than i have to read it that's not right there's

473
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:14,260
Christopher Trudeau: something going wrong here well as with all tools we'll figure out what works and what doesn't work

474
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:22,420
Christopher Trudeau: Those 8,000 files that you're talking about, though, those are 8,000 files you have and built over time.

475
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:26,240
Michael Kennedy: Lines, by the way, not files.

476
00:28:27,070 --> 00:28:29,840
Michael Kennedy: I think it's a couple hundred files, probably.

477
00:28:31,340 --> 00:28:35,600
Christopher Trudeau: So that might be something that folks listening aren't really aware of, right?

478
00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:43,400
Christopher Trudeau: Like, you're not just the podcasts and the courses, but you're the guy behind the engineering behind all of it.

479
00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:55,760
Christopher Trudeau: So why, you know, why do that? Why not, you know, Squarespace or something along those lines didn't exist when you came out, but you get the idea. Like what, what, why spin it up yourself? How did you, how did you get there?

480
00:28:57,240 --> 00:29:05,700
Michael Kennedy: So it's a good question. When I started, there were places I could have gone and hosted the podcast.

481
00:29:07,610 --> 00:29:15,160
Michael Kennedy: You know, they were very unappealing, not in the sense, like as a consumer of it, like they put your show there.

482
00:29:15,190 --> 00:29:22,020
Michael Kennedy: And then they, they were really ugly and they would do things like next to your show.

483
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:25,440
Michael Kennedy: Here's some other shows you might like. You're like, no, no, I don't.

484
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:27,640
Michael Kennedy: I just got people to come to my page.

485
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:28,460
Michael Kennedy: They just sent them away.

486
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:29,420
Michael Kennedy: Like, don't do that.

487
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:32,560
Michael Kennedy: Right, but those sites are like Squarespace or whatever,

488
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:35,000
Michael Kennedy: and they're hosting a bunch of them,

489
00:29:35,020 --> 00:29:38,100
Michael Kennedy: and so they want engagement on their platform broadly.

490
00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:39,620
Michael Kennedy: They're not for you.

491
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:45,700
Michael Kennedy: So initially I thought, well, plus I don't have a ton of experience writing Python code,

492
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:48,680
Michael Kennedy: and if I'm going to do the podcast, the more I can get my hands on this stuff

493
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:49,780
Michael Kennedy: and get experience.

494
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:55,880
Michael Kennedy: So I just sat down, and really in like three days I wrote the Talk Python website

495
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:58,400
Michael Kennedy: I'm like I'm doing it this weekend

496
00:29:58,660 --> 00:30:00,700
Michael Kennedy: I had a job at the time so I'm like I gotta do it

497
00:30:00,820 --> 00:30:02,000
Michael Kennedy: it's a long weekend we're doing it

498
00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:04,520
Michael Kennedy: and so I just sat there and

499
00:30:05,260 --> 00:30:06,640
Michael Kennedy: cranked it out and really

500
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:08,560
Michael Kennedy: got a

501
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:10,680
Michael Kennedy: really good appreciation for building

502
00:30:12,020 --> 00:30:12,660
Michael Kennedy: all the way

503
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:14,600
Michael Kennedy: to the end you know like not 60%

504
00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:16,660
Michael Kennedy: or following a demo but like no here's a

505
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:18,700
Michael Kennedy: fully working app and all

506
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:20,440
Michael Kennedy: the little nuances but then

507
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:22,400
Michael Kennedy: honestly that's like the

508
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,260
Michael Kennedy: the genesis of the

509
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:30,920
Michael Kennedy: the story that is the book is, well, now how do I get it out there? I built it. It works great here

510
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:36,760
Michael Kennedy: locally. Now, where do I take it? Right? And a lot of places said, well, you just fire up your

511
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:41,240
Michael Kennedy: Linux terminal and your SSH. And I'm like, these words are making me very nervous. I need them to

512
00:30:41,270 --> 00:30:47,580
Christopher Trudeau: not do, I need you to stop saying that. You know, don't forget to swing the chicken over your head.

513
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:58,140
Michael Kennedy: Exactly. So I actually started in Python Anywhere, even before Anaconda owned them, which was

514
00:30:59,780 --> 00:31:11,280
Michael Kennedy: the selling point was you go to your browser. I think you give it a get URL, or maybe you go into

515
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:15,400
Michael Kennedy: a terminally do a get. I can't remember how it worked 10 years ago. But it was basically you go

516
00:31:15,420 --> 00:31:21,400
Michael Kennedy: to the web page, you type in your domain, you get a terminal which is basically an SSH connection,

517
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:25,660
Michael Kennedy: but in the terminal, and then you give it some commands, and then they manage it for you.

518
00:31:26,860 --> 00:31:30,280
Michael Kennedy: And I'm like, okay, I don't really have to know any Linux. I just have to do the two things it

519
00:31:30,420 --> 00:31:37,120
Michael Kennedy: says in the terminal. And then they keep it running, and they do the SSH key, the SSH certificates,

520
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:42,880
Michael Kennedy: the DNS, all that. I'm like, I can do this. And I got it going there, and I was really proud,

521
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:49,600
Michael Kennedy: And I ran Talk Python on basically Python Anywhere and SQLite for like six months.

522
00:31:51,020 --> 00:31:51,680
Michael Kennedy: The first six months.

523
00:31:54,860 --> 00:32:01,500
Michael Kennedy: But then it occurred to me that Python Anywhere is not really intended to host production level applications.

524
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:04,820
Michael Kennedy: And it occurred to me when I got an email from them one day.

525
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:07,040
Michael Kennedy: Again, this is pre-Anaconda.

526
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:13,340
Michael Kennedy: And what it said was, we're going to be down for four hours as we do some maintenance.

527
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:23,880
Michael Kennedy: That's not going to be the best look for my podcast, which is just now starting to gain some traction and getting a lot of people talking on social media and saying, there's a new podcast.

528
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:24,640
Michael Kennedy: You should check it out.

529
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:27,920
Michael Kennedy: I'm like, the four hours are not making me psyched.

530
00:32:27,980 --> 00:32:30,280
Michael Kennedy: Like, I understand that things might have to reboot.

531
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:31,860
Michael Kennedy: They might be down for 30 seconds.

532
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:38,380
Michael Kennedy: But hours and hours seems a little like this is not really what they intend this for.

533
00:32:38,580 --> 00:32:40,180
Michael Kennedy: It's like for hobbyists to put up a thing.

534
00:32:41,140 --> 00:32:42,500
Michael Kennedy: And I probably don't belong there anymore.

535
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:48,540
Christopher Trudeau: And once you shifted, why not AWS or Azure or something like that?

536
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:53,600
Michael Kennedy: So I looked around and I went to DigitalOcean.

537
00:32:55,460 --> 00:32:59,160
Michael Kennedy: So I'd done stuff with both Azure and AWS.

538
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:08,740
Michael Kennedy: A little part that I left out about this web journey is I had actually run some pretty big websites in both AWS and Azure,

539
00:33:09,940 --> 00:33:13,660
Michael Kennedy: but they were Windows-based.NET type things, right?

540
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:20,540
Michael Kennedy: So literally GUI sort of configuration hosting them or platform as a service.

541
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:23,320
Michael Kennedy: And I don't know.

542
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:26,460
Michael Kennedy: I looked at both of them, especially Azure at the time.

543
00:33:26,460 --> 00:33:29,260
Michael Kennedy: I'm like, well, this is complicated and unnecessarily so.

544
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:34,700
Michael Kennedy: and I'm afraid I'm trading one level of complexity for another

545
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:38,600
Michael Kennedy: and also really expensive, like no joke expensive.

546
00:33:41,780 --> 00:33:45,940
Michael Kennedy: The podcast, like in terms of people viewing the pages,

547
00:33:46,540 --> 00:33:47,480
Michael Kennedy: is nothing insane.

548
00:33:47,690 --> 00:33:49,320
Michael Kennedy: I mean, it's certainly popular,

549
00:33:49,390 --> 00:33:51,260
Michael Kennedy: but it's nothing like how are you going to handle that?

550
00:33:51,310 --> 00:33:53,719
Michael Kennedy: But the amount of traffic the podcasts and courses do

551
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:59,400
Michael Kennedy: in terms of video and MP3s and even XML.

552
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:04,100
Michael Kennedy: I think Talk Python ships about a gigabyte of,

553
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:06,700
Michael Kennedy: no, a terabyte of XML.

554
00:34:07,180 --> 00:34:08,679
Michael Kennedy: Think about a terabyte of XML every month.

555
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:12,360
Michael Kennedy: It's basically a distributed denial, a DDoS,

556
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:14,639
Michael Kennedy: a welcome DDoS attack,

557
00:34:15,260 --> 00:34:17,960
Michael Kennedy: because you'll think how many podcast players are out there going,

558
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:20,300
Michael Kennedy: got a new one, got a new one, got a new one, got a new one.

559
00:34:20,540 --> 00:34:23,240
Michael Kennedy: And each one of those requests is like a meg.

560
00:34:24,420 --> 00:34:25,899
Michael Kennedy: of XML or more.

561
00:34:26,050 --> 00:34:27,860
Michael Kennedy: You know, it's like, got a new one, got a new one, got a new one.

562
00:34:29,060 --> 00:34:29,940
Michael Kennedy: And so

563
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:34,040
Michael Kennedy: originally I was using S3 to ship

564
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:38,100
Michael Kennedy: the podcasts, certainly

565
00:34:38,210 --> 00:34:41,520
Michael Kennedy: the courses, and my bill was well over a thousand bucks in just bandwidth.

566
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:44,960
Michael Kennedy: Right. And then I looked at DigitalOcean and I'm like,

567
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:48,320
Michael Kennedy: oh, you mean

568
00:34:48,419 --> 00:34:51,220
Michael Kennedy: all that bandwidth is free? It's included?

569
00:34:52,399 --> 00:34:58,400
Michael Kennedy: You get like terabytes of free traffic with DigitalOcean or Hetzner or some of these smaller ones.

570
00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:01,560
Michael Kennedy: And I'm just like, yeah, this is better.

571
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:10,280
Michael Kennedy: Like, I don't know what this stuff for is here where they charge, you know, $100 a terabyte just to ship stuff around.

572
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:11,620
Michael Kennedy: It's crazy.

573
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:17,520
Christopher Trudeau: I have found particularly professionally, it's like, oh, you're going to charge me for how many DNS lookups there are.

574
00:35:18,060 --> 00:35:20,480
Christopher Trudeau: That doesn't seem like something I can predict.

575
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:23,100
Christopher Trudeau: Yes, I know.

576
00:35:23,620 --> 00:35:29,560
Christopher Trudeau: And quite frankly, if it reaches a certain level, I need you to turn it off because something's gone horribly awry.

577
00:35:31,380 --> 00:35:34,000
Michael Kennedy: There's certainly areas where the cloud can go sideways.

578
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:38,600
Michael Kennedy: In the book, I mentioned a story about Kara, I believe.

579
00:35:40,660 --> 00:35:47,880
Michael Kennedy: And that was this project that this woman, I think in Hong Kong or South Korea, I'm afraid I can't remember which.

580
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:50,060
Michael Kennedy: I think it's South Korea.

581
00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:52,200
Michael Kennedy: Anyway, created this, she's a photographer

582
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:54,240
Michael Kennedy: and really hates AI generated art.

583
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:55,940
Michael Kennedy: So created this service that would say,

584
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:59,880
Michael Kennedy: hey, give me a piece of art and I'll tell you

585
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:03,460
Michael Kennedy: if it's AI generated or not, or something vaguely like this.

586
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:07,260
Michael Kennedy: And her thing took off in the app store

587
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:08,100
Michael Kennedy: and was like number six.

588
00:36:08,740 --> 00:36:13,440
Michael Kennedy: And her cloud bill at Vercel was $96,000 in a week.

589
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:16,580
Michael Kennedy: As not as a business, just as a human

590
00:36:16,620 --> 00:36:19,260
Michael Kennedy: who built something fun as a side project, like, oh my.

591
00:36:20,260 --> 00:36:25,800
Christopher Trudeau: Yeah. And in fairness to a lot of those tools, they tend to have ways of saying, please limit this and do that.

592
00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:26,540
Christopher Trudeau: Yeah. Yeah.

593
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:37,100
Christopher Trudeau: They're not the default. And if you're not thinking about that problem and protecting yourself, you know, you'd kind of hope that it would be the other way around.

594
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:42,540
Christopher Trudeau: It should be, you know, here's your cap. And if you want more than that, you need to do something about it.

595
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:48,620
Michael Kennedy: so yeah absolutely and to their fairness they did send her a message saying your bill is going way

596
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:53,940
Michael Kennedy: higher than you might expect and like she didn't look at her email or something but but still and

597
00:36:53,940 --> 00:37:02,300
Michael Kennedy: so one of the things that really appeals to me is when you choose something like a hetzner or a

598
00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:06,059
Michael Kennedy: digital ocean or something and you say i'm going to pay for the server you're like okay that's

599
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:08,600
Michael Kennedy: $40 I'm committing to.

600
00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:11,380
Michael Kennedy: Maybe double that, you know, whatever.

601
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:15,700
Michael Kennedy: But the bandwidth is basically free, or it's included, right?

602
00:37:15,820 --> 00:37:17,240
Michael Kennedy: But for $40, it feels free.

603
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:21,920
Michael Kennedy: And then it's only going to cost as much as it costs.

604
00:37:22,020 --> 00:37:24,660
Michael Kennedy: You might have to go, oh, my gosh, it's too much traffic.

605
00:37:24,860 --> 00:37:25,700
Michael Kennedy: We're going to have to deal with it.

606
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:31,080
Michael Kennedy: But the upper bound of those systems these days is so high.

607
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:39,220
Michael Kennedy: It is so high that we, you know, back to that aspirational thing that you mentioned, right?

608
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:50,860
Michael Kennedy: Like the chances that you blow past what a $50 server can handle, you're going to be really, really popular with the SaaS or something.

609
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:53,960
Christopher Trudeau: You were joking earlier about SQLite.

610
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:55,540
Christopher Trudeau: It's gotten so much better as well.

611
00:37:55,580 --> 00:37:57,680
Christopher Trudeau: And I'm not saying it's the answer to everything.

612
00:37:58,540 --> 00:38:02,420
Christopher Trudeau: but I could probably come pretty close to running your site now too.

613
00:38:02,620 --> 00:38:04,680
Christopher Trudeau: Like it's scary between the,

614
00:38:05,140 --> 00:38:08,100
Christopher Trudeau: between the processor improvements and the improvements in the software.

615
00:38:08,340 --> 00:38:11,420
Christopher Trudeau: It's, it's made a big, made a big difference for that kind of stuff.

616
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:15,780
Christopher Trudeau: It takes very, very little hardware to, to, to handle something that's,

617
00:38:15,980 --> 00:38:17,400
Christopher Trudeau: that's pretty, pretty impressive.

618
00:38:18,260 --> 00:38:18,440
Christopher Trudeau: Yeah.

619
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:22,680
Christopher Trudeau: You're so I think the title of chapter four is one of my favorites.

620
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:26,640
Christopher Trudeau: I, it gives a little hint as to what approach you took.

621
00:38:26,780 --> 00:38:28,880
Christopher Trudeau: The title is Docker, Docker, Docker.

622
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:30,800
Christopher Trudeau: So what approach did you take?

623
00:38:31,820 --> 00:38:32,240
Michael Kennedy: You know what?

624
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:33,720
Michael Kennedy: I was really not wanting to do Docker.

625
00:38:34,300 --> 00:38:35,520
Michael Kennedy: Genuinely, I mean that.

626
00:38:35,820 --> 00:38:42,720
Michael Kennedy: And so what I did when I originally switched over to some VMs, I'm like, okay, the story I'm told of what the cloud is.

627
00:38:43,380 --> 00:38:46,020
Michael Kennedy: You know, I bought the EC2 story.

628
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:48,200
Michael Kennedy: Well, we've got all this extra capacity.

629
00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:55,760
Michael Kennedy: Instead of getting like really expensive, heavy metal, you know, big metal sort of servers, you get a bunch of small ones.

630
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:58,420
Michael Kennedy: and they're kind of like cheap and you just make them,

631
00:38:58,570 --> 00:38:59,680
Michael Kennedy: throw them away, whatever, right?

632
00:39:00,020 --> 00:39:03,300
Michael Kennedy: So I went and made a bunch of small servers in DigitalOcean.

633
00:39:03,430 --> 00:39:04,880
Michael Kennedy: I think I had eight servers at one point.

634
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:07,360
Michael Kennedy: And I thought, this is gonna give me lots of isolation.

635
00:39:07,590 --> 00:39:09,820
Michael Kennedy: If I gotta work on this one thing, it won't mess with that.

636
00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:12,640
Michael Kennedy: And then what I realized is they're interconnected enough,

637
00:39:13,260 --> 00:39:18,420
Michael Kennedy: like that really, I ended up just having to reboot eight servers

638
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:20,720
Michael Kennedy: in an orchestrated way than managing.

639
00:39:20,980 --> 00:39:22,100
Michael Kennedy: I'm like, this is just worse.

640
00:39:22,540 --> 00:39:24,560
Michael Kennedy: I gotta patch eight servers instead of one now,

641
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:30,880
Michael Kennedy: because this is not better. So how do I end up with Docker, Docker, Docker? I realized that

642
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:37,080
Michael Kennedy: it would be better to just have one server and basically stepping back just a little bit, like,

643
00:39:37,580 --> 00:39:44,220
Michael Kennedy: what if you could completely isolate yourself from almost all the complexity of the cloud and all of

644
00:39:44,220 --> 00:39:50,439
Michael Kennedy: their services and all that junk and just say, I have a place where I can run apps that's got

645
00:39:50,460 --> 00:39:53,400
Michael Kennedy: enough capacity that I can just keep throwing more apps in there if I want.

646
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:57,740
Michael Kennedy: And it doesn't have any tie in with the specific

647
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:02,740
Michael Kennedy: APIs and services of a particular provider. So I said, well what if I just

648
00:40:02,740 --> 00:40:06,180
Michael Kennedy: get a big server and I just run all my apps in there

649
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:09,840
Michael Kennedy: and if I want a database I put the database there. If I want like a

650
00:40:10,580 --> 00:40:14,200
Michael Kennedy: Valkey caching I can put a Valkey caching and things like that. And

651
00:40:16,300 --> 00:40:20,420
Michael Kennedy: that's sort of as much autonomy as I can exert on running something

652
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:24,360
Michael Kennedy: in the cloud, right? It's almost like I went and got a big machine and stuck it in my closet.

653
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:29,900
Michael Kennedy: But that's insane because you get million dollar networking equipment and, you know, failover.

654
00:40:30,460 --> 00:40:35,940
Michael Kennedy: But that doesn't mean you have to go fully past managed database, this other service. Like you

655
00:40:35,950 --> 00:40:43,119
Michael Kennedy: could just say, just give me a Linux machine where I can then go do my, do my, my hosting and all my

656
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:47,640
Michael Kennedy: apps and let them party and talk to each other and stuff in there, right?

657
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:53,700
Michael Kennedy: So then I thought, well, I don't have all these little servers for isolation.

658
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:58,020
Michael Kennedy: I'm not really sure I want to throw all this random stuff together,

659
00:40:59,380 --> 00:41:03,480
Michael Kennedy: like completely just in the same soup in that one big server.

660
00:41:03,900 --> 00:41:06,300
Michael Kennedy: And by the way, the big server right now that it's running,

661
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:09,280
Michael Kennedy: it has eight cores, 16 gigs of RAM and costs $30.

662
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:10,020
Christopher Trudeau: Right.

663
00:41:11,420 --> 00:41:13,560
Michael Kennedy: It comes with two terabytes of four terabytes traffic,

664
00:41:13,670 --> 00:41:14,080
Michael Kennedy: something like that.

665
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:14,700
Michael Kennedy: Lots.

666
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:18,740
Michael Kennedy: $400 of included bandwidth for $30.

667
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:21,460
Michael Kennedy: So I said, well, what if I took that over?

668
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:26,740
Michael Kennedy: Like autonomy is a big motivator of this whole journey as well.

669
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:30,200
Michael Kennedy: Like I don't want to be tied into all these different things.

670
00:41:30,250 --> 00:41:33,860
Michael Kennedy: I just want a space where I have reliable compute networking

671
00:41:34,300 --> 00:41:35,860
Michael Kennedy: and Linux and I can just do whatever.

672
00:41:36,100 --> 00:41:38,140
Michael Kennedy: So then I said, all right, well,

673
00:41:38,300 --> 00:41:44,080
Michael Kennedy: I better figure out some of the stuff with Docker just so that there's some isolation

674
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:49,760
Michael Kennedy: of all the different pieces living in the same space. So I forced myself to learn Docker. And

675
00:41:49,860 --> 00:41:57,660
Michael Kennedy: what occurred to me was, oh, Docker is just writing down in a file what I would normally

676
00:41:57,760 --> 00:42:03,220
Michael Kennedy: have to type in the terminal to make the thing happen, except for I put run in front of the

677
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:09,280
Michael Kennedy: command or copy instead of CP and I get a repeatability.

678
00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:13,280
Christopher Trudeau: And, and, and someone else has packaged a bunch of this stuff.

679
00:42:13,340 --> 00:42:14,740
Michael Kennedy: So you don't have to do it yourself.

680
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:15,600
Michael Kennedy: Exactly.

681
00:42:15,860 --> 00:42:20,100
Michael Kennedy: And I'm like, okay, I don't know what all my concern was about because it's,

682
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:21,480
Michael Kennedy: it's not much more complicated.

683
00:42:22,060 --> 00:42:24,400
Michael Kennedy: Another one of my concerns was sort of monitorability.

684
00:42:24,580 --> 00:42:28,640
Michael Kennedy: Like if it's all, if I just go there and I just create a bunch of virtual

685
00:42:28,820 --> 00:42:31,900
Michael Kennedy: admittance and run my code, I can actually go and see the source code.

686
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,080
Michael Kennedy: I can see the config files.

687
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:34,940
Michael Kennedy: I can see where the logs are being written.

688
00:42:35,100 --> 00:42:37,800
Michael Kennedy: And I can sort of manage it through SSH.

689
00:42:39,160 --> 00:42:41,440
Michael Kennedy: And I thought, well, if I put a bunch of disconnected Docker

690
00:42:41,620 --> 00:42:43,040
Michael Kennedy: things together, that's going to be challenging.

691
00:42:43,120 --> 00:42:45,600
Michael Kennedy: And I realized, actually, not really.

692
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:48,180
Michael Kennedy: Like if you set it up the same, you could still

693
00:42:48,420 --> 00:42:49,300
Michael Kennedy: tail all the logs.

694
00:42:49,660 --> 00:42:49,860
Michael Kennedy: Yeah.

695
00:42:50,100 --> 00:42:54,260
Michael Kennedy: And you can SSH into the containers

696
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:58,620
Michael Kennedy: if you really have to look at something running inside them.

697
00:42:58,740 --> 00:43:02,080
Michael Kennedy: like what is the process actually,

698
00:43:02,900 --> 00:43:03,600
Michael Kennedy: I don't know, what does it do?

699
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:05,480
Michael Kennedy: How much memory is it using relative to other stuff?

700
00:43:06,060 --> 00:43:09,460
Michael Kennedy: And I also talk about a bunch of tools for monitoring them.

701
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:11,960
Christopher Trudeau: - Yeah, so how has that changed over time?

702
00:43:12,080 --> 00:43:13,860
Christopher Trudeau: Like you started with some fairly bare bones,

703
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:16,700
Christopher Trudeau: you've got some extra tools.

704
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:20,240
Christopher Trudeau: What does that evolution look like?

705
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:27,140
Michael Kennedy: - Well, I used to rely more on whatever the cloud provider,

706
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:32,780
Michael Kennedy: DigitalOcean or Hetzner offered, they always have a metrics section.

707
00:43:32,860 --> 00:43:34,600
Michael Kennedy: So I can go see, well, what's the CPU doing?

708
00:43:36,700 --> 00:43:38,420
Michael Kennedy: What's the memory looking like over time?

709
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:41,840
Michael Kennedy: And that works OK.

710
00:43:42,440 --> 00:43:46,180
Michael Kennedy: And if you've got one app that you're running there, you're like, OK, well, that must be

711
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:47,540
Michael Kennedy: how much memory the app is using.

712
00:43:48,260 --> 00:43:54,100
Michael Kennedy: But right now, if I go to Talk Python and I ask, I think there are 27 different containers

713
00:43:54,380 --> 00:43:54,460
Michael Kennedy: running.

714
00:43:55,120 --> 00:43:55,480
Christopher Trudeau: OK.

715
00:43:56,280 --> 00:43:59,720
Michael Kennedy: Which you can't ask, how's the server doing?

716
00:43:59,880 --> 00:44:00,500
Michael Kennedy: I know very much.

717
00:44:00,820 --> 00:44:02,320
Michael Kennedy: It really matters much more.

718
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:03,520
Michael Kennedy: Well, it's busy.

719
00:44:03,560 --> 00:44:03,940
Michael Kennedy: I get it.

720
00:44:03,940 --> 00:44:05,340
Michael Kennedy: But which one is the problem?

721
00:44:05,580 --> 00:44:06,360
Michael Kennedy: Which one is busy?

722
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:07,240
Michael Kennedy: Which one's using all of them?

723
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:09,740
Michael Kennedy: So I started to look around.

724
00:44:10,820 --> 00:44:14,140
Michael Kennedy: And there's actually a bunch of recommendations that I have for the book.

725
00:44:14,840 --> 00:44:19,240
Michael Kennedy: So one of them, the first one I used was this thing called Glances.

726
00:44:19,560 --> 00:44:20,760
Michael Kennedy: And Glances is excellent.

727
00:44:21,020 --> 00:44:33,180
Michael Kennedy: And by the way, Glances, the way they talk about often getting it, I think, somewhere they talk about installing it here probably, is often like apt install Glances or something like that, right?

728
00:44:33,940 --> 00:44:36,680
Michael Kennedy: But a lot of these tools even have Docker versions.

729
00:44:37,840 --> 00:44:41,840
Michael Kennedy: If you share the volumes and sockets just right, they function just the same.

730
00:44:42,100 --> 00:44:52,020
Michael Kennedy: So you can say Docker run glances XYZ, and it doesn't even install, it doesn't even touch your one big server that is kind of like your building space.

731
00:44:52,150 --> 00:44:53,740
Michael Kennedy: So it leaves it a little more pure, right?

732
00:44:55,080 --> 00:44:56,240
Michael Kennedy: So glances is super cool.

733
00:44:56,270 --> 00:45:08,560
Michael Kennedy: And what it does is it, if I open it up, is it gives you this really nice dashboard of what's going on with your app, like your server.

734
00:45:08,610 --> 00:45:09,680
Michael Kennedy: How much memory is being used?

735
00:45:09,990 --> 00:45:11,280
Michael Kennedy: How much CPU is being used?

736
00:45:11,420 --> 00:45:12,480
Michael Kennedy: How has that been over time?

737
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:14,660
Michael Kennedy: Has there been extended spikes?

738
00:45:15,780 --> 00:45:16,320
Michael Kennedy: And so on.

739
00:45:16,440 --> 00:45:19,260
Michael Kennedy: And one of the things that's new to Glances,

740
00:45:19,420 --> 00:45:22,040
Michael Kennedy: and I don't think it's in this picture that's on their home screen.

741
00:45:22,260 --> 00:45:23,600
Michael Kennedy: I'm pretty sure it is not.

742
00:45:23,780 --> 00:45:24,220
Michael Kennedy: Oh, no, it is.

743
00:45:25,120 --> 00:45:26,820
Michael Kennedy: Mine is inverted because I have so many.

744
00:45:27,260 --> 00:45:28,680
Michael Kennedy: It has a container section.

745
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,840
Michael Kennedy: So when you run it, it actually shows you not just the processes,

746
00:45:32,620 --> 00:45:36,320
Michael Kennedy: but also gives you a performance, memory, I.O., etc.

747
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:39,020
Michael Kennedy: for all the running containers and their uptimes

748
00:45:39,260 --> 00:45:40,100
Michael Kennedy: and those kind of things.

749
00:45:41,620 --> 00:45:43,100
Michael Kennedy: so this is super cool

750
00:45:43,690 --> 00:45:45,560
Michael Kennedy: so you construct a certain docker command

751
00:45:45,830 --> 00:45:47,240
Michael Kennedy: and then you have this running dashboard

752
00:45:48,760 --> 00:45:49,100
Michael Kennedy: that just

753
00:45:49,900 --> 00:45:51,620
Michael Kennedy: goes so this is the first thing

754
00:45:51,660 --> 00:45:52,840
Michael Kennedy: that I started with and I really like that

755
00:45:53,580 --> 00:45:55,460
Michael Kennedy: but then I also found something called

756
00:45:55,880 --> 00:45:57,280
Michael Kennedy: btop are you familiar with btop

757
00:45:57,600 --> 00:45:58,580
Christopher Trudeau: no I haven't used this one

758
00:45:58,690 --> 00:46:01,320
Michael Kennedy: oh my gosh btop is incredible this is so good

759
00:46:01,940 --> 00:46:02,380
Michael Kennedy: it's

760
00:46:03,640 --> 00:46:04,520
Michael Kennedy: really something

761
00:46:06,860 --> 00:46:07,600
Michael Kennedy: zoom in on it

762
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:09,119
Michael Kennedy: so this gives you

763
00:46:09,780 --> 00:46:13,840
Michael Kennedy: like moving graphs over time of all sorts of things.

764
00:46:14,660 --> 00:46:18,720
Michael Kennedy: It shows you like graphs of network, inbound, outbound traffic.

765
00:46:18,840 --> 00:46:20,460
Michael Kennedy: It shows you the CPUs.

766
00:46:20,460 --> 00:46:21,600
Michael Kennedy: It gives you a breakdown of like,

767
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:23,540
Michael Kennedy: here's all the different distributed work

768
00:46:23,720 --> 00:46:26,260
Michael Kennedy: across your eight CPU cores and over total.

769
00:46:28,180 --> 00:46:29,540
Michael Kennedy: It's really something else.

770
00:46:29,640 --> 00:46:31,320
Michael Kennedy: And so this one is really nice.

771
00:46:31,320 --> 00:46:34,580
Michael Kennedy: You can configure the UI a lot to show

772
00:46:34,780 --> 00:46:37,880
Michael Kennedy: and zoom in on disk activity or whatever.

773
00:46:39,080 --> 00:46:40,360
Michael Kennedy: This is really a nice way to view it.

774
00:46:40,360 --> 00:46:43,720
Michael Kennedy: And again, when you run all these Docker containers,

775
00:46:43,840 --> 00:46:46,720
Michael Kennedy: they feel like they're super isolated and tucked away.

776
00:46:47,900 --> 00:46:49,280
Michael Kennedy: And from their perspective, they are.

777
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:51,520
Michael Kennedy: But when you look in the process list here,

778
00:46:52,580 --> 00:46:54,720
Michael Kennedy: it just shows the process that Docker is running.

779
00:46:55,620 --> 00:46:58,120
Michael Kennedy: So I have all my web apps and APIs and stuff

780
00:46:58,400 --> 00:46:59,620
Michael Kennedy: setting a process name.

781
00:47:00,120 --> 00:47:02,340
Michael Kennedy: So instead of just Python, Python, Python, Python, Python,

782
00:47:03,020 --> 00:47:05,840
Michael Kennedy: it'll say like, talk Python, gradient worker one,

783
00:47:06,120 --> 00:47:07,440
Michael Kennedy: talk Python, gradient worker two.

784
00:47:10,120 --> 00:47:14,340
Michael Kennedy: courses indexing service daemon and then when you look into any of these tools

785
00:47:15,860 --> 00:47:20,740
Michael Kennedy: you can see oh exactly what is busy and those are actually the names inside of docker but they still

786
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:27,560
Michael Kennedy: surface exactly like that to all these tools one of the things you said kind of hit home for me

787
00:47:27,700 --> 00:47:33,380
Christopher Trudeau: it was subtle and it kind of moved on which was like if you interconnect it correctly right like

788
00:47:33,360 --> 00:47:37,040
Christopher Trudeau: If you get the files and sockets going, this goes smoothly.

789
00:47:38,080 --> 00:47:40,660
Christopher Trudeau: And I think it's one of the things you've done very, very well in the book

790
00:47:40,760 --> 00:47:42,040
Christopher Trudeau: is sort of walking through that.

791
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:44,880
Christopher Trudeau: Like as you talk about the different Docker configurations, like, okay,

792
00:47:45,320 --> 00:47:48,260
Christopher Trudeau: well, this is why we're putting this here rather than in the container.

793
00:47:48,360 --> 00:47:49,380
Christopher Trudeau: This is going to be shared.

794
00:47:49,980 --> 00:47:54,960
Christopher Trudeau: And the reason for this, I assume some of that was experimental.

795
00:47:55,400 --> 00:47:58,560
Christopher Trudeau: You just sort of over time, you kind of went, oh, okay, wait,

796
00:47:58,680 --> 00:47:59,880
Christopher Trudeau: I need that somewhere else.

797
00:48:00,580 --> 00:48:07,180
Christopher Trudeau: Or was there somebody's knowledge that you depended on a lot there?

798
00:48:07,420 --> 00:48:08,260
Christopher Trudeau: How did you get there?

799
00:48:08,820 --> 00:48:10,120
Christopher Trudeau: How organic is the journey?

800
00:48:12,460 --> 00:48:13,760
Michael Kennedy: I would say half and half.

801
00:48:14,080 --> 00:48:16,980
Michael Kennedy: Like some of it, for example, the Glances stuff.

802
00:48:18,320 --> 00:48:24,020
Michael Kennedy: I just found when I went looking for it that there was like ways to install.

803
00:48:24,120 --> 00:48:27,540
Michael Kennedy: And I said, it just said, oh, you could just install it by running this Docker thing.

804
00:48:27,660 --> 00:48:29,100
Michael Kennedy: And it's like a big, long command.

805
00:48:30,060 --> 00:48:31,700
Michael Kennedy: I'm like, oh, that's cool.

806
00:48:32,130 --> 00:48:34,320
Michael Kennedy: Because it doesn't matter how long the command is.

807
00:48:34,610 --> 00:48:40,220
Michael Kennedy: What I would do is I'll go into my.zshrc and say alias, glances, equals, paste.

808
00:48:40,640 --> 00:48:42,420
Michael Kennedy: And then I save that somewhere.

809
00:48:42,470 --> 00:48:45,200
Michael Kennedy: And I never, I couldn't tell you what it is at all.

810
00:48:45,270 --> 00:48:47,740
Michael Kennedy: I just know it has to like do a, yeah, it has a few things.

811
00:48:47,810 --> 00:48:51,940
Michael Kennedy: So it can like look back into the host to see, you know, what's running and so on.

812
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,140
Michael Kennedy: Yeah, so a lot of it was like that.

813
00:48:56,240 --> 00:49:02,820
Michael Kennedy: And then some of it was definitely, you know, two whole days of like, why won't that talk to that?

814
00:49:03,250 --> 00:49:04,000
Michael Kennedy: Let me build it again.

815
00:49:04,290 --> 00:49:05,260
Michael Kennedy: Let me do some more to vote.

816
00:49:05,380 --> 00:49:05,820
Michael Kennedy: You know what I mean?

817
00:49:05,900 --> 00:49:06,800
Michael Kennedy: And eventually like, okay.

818
00:49:07,380 --> 00:49:07,520
Michael Kennedy: All right.

819
00:49:07,580 --> 00:49:12,240
Michael Kennedy: But once you get it kind of dialed, then it's, once you get a little bit of it working, it's a blueprint.

820
00:49:12,350 --> 00:49:14,200
Michael Kennedy: You just like, again, again, again.

821
00:49:15,320 --> 00:49:19,440
Christopher Trudeau: So you seem to have taken a bit of a, like a heavier weight approach here.

822
00:49:19,660 --> 00:49:23,880
Christopher Trudeau: You're, it's, it's everything in the kitchen sink.

823
00:49:24,060 --> 00:49:25,880
Christopher Trudeau: That implies that it's not the right amount.

824
00:49:26,140 --> 00:49:29,180
Christopher Trudeau: but it's counter to some of the advice that's out there.

825
00:49:29,860 --> 00:49:32,180
Christopher Trudeau: Sometimes folks talk about wanting to have things

826
00:49:32,420 --> 00:49:33,460
Christopher Trudeau: as minimal as possible.

827
00:49:35,460 --> 00:49:37,760
Christopher Trudeau: Why what you've done versus the other,

828
00:49:38,260 --> 00:49:39,520
Christopher Trudeau: how are they wrong?

829
00:49:40,140 --> 00:49:41,740
Christopher Trudeau: Can we start a flame war on the internet?

830
00:49:42,280 --> 00:49:42,840
Michael Kennedy: - Let's do it.

831
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:45,280
Michael Kennedy: Let's see how many, Michael, you're wrong,

832
00:49:45,290 --> 00:49:46,640
Michael Kennedy: I can get into the YouTube comments.

833
00:49:46,890 --> 00:49:48,140
Michael Kennedy: Actually, please, that's not a challenge.

834
00:49:51,060 --> 00:49:52,240
Michael Kennedy: So here's the deal.

835
00:49:55,300 --> 00:50:07,200
Michael Kennedy: I want, especially at the beginning of this journey, when I was like, I want as much comfort and visibility as I can get in these containers and other areas.

836
00:50:07,300 --> 00:50:07,780
Michael Kennedy: You know what I mean?

837
00:50:08,420 --> 00:50:16,080
Michael Kennedy: And I wanted to make it as close to if I just set up a VM and just, you know, uv, V, E, and V, and just roll from there.

838
00:50:16,260 --> 00:50:16,380
Michael Kennedy: Right.

839
00:50:18,340 --> 00:50:24,400
Michael Kennedy: So what I did is I said, okay, I could try to go for like the super slim Docker image.

840
00:50:25,620 --> 00:50:31,080
Michael Kennedy: or I could just get like a basic Docker image, but then put, you know, I put like,

841
00:50:31,240 --> 00:50:36,720
Michael Kennedy: oh, my Z shell and ZSH on it, right? Does that need it? No, you could use SH,

842
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:42,260
Michael Kennedy: but do you know what happens when you use SH and you go in there? It's a brand new start. It

843
00:50:42,460 --> 00:50:46,880
Michael Kennedy: doesn't remember anything you've ever, any command you've ever run. It doesn't give you any help.

844
00:50:47,880 --> 00:50:51,300
Michael Kennedy: You know, you hit tab, it doesn't tell you nothing, right? You're like, oh gosh,

845
00:50:52,120 --> 00:50:57,940
Michael Kennedy: But if you use like, oh, my Z shell, it'll show you, hey, what version of Python is your virtual environment activated in?

846
00:50:58,380 --> 00:51:02,260
Michael Kennedy: And I can just hit command R and filter all my history.

847
00:51:03,039 --> 00:51:10,040
Michael Kennedy: And I can hit get tab and it'll autocomplete all the get commands that I forgot what I was supposed to use because I'm freaked out because the site is down.

848
00:51:10,070 --> 00:51:10,880
Michael Kennedy: And how do I fix this?

849
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:13,460
Michael Kennedy: I mean, I wouldn't actually be in the container for that.

850
00:51:13,640 --> 00:51:19,900
Michael Kennedy: But a lot of times you're in there kind of exploring because you're like, it's been fine for six months, but I need to see something.

851
00:51:20,920 --> 00:51:24,460
Michael Kennedy: And so in the book, at least in the beginning,

852
00:51:24,640 --> 00:51:28,000
Michael Kennedy: I recommended to people that they install some of these tools

853
00:51:28,140 --> 00:51:30,000
Michael Kennedy: that you might install into your own terminal

854
00:51:30,140 --> 00:51:31,280
Michael Kennedy: to make you feel more comfortable.

855
00:51:32,500 --> 00:51:36,440
Michael Kennedy: So that my assumption is you're kind of new to Docker.

856
00:51:37,340 --> 00:51:38,480
Michael Kennedy: You're feeling a little uncomfortable.

857
00:51:39,300 --> 00:51:43,180
Michael Kennedy: Like, who cares if it's another 100 megs on your hard drive?

858
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:47,800
Michael Kennedy: You're not shipping your app to Docker Hub.

859
00:51:48,520 --> 00:51:50,940
Michael Kennedy: You're not going to take your web app, probably.

860
00:51:52,300 --> 00:51:54,100
Michael Kennedy: It's not a reusable component.

861
00:51:54,560 --> 00:51:56,000
Michael Kennedy: You've got your source code, and you

862
00:51:56,220 --> 00:51:58,080
Michael Kennedy: want the thing to just run here.

863
00:51:58,900 --> 00:51:59,900
Michael Kennedy: You're not shipping it.

864
00:51:59,960 --> 00:52:03,700
Michael Kennedy: So whoever wants to run indeed.com can just Docker pull that.

865
00:52:04,680 --> 00:52:05,580
Michael Kennedy: That's not what it is.

866
00:52:06,420 --> 00:52:11,160
Michael Kennedy: And in that context, you're not so worried about the space.

867
00:52:11,400 --> 00:52:12,780
Michael Kennedy: And there's a couple of tips that you

868
00:52:12,900 --> 00:52:14,940
Michael Kennedy: can use for really, really fast build times.

869
00:52:16,140 --> 00:52:20,600
Michael Kennedy: So I mean, like container build times for me are like seconds,

870
00:52:20,940 --> 00:52:24,080
Michael Kennedy: a few seconds, even though, you know,

871
00:52:24,160 --> 00:52:29,240
Michael Kennedy: there's 250 pip install packages for Talk Python training,

872
00:52:30,240 --> 00:52:31,700
Michael Kennedy: you know, build times, a couple of,

873
00:52:31,880 --> 00:52:34,540
Michael Kennedy: and that's build time is also installing Python, right?

874
00:52:34,640 --> 00:52:37,580
Michael Kennedy: Like it's, you could make these things fast.

875
00:52:37,620 --> 00:52:39,800
Michael Kennedy: So it's not like a huge impedance,

876
00:52:40,740 --> 00:52:42,440
Michael Kennedy: but I think for people who are new to it,

877
00:52:42,680 --> 00:52:45,680
Michael Kennedy: having a something other than just SH,

878
00:52:45,820 --> 00:52:48,020
Michael Kennedy: not even bash, you're a lot better off.

879
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:49,360
Michael Kennedy: So that's what I promoted.

880
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:50,900
Christopher Trudeau: - And I think it's, you know,

881
00:52:51,060 --> 00:52:52,600
Christopher Trudeau: it kind of comes back to sort of the thesis

882
00:52:52,760 --> 00:52:53,800
Christopher Trudeau: of the book as well, right?

883
00:52:53,900 --> 00:52:55,280
Christopher Trudeau: Which is right for you.

884
00:52:56,320 --> 00:52:58,720
Christopher Trudeau: So, you know, if you are going to be running

885
00:52:59,120 --> 00:53:01,320
Christopher Trudeau: a thousand of these spread across a whole bunch

886
00:53:01,400 --> 00:53:04,080
Christopher Trudeau: of different cores, then yeah, if you optimize this,

887
00:53:04,300 --> 00:53:06,460
Christopher Trudeau: that might change your cost framework and everything else.

888
00:53:07,080 --> 00:53:07,840
Christopher Trudeau: Well, you know.

889
00:53:07,900 --> 00:53:10,340
Michael Kennedy: - Or if I was, sorry, go ahead.

890
00:53:10,460 --> 00:53:13,400
Christopher Trudeau: - If you're 27 on eight CPUs works fine,

891
00:53:13,940 --> 00:53:15,940
Christopher Trudeau: And go for it.

892
00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:18,280
Christopher Trudeau: Why get in your own way?

893
00:53:18,900 --> 00:53:20,640
Michael Kennedy: And that advice is not--

894
00:53:20,760 --> 00:53:23,700
Michael Kennedy: this is why I really emphasize the context sort of thing.

895
00:53:24,420 --> 00:53:26,440
Michael Kennedy: This advice is bad if your goal is

896
00:53:26,560 --> 00:53:30,220
Michael Kennedy: to ship a container to Docker Hub so that people can self-host

897
00:53:30,280 --> 00:53:31,300
Michael Kennedy: your open source thing.

898
00:53:31,820 --> 00:53:34,640
Michael Kennedy: You don't want that to have extra crap that they don't need.

899
00:53:34,980 --> 00:53:37,600
Michael Kennedy: But when there's only one of them for your machine,

900
00:53:38,020 --> 00:53:40,700
Michael Kennedy: and you're building it, and you're managing it,

901
00:53:41,600 --> 00:53:43,760
Michael Kennedy: make it as comfy and helpful as possible.

902
00:53:44,780 --> 00:53:45,460
Michael Kennedy: That was my philosophy.

903
00:53:46,340 --> 00:53:52,100
Christopher Trudeau: The, the structure of your site is,  it has a lot of different pieces to it

904
00:53:52,460 --> 00:53:54,120
Christopher Trudeau: using different technology.

905
00:53:55,100 --> 00:53:58,900
Christopher Trudeau: you spend some time talking about like static sites and using static sites

906
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:03,000
Christopher Trudeau: for part of it versus, you know, Python applications and those kinds of parts.

907
00:54:03,680 --> 00:54:06,840
Christopher Trudeau: the, how did you end up here?

908
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:09,700
Christopher Trudeau: Like oftentimes the answer when you're looking at this kind of stuff as well,

909
00:54:10,160 --> 00:54:11,300
Christopher Trudeau: I need a CMS for everything.

910
00:54:11,450 --> 00:54:16,320
Christopher Trudeau: And then I will try to figure out how to square peg my round hole of a CMS or

911
00:54:16,490 --> 00:54:19,180
Christopher Trudeau: whatever. So how did you end up with a collection?

912
00:54:20,339 --> 00:54:24,600
Michael Kennedy: Well, you know, like many things that start simple and then you're like,

913
00:54:24,700 --> 00:54:25,640
Michael Kennedy: well, I just one more thing.

914
00:54:27,740 --> 00:54:28,620
Michael Kennedy: So I tried,

915
00:54:28,770 --> 00:54:32,260
Michael Kennedy: I had kept pretty much the same web framework across all my different sites

916
00:54:32,560 --> 00:54:36,260
Michael Kennedy: thinking, okay, that's, I'm going to just pick one and go with it.

917
00:54:36,260 --> 00:54:38,040
Michael Kennedy: I think a lot of people do that. You know, there's people who are like,

918
00:54:38,200 --> 00:54:40,420
Michael Kennedy: I use Django, there's people I use Flask and so on.

919
00:54:41,020 --> 00:54:44,460
Michael Kennedy: And then just slowly over time,

920
00:54:44,600 --> 00:54:48,100
Michael Kennedy: you're like really this part is really a hassle.

921
00:54:48,540 --> 00:54:50,960
Michael Kennedy: I'd be a lot better off if I made that part

922
00:54:51,820 --> 00:54:55,420
Michael Kennedy: served through the CDN or why am I,

923
00:54:55,760 --> 00:54:58,220
Michael Kennedy: you know, one of the things that I see a lot

924
00:54:58,380 --> 00:55:00,700
Michael Kennedy: and it doesn't drive me crazy,

925
00:55:00,820 --> 00:55:02,940
Michael Kennedy: but I'm just like, yeah, it's probably not necessary

926
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:06,880
Michael Kennedy: is a lot of people in technology X,

927
00:55:07,080 --> 00:55:07,920
Michael Kennedy: For us, that's Python.

928
00:55:08,160 --> 00:55:09,680
Michael Kennedy: It could be JavaScript.

929
00:55:09,980 --> 00:55:11,400
Michael Kennedy: It could be.NET, whatever, right?

930
00:55:12,180 --> 00:55:14,080
Michael Kennedy: People who work extensively in that

931
00:55:14,120 --> 00:55:15,960
Michael Kennedy: and have a lot of their identity tied into that,

932
00:55:16,120 --> 00:55:16,900
Michael Kennedy: like I do and others.

933
00:55:18,300 --> 00:55:20,260
Michael Kennedy: Like, I'm a Python developer, right?

934
00:55:20,460 --> 00:55:22,680
Michael Kennedy: So if I'm going to choose a tool,

935
00:55:22,860 --> 00:55:26,000
Michael Kennedy: like let's say a CMS or a static site generator

936
00:55:26,040 --> 00:55:26,700
Michael Kennedy: or something like that,

937
00:55:26,880 --> 00:55:28,040
Michael Kennedy: I'm going to choose the Python one

938
00:55:29,020 --> 00:55:30,000
Michael Kennedy: because I'm a Python person.

939
00:55:30,180 --> 00:55:33,140
Michael Kennedy: Like, okay, but are there better options out there

940
00:55:33,180 --> 00:55:35,140
Michael Kennedy: than the Python ones for what you're trying to do?

941
00:55:35,300 --> 00:55:37,280
Michael Kennedy: Because are you going to extend this tool?

942
00:55:37,630 --> 00:55:37,720
Michael Kennedy: No.

943
00:55:37,910 --> 00:55:39,420
Michael Kennedy: Then what do you care what it's written in?

944
00:55:39,580 --> 00:55:41,620
Michael Kennedy: Your operating system is not written in Python.

945
00:55:42,300 --> 00:55:44,740
Michael Kennedy: It's written in C or--

946
00:55:44,740 --> 00:55:46,460
Christopher Trudeau: Well, I'm not going to use this word processor,

947
00:55:46,650 --> 00:55:47,920
Christopher Trudeau: because it's not written in Python.

948
00:55:48,599 --> 00:55:48,960
Michael Kennedy: Exactly.

949
00:55:49,460 --> 00:55:51,380
Michael Kennedy: Just have to go back in, no, I need a new service.

950
00:55:52,200 --> 00:55:52,840
Michael Kennedy: You don't see it.

951
00:55:52,940 --> 00:55:53,720
Michael Kennedy: You don't have to work with it.

952
00:55:53,750 --> 00:55:54,320
Michael Kennedy: You don't care.

953
00:55:55,220 --> 00:55:58,220
Michael Kennedy: And so I ended up a little bit with a mishmash of just trying

954
00:55:58,230 --> 00:55:59,540
Michael Kennedy: to say, what are the best tools?

955
00:55:59,840 --> 00:56:03,140
Michael Kennedy: For example, for the blog and some of the other static elements,

956
00:56:03,680 --> 00:56:05,160
Michael Kennedy: I use Hugo, which is written in Go.

957
00:56:07,080 --> 00:56:10,400
Michael Kennedy: It's like, OK, I type the command Hugo,

958
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:12,480
Michael Kennedy: and it does its thing.

959
00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:13,820
Michael Kennedy: I don't really care what it's written in.

960
00:56:14,340 --> 00:56:15,960
Michael Kennedy: The templating extension is a little bit annoying.

961
00:56:19,240 --> 00:56:21,600
Michael Kennedy: But I kind of just went around and said, OK,

962
00:56:21,650 --> 00:56:25,580
Michael Kennedy: well, what do I think would be the best fit to make my life easy,

963
00:56:25,800 --> 00:56:29,940
Michael Kennedy: not to reinforce my identity as this type of developer

964
00:56:30,010 --> 00:56:31,000
Michael Kennedy: or that type of developer?

965
00:56:32,720 --> 00:56:43,660
Christopher Trudeau: Yeah, it's the one of the things, you know, I'll show my own stripes here and you can defend your beloved flask if you like.

966
00:56:43,710 --> 00:56:51,740
Christopher Trudeau: But having come from the Django side, some of the things that you kind of learned organically here are forced on you in Django.

967
00:56:53,000 --> 00:57:02,580
Christopher Trudeau: So when you, like the instructions for putting together a production site are, and you will run this command and it will move all of your static content over here.

968
00:57:03,060 --> 00:57:09,160
Christopher Trudeau: So like your mental model when you come from that side is, oh, my site is actually built of these, at least these two different things.

969
00:57:10,100 --> 00:57:15,780
Christopher Trudeau: And I think coming from Flask, you might have sort of, that discovery might have been a little more organic.

970
00:57:17,420 --> 00:57:19,200
Christopher Trudeau: You might not have been forced into it immediately.

971
00:57:19,480 --> 00:57:27,300
Christopher Trudeau: But once you've come to that realization of, oh, wait, I have these pieces and I can use something like Nginx to tie it all together.

972
00:57:27,500 --> 00:57:32,400
Christopher Trudeau: that means, well, then I don't have to figure out how to use a CMS for this thing that's very

973
00:57:32,600 --> 00:57:38,420
Christopher Trudeau: unnatural for a CMS. I can just mount it under slash blog and it'll work fine. Yeah.

974
00:57:39,080 --> 00:57:44,340
Michael Kennedy: Yeah. Jingo is very powerful. It definitely is. And I actually talked a lot about that in the

975
00:57:44,820 --> 00:57:51,020
Michael Kennedy: book, like evaluating web frameworks. But I would say before we, if we're going to that,

976
00:57:51,020 --> 00:57:55,300
Michael Kennedy: but before we do, I think your point about using Nginx to piece things together,

977
00:57:56,720 --> 00:57:59,080
Michael Kennedy: or Caddy or traffic or whatever, it doesn't matter,

978
00:57:59,290 --> 00:58:00,460
Michael Kennedy: like some front-end web server.

979
00:58:00,510 --> 00:58:01,120
Michael Kennedy: They all do it.

980
00:58:01,660 --> 00:58:01,760
Michael Kennedy: Yeah.

981
00:58:03,380 --> 00:58:06,560
Michael Kennedy: So often people think I have this Python app.

982
00:58:06,660 --> 00:58:07,860
Michael Kennedy: Let's say I have a Django app.

983
00:58:08,240 --> 00:58:09,720
Michael Kennedy: So I want to add a CMS to it.

984
00:58:09,940 --> 00:58:11,220
Michael Kennedy: What could I possibly add?

985
00:58:12,140 --> 00:58:13,080
Michael Kennedy: Is it static content?

986
00:58:13,960 --> 00:58:15,580
Michael Kennedy: Well, maybe what you should add is Hugo.

987
00:58:16,010 --> 00:58:16,400
Michael Kennedy: I don't know.

988
00:58:16,400 --> 00:58:17,300
Michael Kennedy: I'm just making this up, right?

989
00:58:17,360 --> 00:58:18,520
Michael Kennedy: It might actually be a bad option.

990
00:58:19,720 --> 00:58:21,000
Michael Kennedy: Well, Hugo is not a Python thing.

991
00:58:21,030 --> 00:58:22,700
Michael Kennedy: So how do I put it into my Django app?

992
00:58:23,220 --> 00:58:25,200
Michael Kennedy: I mean, they're very, very different in the way they work.

993
00:58:25,320 --> 00:58:26,920
Michael Kennedy: So they don't really go that super well together.

994
00:58:27,500 --> 00:58:29,960
Michael Kennedy: If you were to try to think, how does one literally,

995
00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:31,780
Michael Kennedy: source code wise, go into another?

996
00:58:32,360 --> 00:58:37,020
Michael Kennedy: But if you just made a Hugo site or other static site,

997
00:58:37,100 --> 00:58:40,140
Michael Kennedy: however you make it, and then put it on the same server,

998
00:58:41,260 --> 00:58:44,100
Michael Kennedy: and then in Nginx when you say, if you go to this domain slash

999
00:58:45,100 --> 00:58:47,960
Michael Kennedy: docs, it goes completely over here.

1000
00:58:48,100 --> 00:58:50,320
Michael Kennedy: And if it goes anywhere else, it goes just to Django.

1001
00:58:51,120 --> 00:58:52,420
Michael Kennedy: And all of a sudden, from the outside,

1002
00:58:52,840 --> 00:58:56,060
Michael Kennedy: It looks like a very cohesive single thing

1003
00:58:56,240 --> 00:58:57,360
Michael Kennedy: with just different sub URLs.

1004
00:58:58,460 --> 00:59:00,920
Michael Kennedy: But you get to choose the best technology for the static bits,

1005
00:59:01,140 --> 00:59:04,060
Michael Kennedy: and you get to choose the best technology for your dynamic data

1006
00:59:04,220 --> 00:59:04,540
Michael Kennedy: driven bits.

1007
00:59:05,300 --> 00:59:08,960
Michael Kennedy: And that is all just done by configuring the front end web

1008
00:59:09,180 --> 00:59:12,120
Michael Kennedy: server that you don't even have visibility to in Python.

1009
00:59:12,240 --> 00:59:14,100
Michael Kennedy: And I think that that's a big mental shift.

1010
00:59:14,140 --> 00:59:15,760
Michael Kennedy: But it's like those kinds of things

1011
00:59:16,660 --> 00:59:20,059
Michael Kennedy: that bring both the flexibility to make these choices

1012
00:59:20,080 --> 00:59:22,160
Michael Kennedy: and the simplicity to not try to jam them together.

1013
00:59:24,160 --> 00:59:26,860
Christopher Trudeau: - There's a third party library for Django

1014
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:28,860
Christopher Trudeau: that I use once in a while, which is called Distill.

1015
00:59:29,700 --> 00:59:33,000
Christopher Trudeau: And it's a static site generator based on Django.

1016
00:59:33,780 --> 00:59:35,900
Christopher Trudeau: So say you had your URL was like books,

1017
00:59:36,340 --> 00:59:39,260
Christopher Trudeau: you know, it's books/1, book/2, book/3.

1018
00:59:39,420 --> 00:59:41,760
Christopher Trudeau: Well, you tell Distill, I want book

1019
00:59:42,040 --> 00:59:44,200
Christopher Trudeau: and I want all the possible queries of this number

1020
00:59:44,840 --> 00:59:47,840
Christopher Trudeau: and it will generate the results as static.

1021
00:59:48,580 --> 00:59:51,020
Christopher Trudeau: So even when you've got a dynamic site,

1022
00:59:51,070 --> 00:59:53,840
Christopher Trudeau: you can actually carve off the static portion

1023
00:59:54,090 --> 00:59:56,380
Christopher Trudeau: and then have that fed straight out of NGINX.

1024
00:59:56,830 --> 00:59:59,140
Christopher Trudeau: And if it isn't, if there's no actual dynamic content

1025
00:59:59,520 --> 01:00:01,680
Christopher Trudeau: on the page, and if it only updates when the database

1026
01:00:01,930 --> 01:00:03,020
Christopher Trudeau: updates or something like that,

1027
01:00:03,280 --> 01:00:06,080
Christopher Trudeau: and you can do it nightly, like this gives you all sorts

1028
01:00:06,080 --> 01:00:08,820
Christopher Trudeau: of other options and you know, to come back to your,

1029
01:00:09,140 --> 01:00:10,840
Christopher Trudeau: my eight processor, whatever's well,

1030
01:00:12,120 --> 01:00:13,920
Christopher Trudeau: the static sites are almost free.

1031
01:00:14,340 --> 01:00:15,500
Michael Kennedy: - You do not even need that.

1032
01:00:15,650 --> 01:00:16,440
Christopher Trudeau: You don't even need it.

1033
01:00:16,600 --> 01:00:17,360
Christopher Trudeau: - It's nothing.

1034
01:00:17,680 --> 01:00:21,640
Christopher Trudeau: So you can scale way down and have an absolutely mammoth site

1035
01:00:21,980 --> 01:00:25,220
Christopher Trudeau: just by properly fine-tuning what's dynamic and what's static.

1036
01:00:25,680 --> 01:00:28,620
Michael Kennedy: Yeah, you could go to millions and millions of requests

1037
01:00:28,710 --> 01:00:34,540
Michael Kennedy: if you just converted all that stuff to static

1038
01:00:34,650 --> 01:00:41,700
Michael Kennedy: and then put the extra resources, CSS, image, JavaScript, etc., on a CDN.

1039
01:00:42,380 --> 01:00:46,480
Michael Kennedy: I mean, that's like web on easy mode right there

1040
01:00:46,440 --> 01:00:52,000
Michael Kennedy: because it can't go down unless the server literally.

1041
01:00:52,070 --> 01:00:53,320
Michael Kennedy: Almost, almost can't go down.

1042
01:00:53,320 --> 01:00:55,320
Michael Kennedy: Yeah, I mean, let's not say we're in the eve of,

1043
01:00:55,510 --> 01:00:57,640
Michael Kennedy: like, are we in the eve of a fifth going down?

1044
01:00:58,420 --> 01:01:02,140
Michael Kennedy: But, I mean, it can't go down because the code is wrong

1045
01:01:02,430 --> 01:01:04,400
Michael Kennedy: or there's a race condition or you're out of memory.

1046
01:01:04,610 --> 01:01:10,680
Michael Kennedy: Like, it's really close to just, if the web server is up

1047
01:01:12,880 --> 01:01:14,160
Michael Kennedy: and you put a CD in front of it

1048
01:01:14,260 --> 01:01:15,700
Michael Kennedy: and then it's not even necessarily that.

1049
01:01:15,900 --> 01:01:17,860
Michael Kennedy: It's like the CDN has to go.

1050
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:19,700
Michael Kennedy: You've got to have a Cloudflare level incident.

1051
01:01:19,780 --> 01:01:23,620
Christopher Trudeau: Yeah, and fully distributed in often cases, right?

1052
01:01:23,640 --> 01:01:28,120
Christopher Trudeau: So people in continents other than where you are based

1053
01:01:28,340 --> 01:01:30,660
Christopher Trudeau: are getting fantastic load times

1054
01:01:31,080 --> 01:01:32,940
Christopher Trudeau: because it's cached locally for them.

1055
01:01:33,720 --> 01:01:35,140
Michael Kennedy: Yeah, I just want to give a little shout out.

1056
01:01:35,380 --> 01:01:38,080
Michael Kennedy: I'm going to give a little shout out to Bunny.net.

1057
01:01:38,820 --> 01:01:40,720
Michael Kennedy: I know people are all about Cloudflare,

1058
01:01:40,880 --> 01:01:43,459
Michael Kennedy: but this is a cool European company

1059
01:01:43,940 --> 01:01:46,760
Michael Kennedy: that focuses on privacy, has some really nice features.

1060
01:01:47,100 --> 01:01:47,700
Michael Kennedy: The pricing is great.

1061
01:01:47,810 --> 01:01:51,780
Michael Kennedy: And they have, if you go here, go to the CDN,

1062
01:01:52,480 --> 01:01:55,220
Michael Kennedy: they've got somewhere way down here,

1063
01:01:55,490 --> 01:02:00,260
Michael Kennedy: like 119 different places, including all over Africa.

1064
01:02:02,980 --> 01:02:06,480
Michael Kennedy: And this is just super, super cheap for traffic.

1065
01:02:07,320 --> 01:02:07,860
Christopher Trudeau: Nice.

1066
01:02:08,680 --> 01:02:08,780
Christopher Trudeau: Yeah.

1067
01:02:08,880 --> 01:02:13,440
Christopher Trudeau: So earlier there, I wasn't intending

1068
01:02:13,500 --> 01:02:17,960
Christopher Trudeau: to to force a fist fight and you know we're on the opposite side of the continent so that would

1069
01:02:17,960 --> 01:02:25,460
Christopher Trudeau: be a challenge uh when i django versus flash go uh but uh you know i think one of my favorite

1070
01:02:25,700 --> 01:02:31,120
Christopher Trudeau: chapters was actually chapter 13 which was titled picking a python web framework uh i really liked

1071
01:02:31,360 --> 01:02:39,200
Christopher Trudeau: the new nuance of this uh it's it's unusual for folks to sort of reveal their reasoning and

1072
01:02:39,940 --> 01:02:50,120
Christopher Trudeau: Honestly, I think like because I had no intention of tomorrow going and using Docker, the Docker chapters were interesting because I like to see how other people do things.

1073
01:02:50,820 --> 01:02:57,340
Christopher Trudeau: But like I could grab the picking a Python web framework, pull that chapter out and hand it to almost any of my students.

1074
01:02:57,560 --> 01:02:57,680
Christopher Trudeau: Right.

1075
01:02:57,840 --> 01:03:01,440
Christopher Trudeau: Like it's this, you know, how do I make these kinds of decisions?

1076
01:03:01,580 --> 01:03:02,360
Christopher Trudeau: How is this different?

1077
01:03:02,540 --> 01:03:03,700
Christopher Trudeau: Why do I think about these things?

1078
01:03:04,300 --> 01:03:07,780
Christopher Trudeau: And so often the content on this is really just religious war.

1079
01:03:08,820 --> 01:03:15,800
Christopher Trudeau: And you've done like a really, really good job there of just sort of conveying this, you know, hey, here are pros and cons for each.

1080
01:03:15,860 --> 01:03:17,520
Christopher Trudeau: And this is why I picked this.

1081
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:22,140
Christopher Trudeau: And so I really, really liked how you covered that.

1082
01:03:22,760 --> 01:03:23,200
Christopher Trudeau: Thank you so much.

1083
01:03:23,680 --> 01:03:31,100
Christopher Trudeau: What you, I guess it's maybe the answer is obvious, but why?

1084
01:03:31,660 --> 01:03:33,020
Christopher Trudeau: Like you were fine.

1085
01:03:33,080 --> 01:03:37,320
Christopher Trudeau: You were just doing configuration file after configuration file and then a little bit editorial.

1086
01:03:38,080 --> 01:03:41,680
Christopher Trudeau: What caused you, what was the emphasis for,

1087
01:03:42,020 --> 01:03:44,120
Christopher Trudeau: the impetus for spicing it up a little?

1088
01:03:45,040 --> 01:03:49,460
Michael Kennedy: - Well, I mean, I think it's an important part

1089
01:03:49,460 --> 01:03:54,780
Michael Kennedy: of the journey is picking a technology to run your code on.

1090
01:03:54,920 --> 01:03:56,500
Michael Kennedy: So there's actually a couple of places

1091
01:03:56,740 --> 01:03:57,460
Michael Kennedy: that I kind of have that.

1092
01:03:57,600 --> 01:04:00,360
Michael Kennedy: Like I have that for, I'm trying to create a term here

1093
01:04:00,360 --> 01:04:01,560
Michael Kennedy: 'cause I don't think we do a good job

1094
01:04:01,640 --> 01:04:06,820
Michael Kennedy: of disambiguating it from like Nginx of Python,

1095
01:04:07,320 --> 01:04:10,020
Michael Kennedy: like production app servers, like where your code runs.

1096
01:04:10,240 --> 01:04:11,780
Michael Kennedy: I think there's a little more disambiguation.

1097
01:04:11,920 --> 01:04:15,440
Michael Kennedy: I'm talking like Granian, G-Unicorn, those kinds of things.

1098
01:04:18,780 --> 01:04:22,000
Michael Kennedy: Hypercorn, Uveacorn now, all those places you run your Python code.

1099
01:04:22,640 --> 01:04:27,340
Michael Kennedy: So I kind of went through a debate on those from Michael's context, right?

1100
01:04:27,840 --> 01:04:29,880
Michael Kennedy: And then I did the same for Python web frameworks.

1101
01:04:30,240 --> 01:04:34,600
Michael Kennedy: And it was, you know, I told the story of the bootstrap

1102
01:04:34,620 --> 01:04:36,920
Michael Kennedy: and how I just every time I have to write new code,

1103
01:04:37,020 --> 01:04:38,140
Michael Kennedy: I'm like, here we go.

1104
01:04:39,060 --> 01:04:41,920
Michael Kennedy: I'm in the relic and write in the relic code.

1105
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:44,420
Michael Kennedy: I kind of felt the same way.

1106
01:04:45,340 --> 01:04:46,680
Michael Kennedy: So everything was based on Pyramid.

1107
01:04:46,720 --> 01:04:49,580
Michael Kennedy: And I loved Pyramid and I still have a lot of respect for it.

1108
01:04:49,640 --> 01:04:51,340
Michael Kennedy: The reason I chose Pyramid in 2015

1109
01:04:52,320 --> 01:04:54,880
Michael Kennedy: was when I went to the Flask page,

1110
01:04:55,560 --> 01:05:00,620
Michael Kennedy: it said, you may potentially be able to use Python 3,

1111
01:05:00,860 --> 01:05:03,060
Michael Kennedy: but we are not supporting it and we don't recommend it.

1112
01:05:03,780 --> 01:05:07,380
Michael Kennedy: And I'm like, wait a minute, didn't Python 3 come out in 2008?

1113
01:05:08,320 --> 01:05:09,640
Michael Kennedy: That's like seven years later.

1114
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:10,560
Michael Kennedy: You know what?

1115
01:05:11,660 --> 01:05:13,040
Michael Kennedy: No, I'm not doing that.

1116
01:05:14,280 --> 01:05:17,440
Michael Kennedy: I'm starting this project beyond this problem,

1117
01:05:17,700 --> 01:05:20,740
Michael Kennedy: and I'm not going back to be in the, you know what I mean?

1118
01:05:21,280 --> 01:05:23,620
Michael Kennedy: They've since obviously moved on from that.

1119
01:05:24,760 --> 01:05:25,880
Michael Kennedy: So Flask was out.

1120
01:05:26,300 --> 01:05:29,220
Michael Kennedy: I looked at Django, and I thought, I'm really like a microservice guy.

1121
01:05:29,400 --> 01:05:30,500
Michael Kennedy: I really want to use Mongo.

1122
01:05:32,100 --> 01:05:34,020
Michael Kennedy: A lot of things were not quite good fits.

1123
01:05:34,160 --> 01:05:35,620
Michael Kennedy: They actually would be better fits now, right?

1124
01:05:35,840 --> 01:05:36,420
Michael Kennedy: Even then.

1125
01:05:36,740 --> 01:05:37,080
Michael Kennedy: Yeah, no.

1126
01:05:37,240 --> 01:05:41,180
Christopher Trudeau: If you want to do Mongo, that's almost a deal breaker.

1127
01:05:41,680 --> 01:05:42,240
Michael Kennedy: Yeah, I know.

1128
01:05:42,420 --> 01:05:42,540
Michael Kennedy: Almost.

1129
01:05:42,860 --> 01:05:44,920
Michael Kennedy: And so I'm like, all right, well, maybe not Django.

1130
01:05:45,260 --> 01:05:46,900
Michael Kennedy: Well, you had a pyramid.

1131
01:05:47,300 --> 01:05:51,900
Michael Kennedy: They're like, we are trying to embrace the latest standards.

1132
01:05:52,360 --> 01:05:54,480
Michael Kennedy: We're Python 3 first, et cetera, et cetera.

1133
01:05:55,260 --> 01:05:57,640
Michael Kennedy: And I'm like, all right, I'm going to give this a chance,

1134
01:05:57,840 --> 01:05:58,860
Michael Kennedy: even though it wasn't as popular.

1135
01:05:59,000 --> 01:05:59,500
Michael Kennedy: Like, this is great.

1136
01:05:59,620 --> 01:06:03,340
Michael Kennedy: And I used it for eight years, seven years, something like that.

1137
01:06:03,380 --> 01:06:03,900
Michael Kennedy: It was really good.

1138
01:06:07,060 --> 01:06:09,240
Michael Kennedy: But things evolved over time, right?

1139
01:06:09,300 --> 01:06:10,760
Michael Kennedy: Like Pydantic came out.

1140
01:06:10,760 --> 01:06:12,160
Michael Kennedy: And Pydantic was great.

1141
01:06:13,560 --> 01:06:16,860
Michael Kennedy: What's a really nice way to talk to the database with Pydantic?

1142
01:06:17,540 --> 01:06:17,840
Michael Kennedy: Beanie.

1143
01:06:18,500 --> 01:06:18,700
Michael Kennedy: Okay.

1144
01:06:19,600 --> 01:06:21,720
Michael Kennedy: So I can do Beanie and I can do Pydantic.

1145
01:06:21,800 --> 01:06:25,200
Michael Kennedy: And wow, what a really nice, clever way to write databases.

1146
01:06:26,080 --> 01:06:28,580
Michael Kennedy: And oh, Beanie is all async only.

1147
01:06:29,900 --> 01:06:36,380
Michael Kennedy: pyramids synchronous only when was the last commit to pyramid oh it was two and a half years ago

1148
01:06:36,840 --> 01:06:41,020
Michael Kennedy: chances that it gets async support are low because that was just like a minor bug fix you know what

1149
01:06:41,020 --> 01:06:45,760
Michael Kennedy: i mean it's just like it's fine open source projects they ebb and they flow and they come

1150
01:06:45,760 --> 01:06:53,660
Michael Kennedy: and they go but i'm just like i should really i should really move this forward to something

1151
01:06:54,400 --> 01:06:57,980
Michael Kennedy: that feels like it's active right i mean stuff in the web makes me nervous i'm always

1152
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:00,340
Michael Kennedy: Did you put a port open on the internet?

1153
01:07:00,600 --> 01:07:02,360
Michael Kennedy: Well, that's scary.

1154
01:07:03,760 --> 01:07:11,560
Michael Kennedy: And so a framework that felt like things were not on top of it as it could have been made me nervous.

1155
01:07:12,080 --> 01:07:17,600
Michael Kennedy: To be fair, I don't know that they had any security incidents or very, very few because it did so little.

1156
01:07:17,860 --> 01:07:23,600
Michael Kennedy: It's not like it had a bunch of admin pages or something where there's like accepting input.

1157
01:07:24,140 --> 01:07:26,260
Michael Kennedy: But still, same reason.

1158
01:07:26,420 --> 01:07:33,760
Michael Kennedy: So I'm like, I really want to use these more modern tools, typing, async, pydantic, et

1159
01:07:33,780 --> 01:07:33,960
Michael Kennedy: cetera.

1160
01:07:34,900 --> 01:07:39,140
Michael Kennedy: And I kind of would not like to continue building on something that feels like it's no longer

1161
01:07:39,520 --> 01:07:40,020
Michael Kennedy: being supported.

1162
01:07:41,900 --> 01:07:47,540
Christopher Trudeau: And similarly, you, with Chapter 13, sort of that, you know, the different thought process

1163
01:07:47,800 --> 01:07:52,580
Christopher Trudeau: there, you also provide Chapter 15, which is a retrospective on Hetzner, which is the

1164
01:07:52,620 --> 01:07:54,120
Christopher Trudeau: hosting provider that you chose.

1165
01:07:55,920 --> 01:07:59,340
Christopher Trudeau: And again, I think it's pretty clear.

1166
01:07:59,580 --> 01:08:00,900
Christopher Trudeau: I think I've said it three different ways.

1167
01:08:01,400 --> 01:08:04,000
Christopher Trudeau: My favorite stuff in the book really is sort of this, you know,

1168
01:08:04,140 --> 01:08:08,540
Christopher Trudeau: that the little insight into Michael's brain, right?

1169
01:08:08,680 --> 01:08:12,420
Christopher Trudeau: Like how did he make this decision and how happy is he with these decisions, right?

1170
01:08:12,900 --> 01:08:18,080
Christopher Trudeau: I think that's the stuff that's globally applicable to a reader, which is nice.

1171
01:08:18,759 --> 01:08:22,080
Christopher Trudeau: So it's now even a few months further on with Hetzner.

1172
01:08:22,380 --> 01:08:24,180
Christopher Trudeau: So you still happy?

1173
01:08:24,520 --> 01:08:25,359
Christopher Trudeau: Any regrets yet?

1174
01:08:26,060 --> 01:08:32,640
Michael Kennedy: yeah no no regrets it hasn't been absolutely 100% smooth let's see that's

1175
01:08:32,640 --> 01:08:37,940
Michael Kennedy: I could tell you how long it's been if I can get past all the ads there we go so

1176
01:08:38,200 --> 01:08:46,779
Michael Kennedy: I actually blogged about this and yeah so it's been about a year I guess no

1177
01:08:46,880 --> 01:08:53,620
Michael Kennedy: regrets I would say if people are out there looking around to me it really and

1178
01:08:53,640 --> 01:08:58,540
Michael Kennedy: And you want to follow the philosophy of Michael, like carve yourself a space out in a multimillion

1179
01:08:58,660 --> 01:09:01,020
Michael Kennedy: dollar data center that doesn't have anything to do with it.

1180
01:09:01,240 --> 01:09:03,580
Michael Kennedy: And you just run your code in your own space.

1181
01:09:05,100 --> 01:09:07,859
Michael Kennedy: DigitalOcean and Hetzner are the two ones.

1182
01:09:08,040 --> 01:09:09,299
Michael Kennedy: And I did DigitalOcean for a long time.

1183
01:09:09,480 --> 01:09:16,359
Michael Kennedy: When Hetzner came out, I thought they just had some really interesting appeal.

1184
01:09:16,700 --> 01:09:18,480
Michael Kennedy: I started seeing a lot of people talking about them.

1185
01:09:19,839 --> 01:09:23,200
Michael Kennedy: They are a German company and they were just in Europe.

1186
01:09:23,580 --> 01:09:25,440
Michael Kennedy: And I'm like, I love Europe,

1187
01:09:26,100 --> 01:09:27,940
Michael Kennedy: but the majority of my customers are in the US.

1188
01:09:28,259 --> 01:09:31,140
Michael Kennedy: So what is the best place for my server?

1189
01:09:31,620 --> 01:09:33,460
Michael Kennedy: Probably the East coast of the United States,

1190
01:09:33,580 --> 01:09:35,580
Michael Kennedy: 'cause that serves the US really well,

1191
01:09:35,620 --> 01:09:37,759
Michael Kennedy: but then it's like one hop across the ocean

1192
01:09:37,819 --> 01:09:39,640
Michael Kennedy: to all of Europe as well.

1193
01:09:39,740 --> 01:09:43,900
Michael Kennedy: So it's still really fast from there and so on.

1194
01:09:44,240 --> 01:09:48,400
Michael Kennedy: So I didn't want to move my server to Europe,

1195
01:09:50,359 --> 01:09:53,400
Michael Kennedy: when I felt like being closer to the U.S. was more important.

1196
01:09:53,540 --> 01:09:54,940
Michael Kennedy: Not so much because I needed to manage it.

1197
01:09:54,940 --> 01:09:58,440
Michael Kennedy: I could SSH to wherever, but, you know, just East Coast to the U.S.

1198
01:09:58,490 --> 01:10:02,200
Michael Kennedy: And then they're like, hey, we have two new U.S. data centers,

1199
01:10:02,580 --> 01:10:09,200
Michael Kennedy: one near Virginia right by the U.S. East One, the infamous AWS U.S. East One.

1200
01:10:09,860 --> 01:10:14,060
Michael Kennedy: And the other one actually in Hillsborough, Oregon, just down the street from me.

1201
01:10:14,360 --> 01:10:14,860
Michael Kennedy: Oh, okay.

1202
01:10:14,860 --> 01:10:15,120
Michael Kennedy: Which is funny.

1203
01:10:15,250 --> 01:10:17,780
Michael Kennedy: Yeah, it's like I could drive to it in like 20 minutes.

1204
01:10:19,680 --> 01:10:21,960
Michael Kennedy: which of all places in the world is relatively close.

1205
01:10:22,710 --> 01:10:24,100
Michael Kennedy: So I went and looked at it and I said,

1206
01:10:24,230 --> 01:10:25,440
Michael Kennedy: let me just check it out.

1207
01:10:25,620 --> 01:10:27,840
Michael Kennedy: And the prices are super cheap.

1208
01:10:27,850 --> 01:10:30,120
Michael Kennedy: You get a little bit less support

1209
01:10:30,580 --> 01:10:35,200
Michael Kennedy: and I think a little bit less top tier data center

1210
01:10:35,440 --> 01:10:36,000
Michael Kennedy: than DigitalOcean.

1211
01:10:36,570 --> 01:10:39,140
Michael Kennedy: But the prices are like insane there.

1212
01:10:40,080 --> 01:10:45,380
Michael Kennedy: Like I said, eight core server for 30 bucks.

1213
01:10:45,940 --> 01:10:47,000
Michael Kennedy: You know, that's insane.

1214
01:10:47,780 --> 01:10:52,260
Michael Kennedy: And when I first signed up, that came with 20 terabytes of free traffic.

1215
01:10:52,980 --> 01:10:53,180
Christopher Trudeau: Wow.

1216
01:10:54,600 --> 01:11:00,400
Michael Kennedy: Which is about $1,700 out of AWS.

1217
01:11:01,220 --> 01:11:01,360
Christopher Trudeau: Right.

1218
01:11:01,640 --> 01:11:03,140
Michael Kennedy: Included in your $30 bill.

1219
01:11:03,440 --> 01:11:03,920
Michael Kennedy: You know what I mean?

1220
01:11:04,060 --> 01:11:05,300
Michael Kennedy: Like, oh, my gosh.

1221
01:11:05,860 --> 01:11:06,000
Christopher Trudeau: Yeah.

1222
01:11:06,620 --> 01:11:08,660
Michael Kennedy: So, yeah, I talk a lot about it in the book.

1223
01:11:08,840 --> 01:11:11,340
Michael Kennedy: But, yeah, I went over and moved my stuff over there.

1224
01:11:11,400 --> 01:11:13,660
Michael Kennedy: And it's been good.

1225
01:11:13,780 --> 01:11:18,000
Michael Kennedy: I've had one incident where the machine that it was on died.

1226
01:11:18,940 --> 01:11:21,040
Michael Kennedy: The one big server, wherever it was, it died.

1227
01:11:22,100 --> 01:11:25,360
Michael Kennedy: And they had to move it, which blows my mind.

1228
01:11:26,160 --> 01:11:29,080
Michael Kennedy: They were able to hot relocate it to another server.

1229
01:11:29,560 --> 01:11:34,380
Michael Kennedy: But the problem is it has a 300 gig external drive,

1230
01:11:35,780 --> 01:11:37,260
Michael Kennedy: and that didn't move location.

1231
01:11:37,460 --> 01:11:41,180
Michael Kennedy: So all of a sudden, a lot of the IO operations were much slower

1232
01:11:41,400 --> 01:11:43,060
Michael Kennedy: because they weren't close to the server anymore.

1233
01:11:44,220 --> 01:11:48,120
Michael Kennedy: why why did my docker builds take two minutes they used to take about three or four seconds

1234
01:11:48,200 --> 01:11:52,700
Michael Kennedy: i cannot figure it out and i i wrote him they're like no there's we've tested there's no problem

1235
01:11:52,820 --> 01:11:57,280
Michael Kennedy: like i don't care what you say there's a huge problem and eventually there's like we moved it

1236
01:11:57,320 --> 01:12:04,000
Michael Kennedy: again it's fine and then it was fine but right so you know if if folks are looking for something

1237
01:12:04,820 --> 01:12:09,860
Christopher Trudeau: slightly lighter weight and this is going to sound like a commercial i'm just a happy customer i don't

1238
01:12:09,880 --> 01:12:16,740
Christopher Trudeau: no sponsorship or whatever but i use opal stack with a lot of my clients um what do you use opal

1239
01:12:16,920 --> 01:12:23,320
Christopher Trudeau: stack opal stack yeah and you wouldn't go full docker with it um but they do act they do give

1240
01:12:23,320 --> 01:12:29,740
Christopher Trudeau: you access full ssh ssh to the box and they've got a neat little sort of packaging thing they don't

1241
01:12:29,980 --> 01:12:34,400
Christopher Trudeau: support a lot of things but if you've got like django or flask or you know static files for

1242
01:12:34,420 --> 01:12:40,460
Christopher Trudeau: nginx or whatever you hit a couple buttons in the dashboard and it spawns it up but a lot of tools

1243
01:12:40,620 --> 01:12:44,440
Christopher Trudeau: like that it spawns it up and then you're not allowed to touch it what they do is create all

1244
01:12:44,440 --> 01:12:48,700
Christopher Trudeau: the entries in the directories and then you can ssh into the box and get at the files themselves so i

1245
01:12:48,820 --> 01:12:54,820
Christopher Trudeau: find it's a nice little compromise between the two uh it would not scale to what you're doing

1246
01:12:55,420 --> 01:13:00,320
Christopher Trudeau: but if folks are looking for a relatively inexpensive thing to experiment with i find

1247
01:13:00,340 --> 01:13:01,600
Christopher Trudeau: it's a nice little stopgap.

1248
01:13:02,200 --> 01:13:03,100
Michael Kennedy: Yeah, that's awesome.

1249
01:13:03,460 --> 01:13:06,600
Michael Kennedy: I'm always interested in finding those types of things.

1250
01:13:08,060 --> 01:13:08,900
Michael Kennedy: This one is new to me.

1251
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:09,380
Michael Kennedy: This is cool.

1252
01:13:10,620 --> 01:13:13,520
Christopher Trudeau: Yeah, this is, I'm trying to remember,

1253
01:13:14,400 --> 01:13:16,900
Christopher Trudeau: there was a site I used to use, it got bought.

1254
01:13:18,480 --> 01:13:20,280
Christopher Trudeau: The half of the founders went,

1255
01:13:20,530 --> 01:13:21,440
Christopher Trudeau: we don't want to be bought,

1256
01:13:21,880 --> 01:13:24,080
Christopher Trudeau: and took their baseball bat and created Opal Stack.

1257
01:13:24,270 --> 01:13:26,320
Christopher Trudeau: So I used to be a client of the original

1258
01:13:26,470 --> 01:13:27,500
Christopher Trudeau: and mulling them along.

1259
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:28,460
Christopher Trudeau: So, yeah.

1260
01:13:28,780 --> 01:13:28,940
Christopher Trudeau: Cool.

1261
01:13:29,180 --> 01:13:31,780
Christopher Trudeau: And very happy with the service as well.

1262
01:13:32,100 --> 01:13:35,140
Christopher Trudeau: They're like, you open a ticket and things are very human,

1263
01:13:35,440 --> 01:13:37,060
Christopher Trudeau: which is nice in this day and age.

1264
01:13:37,900 --> 01:13:39,800
Christopher Trudeau: I'm usually expecting to talk to a bot.

1265
01:13:40,640 --> 01:13:42,480
Michael Kennedy: You're getting about as much support as you get out of Gmail.

1266
01:13:42,880 --> 01:13:43,320
Christopher Trudeau: Yeah, exactly.

1267
01:13:44,060 --> 01:13:45,800
Michael Kennedy: Or Google Docs, which is done.

1268
01:13:46,720 --> 01:13:50,600
Michael Kennedy: Another thing worth a shout out here is sort of an alternate way

1269
01:13:50,800 --> 01:13:53,280
Michael Kennedy: of working with Docker and Docker Compose directly

1270
01:13:53,360 --> 01:13:56,480
Michael Kennedy: that I propose in the book is something called Coolify.

1271
01:13:56,600 --> 01:13:57,620
Michael Kennedy: Are you familiar with Coolify?

1272
01:13:58,200 --> 01:13:59,060
Christopher Trudeau: No, this one I don't know.

1273
01:13:59,540 --> 01:14:00,780
Michael Kennedy: Yeah, this is super interesting.

1274
01:14:00,990 --> 01:14:06,520
Michael Kennedy: So what this does is it knows how to run Docker, Docker Compose,

1275
01:14:07,400 --> 01:14:12,040
Michael Kennedy: but it also gives you all sorts of easier ways.

1276
01:14:12,270 --> 01:14:15,580
Michael Kennedy: So if people look at what I'm proposing, they're like, no, Michael, too complicated.

1277
01:14:16,260 --> 01:14:19,460
Michael Kennedy: This is interesting because what it gives you is it basically gives you

1278
01:14:19,650 --> 01:14:24,240
Michael Kennedy: your own private Heroku or Netlify or Vercel or Railway,

1279
01:14:25,020 --> 01:14:27,620
Michael Kennedy: or you can go in, I don't know how to find it from here.

1280
01:14:28,960 --> 01:14:32,900
Michael Kennedy: But you can also go in and say, let me find any self-hosted app.

1281
01:14:34,020 --> 01:14:34,380
Christopher Trudeau: Okay.

1282
01:14:34,580 --> 01:14:36,020
Michael Kennedy: And they've got hundreds of them in there.

1283
01:14:36,050 --> 01:14:37,460
Michael Kennedy: And then you just type in the name and say,

1284
01:14:38,020 --> 01:14:42,720
Michael Kennedy: install this set of Docker containers as a Docker Compose file into my server.

1285
01:14:43,400 --> 01:14:47,960
Michael Kennedy: So you could create the one big server, which is your own space in someone's cloud.

1286
01:14:49,380 --> 01:14:52,800
Michael Kennedy: And then you can install this or you can pay them five bucks a month

1287
01:14:52,810 --> 01:14:56,500
Michael Kennedy: and they'll actually manage the server, manage the deployments,

1288
01:14:59,679 --> 01:15:03,220
Michael Kennedy: to rollouts of new versions of your app and stuff like that.

1289
01:15:03,580 --> 01:15:07,780
Michael Kennedy: It sounds like it makes it way easier.

1290
01:15:08,320 --> 01:15:12,020
Michael Kennedy: It actually makes it-- it's like two steps forward,

1291
01:15:12,340 --> 01:15:13,500
Michael Kennedy: 1.8 steps backwards.

1292
01:15:15,100 --> 01:15:17,680
Michael Kennedy: Because instead of just using.env files,

1293
01:15:17,700 --> 01:15:21,440
Michael Kennedy: you've got a UI to enter a bunch of environment variables.

1294
01:15:21,940 --> 01:15:24,240
Michael Kennedy: And the saving of them is weird.

1295
01:15:24,260 --> 01:15:26,820
Michael Kennedy: And you're like, oh, I forgot to press save on these three,

1296
01:15:27,060 --> 01:15:28,100
Michael Kennedy: even though I saved the page.

1297
01:15:28,210 --> 01:15:28,840
Michael Kennedy: I mean, there's just...

1298
01:15:28,840 --> 01:15:29,480
Christopher Trudeau: Right, right.

1299
01:15:31,160 --> 01:15:34,340
Michael Kennedy: It promises more ease than you would think,

1300
01:15:34,490 --> 01:15:35,620
Michael Kennedy: and I'm not necessarily switching.

1301
01:15:35,700 --> 01:15:36,980
Michael Kennedy: I do, like, I've played with it some.

1302
01:15:38,120 --> 01:15:41,220
Michael Kennedy: I'm not saying I would switch to it given a choice,

1303
01:15:41,720 --> 01:15:44,680
Michael Kennedy: but it does ease you in.

1304
01:15:44,780 --> 01:15:45,960
Michael Kennedy: It's a little bit like Python Anywhere.

1305
01:15:46,440 --> 01:15:47,640
Michael Kennedy: I'm sure when I started,

1306
01:15:47,710 --> 01:15:49,280
Michael Kennedy: there were things that could have gotten in my way,

1307
01:15:49,520 --> 01:15:51,300
Michael Kennedy: but the stuff, the support that it gave me

1308
01:15:51,360 --> 01:15:53,180
Michael Kennedy: made it possible for me to feel, like,

1309
01:15:53,740 --> 01:15:54,680
Michael Kennedy: comfortable and get going.

1310
01:15:55,120 --> 01:16:00,180
Michael Kennedy: I feel like this might be an option for people who care.

1311
01:16:00,640 --> 01:16:00,980
Christopher Trudeau: Right.

1312
01:16:01,500 --> 01:16:02,900
Michael Kennedy: But let me give you an example.

1313
01:16:03,120 --> 01:16:10,920
Michael Kennedy: For example, I could go install an app that has Postgres, Valkey, and the web app.

1314
01:16:11,740 --> 01:16:17,220
Michael Kennedy: If I then I just click install that from wherever self-hosted definition that comes from,

1315
01:16:17,660 --> 01:16:18,720
Michael Kennedy: it creates those three containers.

1316
01:16:19,400 --> 01:16:24,040
Michael Kennedy: And then on the container setting through the image setting, I don't know really how you think of it.

1317
01:16:24,260 --> 01:16:26,420
Michael Kennedy: I mean, they're not, I guess, an image, sort of.

1318
01:16:28,080 --> 01:16:31,000
Michael Kennedy: You can go to the web part and say, and just use this URL.

1319
01:16:31,500 --> 01:16:34,660
Michael Kennedy: And it'll automatically do the SSL generation as part of that.

1320
01:16:34,900 --> 01:16:36,980
Michael Kennedy: Then you go to the database, the Postgres thing,

1321
01:16:37,080 --> 01:16:39,940
Michael Kennedy: you say, oh, and make backups for me daily,

1322
01:16:40,420 --> 01:16:42,660
Michael Kennedy: and store them in this S3 compatible storage.

1323
01:16:43,960 --> 01:16:46,160
Michael Kennedy: And that kind of stuff is a lot of extra

1324
01:16:46,300 --> 01:16:47,360
Michael Kennedy: when you're doing it yourself, and you just

1325
01:16:47,360 --> 01:16:48,220
Michael Kennedy: go check those boxes.

1326
01:16:48,520 --> 01:16:52,120
Michael Kennedy: So that's the two forward, but then there's the step back.

1327
01:16:52,400 --> 01:16:54,060
Christopher Trudeau: - Yeah, yeah, well, and that tends to be also

1328
01:16:54,180 --> 01:16:55,580
Christopher Trudeau: what makes people nervous, right?

1329
01:16:55,770 --> 01:16:57,580
Christopher Trudeau: So like that, and that's, you know,

1330
01:16:57,690 --> 01:17:02,340
Christopher Trudeau: I still use managed database simply because I don't want

1331
01:17:02,340 --> 01:17:03,440
Christopher Trudeau: to have to think about it, right?

1332
01:17:03,540 --> 01:17:06,180
Christopher Trudeau: Like it's like, yeah, okay, I'm perfectly fine

1333
01:17:06,250 --> 01:17:07,980
Christopher Trudeau: with pointing my app at a managed database

1334
01:17:08,720 --> 01:17:11,000
Christopher Trudeau: and let somebody else think about backing it up

1335
01:17:11,030 --> 01:17:11,780
Christopher Trudeau: and all the rest of it.

1336
01:17:12,300 --> 01:17:12,540
Michael Kennedy: - Yeah.

1337
01:17:12,920 --> 01:17:13,040
Michael Kennedy: - Yeah.

1338
01:17:13,270 --> 01:17:14,720
Michael Kennedy: - You know, one thing about managed databases

1339
01:17:14,940 --> 01:17:19,280
Michael Kennedy: that I don't like, and I can't speak to all potential hosts

1340
01:17:19,440 --> 01:17:21,760
Michael Kennedy: of them, but certainly some of them, some well-known ones,

1341
01:17:21,900 --> 01:17:23,100
Michael Kennedy: some names I've already said,

1342
01:17:23,690 --> 01:17:25,100
Michael Kennedy: if you get a managed database there,

1343
01:17:25,440 --> 01:17:28,000
Michael Kennedy: that database server is listening on the public internet.

1344
01:17:29,160 --> 01:17:33,460
Michael Kennedy: And I very much do not spouse having a database listening.

1345
01:17:34,680 --> 01:17:37,500
Michael Kennedy: Yeah, it has a password, but I mean,

1346
01:17:37,640 --> 01:17:40,180
Michael Kennedy: that database, I'm always worried about

1347
01:17:40,210 --> 01:17:41,080
Michael Kennedy: what is in the database.

1348
01:17:41,180 --> 01:17:41,800
Christopher Trudeau: - That's interesting.

1349
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:43,700
Christopher Trudeau: I've never thought to even check that.

1350
01:17:44,020 --> 01:17:48,560
Michael Kennedy: - And on my setup, not only is it not listening

1351
01:17:48,590 --> 01:17:50,980
Michael Kennedy: on the internet, it's not even listening on the host.

1352
01:17:51,220 --> 01:17:53,220
Michael Kennedy: There's like a private Docker network

1353
01:17:53,460 --> 01:17:55,520
Michael Kennedy: that only things in the Docker,

1354
01:17:56,760 --> 01:17:58,940
Michael Kennedy: shared Docker network can even know about

1355
01:17:58,950 --> 01:18:00,220
Michael Kennedy: or see the data, you know what I mean?

1356
01:18:00,840 --> 01:18:01,360
Michael Kennedy: So there's--

1357
01:18:02,520 --> 01:18:05,140
Christopher Trudeau: - Yep, it's less likely to, fewer holes.

1358
01:18:05,680 --> 01:18:08,480
Michael Kennedy: - But I have to make backups and if I don't, it's bad.

1359
01:18:08,580 --> 01:18:09,800
Michael Kennedy: And if it goes down, it's real bad.

1360
01:18:10,440 --> 01:18:11,760
Michael Kennedy: And it did one time this year,

1361
01:18:11,760 --> 01:18:12,700
Michael Kennedy: it was down for like 10 minutes,

1362
01:18:14,020 --> 01:18:15,580
Michael Kennedy: about tore a honk a hair out.

1363
01:18:15,760 --> 01:18:17,660
Christopher Trudeau: - There goes your sixth nine, yes.

1364
01:18:18,400 --> 01:18:19,240
Michael Kennedy: - Exactly, I know.

1365
01:18:20,180 --> 01:18:24,320
Michael Kennedy: So the problem was, just for people who want to benefit

1366
01:18:24,540 --> 01:18:26,280
Michael Kennedy: from my suffering and not suffer themselves,

1367
01:18:26,520 --> 01:18:28,300
Michael Kennedy: is I did not--

1368
01:18:28,760 --> 01:18:30,880
Michael Kennedy: on the Docker pull for the database image,

1369
01:18:30,980 --> 01:18:32,640
Michael Kennedy: I didn't pin it to a major version.

1370
01:18:33,900 --> 01:18:34,920
Michael Kennedy: And so it upgraded.

1371
01:18:35,040 --> 01:18:37,140
Michael Kennedy: And then it said, well, you have all data in your file system.

1372
01:18:37,640 --> 01:18:39,080
Michael Kennedy: And we're not going to upgrade it for you automatically.

1373
01:18:39,400 --> 01:18:40,260
Michael Kennedy: So we're not going to run.

1374
01:18:40,360 --> 01:18:42,060
Michael Kennedy: I'm like, why is the database server not running?

1375
01:18:43,380 --> 01:18:44,780
Michael Kennedy: And it was like a weird update.

1376
01:18:44,780 --> 01:18:48,580
Michael Kennedy: It was like 8.2.1 that broke.

1377
01:18:48,820 --> 01:18:50,180
Michael Kennedy: Well, why? Point one.

1378
01:18:51,120 --> 01:18:54,620
Michael Kennedy: Surely, surely a bigger number needs to be like,

1379
01:18:54,720 --> 01:18:55,700
Michael Kennedy: this will never run again.

1380
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:00,960
Michael Kennedy: Anyway, you find this stuff out the hard way,

1381
01:19:01,220 --> 01:19:05,800
Michael Kennedy: but that's the negative not using a managed database.

1382
01:19:06,200 --> 01:19:08,120
Christopher Trudeau: Yes. Yeah. Because you have to deal with

1383
01:19:08,260 --> 01:19:09,220
Christopher Trudeau: some of that kind of stuff yourself.

1384
01:19:10,260 --> 01:19:10,400
Christopher Trudeau: Yeah.

1385
01:19:10,530 --> 01:19:14,980
Christopher Trudeau: So I thought we would wrap up by reviving an old tradition.

1386
01:19:15,270 --> 01:19:16,660
Christopher Trudeau: I have two questions for you.

1387
01:19:17,320 --> 01:19:22,400
Christopher Trudeau: What is your development environment and what library are you excited about?

1388
01:19:23,460 --> 01:19:33,460
Michael Kennedy: So the development environment right now is a mix of cursor and PyCharm for editing.

1389
01:19:34,420 --> 01:19:38,500
Michael Kennedy: And despite this very detailed conversation about Docker,

1390
01:19:38,500 --> 01:19:42,420
Michael Kennedy: I don't use Docker very much locally for development.

1391
01:19:42,420 --> 01:19:43,680
Michael Kennedy: I just use virtual environments.

1392
01:19:43,900 --> 01:19:51,000
Michael Kennedy: And I want to give a shout out to Hynek, who I had some back and forth about when I was writing some of this stuff that gave me some really good ideas.

1393
01:19:51,110 --> 01:19:57,280
Michael Kennedy: And he has a really good article, which I reference in the book, about you just use virtual environments.

1394
01:19:57,940 --> 01:19:58,980
Michael Kennedy: Keep everything consistent, right?

1395
01:19:59,180 --> 01:20:02,600
Michael Kennedy: That's an interesting debate that we don't have time for, but it's very fun.

1396
01:20:04,040 --> 01:20:06,100
Michael Kennedy: So uv, I'm a huge fan of uv.

1397
01:20:09,160 --> 01:20:11,580
Christopher Trudeau: Particularly in Docker, that makes things that much faster.

1398
01:20:11,920 --> 01:20:34,400
Michael Kennedy: Yeah, because you can just say in your doc, it used to be you're like, okay, well, I got to use Docker and I need to use Python. So let me use the official Python distribution for Docker because I need to have Python. And then, well, that, that excludes 99.9% of all the other things you could build upon that already have something that's harder to manage, set up for you, right?

1399
01:20:34,520 --> 01:20:41,480
Michael Kennedy: But in your Docker file, you just say run uv venv --Python 3.14.

1400
01:20:43,160 --> 01:20:45,640
Michael Kennedy: You've installed Python 3.14 in two seconds.

1401
01:20:46,180 --> 01:20:46,320
Michael Kennedy: Right.

1402
01:20:46,540 --> 01:20:47,360
Michael Kennedy: And it's cached, right?

1403
01:20:47,540 --> 01:20:52,380
Michael Kennedy: It's like, yeah, it just, it makes it so much faster and so, so powerful.

1404
01:20:52,430 --> 01:20:53,760
Michael Kennedy: But also just in general, right?

1405
01:20:53,860 --> 01:20:58,600
Michael Kennedy: Like it's unified so many tools that I like that are just, it's all there together.

1406
01:20:59,400 --> 01:21:00,160
Michael Kennedy: And then library.

1407
01:21:00,400 --> 01:21:00,980
Michael Kennedy: Oh my goodness.

1408
01:21:03,300 --> 01:21:04,680
Christopher Trudeau: Now you know what it feels like.

1409
01:21:04,900 --> 01:21:05,980
Michael Kennedy: I know how it feels.

1410
01:21:06,420 --> 01:21:07,840
Christopher Trudeau: I didn't warn you on purpose.

1411
01:21:08,660 --> 01:21:09,300
Michael Kennedy: I love it.

1412
01:21:09,540 --> 01:21:10,100
Michael Kennedy: I love it.

1413
01:21:15,800 --> 01:21:19,760
Michael Kennedy: So there are a bunch of ones I've been playing with lately,

1414
01:21:19,800 --> 01:21:22,540
Michael Kennedy: and I'm trying to think which one I've used.

1415
01:21:22,640 --> 01:21:24,220
Michael Kennedy: I don't really have a great answer to this, Chris.

1416
01:21:25,140 --> 01:21:26,120
Michael Kennedy: I'm afraid to say.

1417
01:21:26,220 --> 01:21:31,640
Michael Kennedy: I would say let's keep it flowing with some of the vibes that we had here.

1418
01:21:32,240 --> 01:21:36,560
Michael Kennedy: I would say, let me give a shout out to setproctitle,

1419
01:21:37,220 --> 01:21:39,940
Michael Kennedy: which sounds insanely silly.

1420
01:21:40,320 --> 01:21:41,620
Michael Kennedy: Like the goal of that is,

1421
01:21:42,600 --> 01:21:44,620
Michael Kennedy: so in your process, in your Python process,

1422
01:21:44,860 --> 01:21:46,660
Michael Kennedy: and I actually use this on a bunch of different things.

1423
01:21:46,740 --> 01:21:51,780
Michael Kennedy: In your Python process, you can say setproctitle.settitle,

1424
01:21:52,140 --> 01:21:54,400
Michael Kennedy: and you give it the name of whatever you want your process to be.

1425
01:21:54,820 --> 01:21:55,680
Michael Kennedy: So why does that matter?

1426
01:21:57,660 --> 01:21:59,840
Michael Kennedy: When you pull up all these tools like Glances,

1427
01:22:02,340 --> 01:22:05,080
Michael Kennedy: BTOP or others, anything that looks at processes basically,

1428
01:22:06,510 --> 01:22:09,760
Michael Kennedy: instead of seeing Python, Python, Python, Node, Node, Node, Postgres, Postgres, Postgres,

1429
01:22:10,600 --> 01:22:12,700
Michael Kennedy: at least the Python ones now have meaningful names.

1430
01:22:13,600 --> 01:22:16,900
Michael Kennedy: And you might be thinking, "Well, Michael, I'm not running that much production."

1431
01:22:17,300 --> 01:22:19,580
Michael Kennedy: Useless to me. No, it's good for development too.

1432
01:22:20,400 --> 01:22:24,260
Michael Kennedy: Have you ever had the idea,

1433
01:22:25,120 --> 01:22:27,600
Michael Kennedy: "I want to know how much memory my process is using."

1434
01:22:27,820 --> 01:22:28,800
Michael Kennedy: Is it using a lot or a little?

1435
01:22:29,060 --> 01:22:32,700
Michael Kennedy: So you pull up activity monitor, task manager, whatever.

1436
01:22:33,580 --> 01:22:34,700
Michael Kennedy: And you see Python, Python, Python.

1437
01:22:34,880 --> 01:22:35,520
Michael Kennedy: You're like, oh, man.

1438
01:22:36,180 --> 01:22:38,780
Michael Kennedy: I know my editor is using one of these or whatever.

1439
01:22:39,020 --> 01:22:39,880
Michael Kennedy: But which one is it?

1440
01:22:41,020 --> 01:22:43,300
Christopher Trudeau: And if you're using the right terminal,

1441
01:22:43,540 --> 01:22:45,180
Christopher Trudeau: it'll change the terminal's title too.

1442
01:22:45,460 --> 01:22:47,540
Christopher Trudeau: Because most terminals respond to the proc name.

1443
01:22:48,500 --> 01:22:50,020
Michael Kennedy: Oh, that's a very nice touch.

1444
01:22:50,180 --> 01:22:50,520
Michael Kennedy: Yeah, OK.

1445
01:22:51,280 --> 01:22:51,580
Michael Kennedy: Yeah.

1446
01:22:52,300 --> 01:22:54,080
Michael Kennedy: But if you do that in development,

1447
01:22:54,260 --> 01:22:59,020
Michael Kennedy: if you just set the name of your process to be like my utility

1448
01:22:59,040 --> 01:23:03,460
Michael Kennedy: the heck you call it, right? Then when you go into process management tools, like even just for

1449
01:23:03,820 --> 01:23:09,720
Michael Kennedy: Mac or Windows or whatever, you'll see it. And you can see how much CPU is it using? Is it using a

1450
01:23:09,860 --> 01:23:14,980
Michael Kennedy: lot of RAM? If you've got to end task it, like we now have another reason that this is something

1451
01:23:15,100 --> 01:23:21,160
Michael Kennedy: we've got to do all the time is sometimes the agentic AI things go mad and they start a bunch

1452
01:23:21,320 --> 01:23:25,020
Michael Kennedy: of the web servers and then they lose track of them. And then you can't run anymore because it

1453
01:23:25,040 --> 01:23:33,740
Michael Kennedy: says port is in use you're like but where like something in that stream of text that shot by for

1454
01:23:33,920 --> 01:23:39,300
Michael Kennedy: five minutes it started one and then it left it going but then you pull it up it says python python

1455
01:23:39,480 --> 01:23:43,080
Michael Kennedy: python and like well i don't want to kill the other thing that's right you know what i mean

1456
01:23:43,620 --> 01:23:49,500
Michael Kennedy: and so it also gives you a way to kill off your ai abandoned stuff that it went mad on so there you

1457
01:23:49,580 --> 01:23:53,880
Christopher Trudeau: go setting a process name might save you a reboot there's there's there's your little nugget to

1458
01:23:53,900 --> 01:23:54,900
Christopher Trudeau: take away from the podcast.

1459
01:23:55,490 --> 01:23:55,600
Michael Kennedy: Exactly.

1460
01:23:56,060 --> 01:23:59,320
Michael Kennedy: It's a package with one function, but it's a good one.

1461
01:23:59,580 --> 01:23:59,960
Christopher Trudeau: Excellent.

1462
01:24:00,330 --> 01:24:01,800
Christopher Trudeau: Well, thank you for having me on.

1463
01:24:02,460 --> 01:24:05,380
Christopher Trudeau: This has been fun to sort of reverse the tables on you.

1464
01:24:05,560 --> 01:24:06,500
Christopher Trudeau: It's been great.

1465
01:24:07,240 --> 01:24:07,320
Michael Kennedy: Yeah.

1466
01:24:07,610 --> 01:24:08,360
Michael Kennedy: Chris, thank you so much.

1467
01:24:08,370 --> 01:24:09,160
Michael Kennedy: I really appreciate it.

1468
01:24:09,280 --> 01:24:10,540
Michael Kennedy: And always great to catch up with you.

1469
01:24:10,850 --> 01:24:10,940
Michael Kennedy: Bye.

1470
01:24:11,030 --> 01:24:11,500
Christopher Trudeau: Fun to be here.
