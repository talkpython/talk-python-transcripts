00:00:01.420 --> 00:00:06.560
Brett, Carol, Paul, Barry, welcome to all of you to Talk Python To Me.

00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:08.120
So happy to have you back.

00:00:09.559 --> 00:00:10.200
Hi, Michael.

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:11.500
Thanks.

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:12.820
It's great to see you.

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:23.080
I will tell you what, if the backstage pre-show is any indication of how much fun we're going to be having here, it's going to be a good

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:23.300
time.

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:23.800
I

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:31.740
hope everyone here is ready for some fun stories, some fun history, and some unexpected things out there.

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:38.360
And as I was doing this research, I see lots of your names popping up in these places.

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:40.560
Oh, there were 30 people doing Python.

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:45.760
And Barry and Paul happened to be there, like in the world sort of thing.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.780
Maybe at the conference.

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:50.480
But pretty early days, I think.

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:52.920
And so I'm very excited.

00:00:53.560 --> 00:01:05.180
to talk about just these stories, history of Python, inspired somewhat by the upcoming documentary from Cult Repo, I believe it is, that's putting it together.

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:07.100
What a fun, fun thing.

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:12.020
There was an April Fool's joke that people may have seen, but there's also a serious documentary coming, right?

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:13.520
Yes.

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:14.900
There's a trailer.

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:20.420
There was a trailer shown at PyCon just recently.

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:22.040
It was really good, too.

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:23.100
It's got

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:23.700
a good reception.

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:28.720
The people actually showed up at 8.30 in the morning, which doesn't happen a lot at Bycon.

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:31.540
I'll tell you what, that's my kind of stuff.

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:34.920
People say, what's your favorite movie, Michael?

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.600
I'm like, hmm, how am I going to answer this one?

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:42.180
How about I watch programming and other types of documentaries on YouTube?

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:44.380
Is that kind of like, no, I don't want to talk to you anymore about this.

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:46.780
It's going to be so good.

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:50.360
Is that how you extract yourself out of a conversation you want to

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:51.760
be a part of at parties now, Michael?

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:54.240
I'm just like, let me tell you about this whole documentary.

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:55.840
What do I do for fun?

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:57.780
Oh, I watch programming documentaries on YouTube.

00:01:58.260 --> 00:01:59.540
In fact, you're invited to leave.

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.600
What

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:03.080
is it?

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:03.480
Four o'clock.

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:04.340
Shut this down.

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:05.760
Exactly.

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:15.660
I imagine, though, the podcast listeners will be much more in line with, you know, being in the group that would care to pay attention to that.

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:18.100
So let's just do a super quick round of introductions.

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:22.160
I know most people know you because, as I said, you all have been doing this for a super long time.

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:28.380
But for those who are new listeners, we have many, many new listeners all the time, people getting into Python.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.020
Biggest group, as we learned from the survey, which is very interesting.

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:34.040
So maybe we'll go around the Brady Bunch squares.

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:34.920
Brett, you go first.

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:37.800
My name is Brett Cannon.

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:42.220
I am the person Paul Everett is chasing to become the second most frequent guest on this podcast.

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:48.400
I've been a Python core developer since April of 2003.

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:52.500
I've been using Python since fall of 2000.

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:56.400
I feel very lucky to be part of this deceitful group of people.

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:00.320
Yeah, I think that's the good quick summary.

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:03.200
And I know if you scroll up, Anthony Shaw beats me.

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:04.520
Oh, and Brian actually

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:04.880
beats me.

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:05.560
There's no scrolling.

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:06.220
I don't count Brian.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.720
He's an insider.

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:11.240
So, yeah, you

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.660
all are,

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:13.520
I mean, you're leading.

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:15.580
But now we have you two on here at the same time.

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:17.540
So it's just going to asymptotically.

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:19.740
Like the limit at infinity will be the same.

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:22.560
But right now.

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:23.020
That's fine.

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:23.860
Yeah.

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:24.920
I think that's fair.

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:25.580
That's fair to me.

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:26.600
Yeah.

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:29.020
It's been a little while since we had you on the show, Brett.

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:29.760
Awesome to have you back.

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:30.800
Yes.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:31.060
Thanks.

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:32.960
Lock files took a bit longer than I expected.

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:34.960
Carol.

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:35.260
Hello.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:36.360
Hi.

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:37.580
I'm Carol Willing.

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:40.800
Brett, your lock files got lots of love at PyCon, just so you know.

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:42.320
I

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:43.820
am the baby of this

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:44.200
group.

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:47.100
I started using PyCon in 2012.

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:55.840
And 2017 became a core developer and had some fun on the steering council with some of these cool folks.

00:03:56.240 --> 00:04:11.720
And so these days I spend a third of my time working and often in the open science, data science space with open source projects there, sit on some boards, do some angel investing.

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:48.800
the other happy third is I donate a whole lot of time not just to open source but actually to mentoring individuals one-on-one in who are trying to get more involved in open source or learn things and that is probably my biggest joy in life and then the third of my Python-y kind of life is being able to dig deep and to whatever projects rock my world and get a little time, hopefully, to play with some open hardware, blinky, wearable electronics stuff.

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:50.820
So I just love Python.

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:52.020
I love the community.

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:55.720
And whatever the other third, Paul is going to share with us later.

00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:58.740
Paul has many thirds, many thirds.

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:02.740
I didn't realize, Carol, our Python age is almost the same, exactly.

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:04.560
Oh, good. Well,

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:05.360
you can join me

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:07.180
in the toddlerdom of Python.

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:07.440
Yeah,

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:12.920
exactly. We'll have to stay home while the grown-ups like Paul go out who've been at this for a little while.

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:14.860
Paul, what, five years now, is it?

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:18.060
Five in dog years? That's not

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:18.660
even in there.

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:20.340
You've got to make a log scale.

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:29.760
Yeah, Carol's right. There is another third. The bonus third of this episode will be a discussion of Sphinx talk trees, their

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:30.300
implementation.

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:36.100
And it kind of ends in like a biker horror movie mashup.

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:37.440
So stay tuned.

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:39.100
Hi, I'm Paul.

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:49.580
Barry and I met in 1994 at a workshop on this irrelevant, no chance to succeed project called Python.

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:54.820
Fun fact, just before that, I was a Navy officer.

00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:56.100
I had the white uniform.

00:05:56.680 --> 00:06:00.040
I was wearing the white uniform when I started Python.

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:01.620
That's cool.

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:02.540
That's pretty cool.

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:11.140
I run developer advocacy at JetBrains, and I get to spend my Friday with the four people that I just love the most.

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:13.140
This is so cool being with you.

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:14.140
This trailer

00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:15.320
and

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:17.740
the documentary has just reminded me of

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:18.100
all the

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:20.840
joy that we get to be a part of and we get to give.

00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:22.360
And so this is just really joyful.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:24.080
Yeah.

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:26.480
Well, it is always awesome to have you here, Paul.

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:27.540
Thanks for that.

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:28.680
Great to be here.

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:30.040
With you, Barry.

00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:30.900
Hello, hello.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:34.740
Hey, good to see everyone, of course.

00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:38.880
Saw some of you at PyCon just recently.

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:41.300
Barry Warsaw, yeah.

00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:44.260
Paul and I met a long, long time ago.

00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:46.080
Worked together for a while.

00:06:48.639 --> 00:06:54.960
And, you know, I was very lucky because I had worked at NIST in Gaithersburg, Maryland.

00:06:56.780 --> 00:07:02.260
sort of my first gig, actually high school, college, and then my first gig coming out of college.

00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:12.900
And so I knew people at NIST. And I had actually seen mention of Python before that, because I was a Usenet, if anybody remembers, all the gray hairs will remember

00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:13.700
Usenet.

00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:25.020
And CompLangPython came up, and I was like, oh, cool. I was into languages, checked it out. And it was all Monty Python jokes, Which, you know, was awesome because, like, I loved Monty Python.

00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:27.180
But I was like, why is this in comp lang?

00:07:27.540 --> 00:07:29.800
You know, what does it have to do with computer programming languages?

00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:41.080
And sort of ignored it for a little while and then got an email from a friend of ours, Mike McClay, and Ken Mannheimer, who I think were still there at NIST.

00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:43.360
And I knew them from my time there.

00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:53.720
And so we went up for the workshop and met Guido and a bunch of other people who were like, yeah, okay, this is kind of a fun little hobby thing, you know.

00:07:54.660 --> 00:07:56.820
And then we decided we were going to try to take over the world.

00:07:57.060 --> 00:07:59.600
And, you know, 30 years later, I guess we have.

00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:13.140
Well, in some actual real literal senses, I would say, you know, the number one programming language in a lot of ways and the number one language for AI, which is trying to take over the world in its own right.

00:08:13.380 --> 00:08:14.120
So actually

00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:23.580
I was at the European Space Museum in the Netherlands and I saw the Mars rover and we're not taking over just this world, baby.

00:08:24.440 --> 00:08:24.800
That's right.

00:08:25.660 --> 00:08:26.300
Flask flies.

00:08:28.420 --> 00:08:29.520
Well, no, we're actually on

00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:29.880
the rover.

00:08:30.700 --> 00:08:31.440
That's what I mean.

00:08:32.620 --> 00:08:33.060
It's

00:08:33.060 --> 00:08:34.080
not just the flight plan.

00:08:34.419 --> 00:08:37.919
Yeah, the flask cap for planning the helicopter. I can't remember the name of it.

00:08:37.950 --> 00:08:39.580
You can go to GitHub and get the code.

00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:40.520
Yeah,

00:08:40.620 --> 00:08:40.860
Python

00:08:40.860 --> 00:08:44.159
was actually used to process the video on the landing of the latest Mars rover.

00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:46.140
That is so cool.

00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:46.800
Yeah.

00:08:47.880 --> 00:08:48.120
Yeah.

00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:49.400
It's come a long way since.

00:08:49.580 --> 00:08:50.020
I mean, it's pretty

00:08:50.020 --> 00:09:02.500
mind blowing because like, you know, you know, the story I tell is that we had people at that first workshop who explicitly said, you cannot tell people that we're here and that we're using Python because it's our competitive advantage.

00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:04.160
And,

00:09:04.860 --> 00:09:30.080
you know, I mean, that was like, that was amazing that, you know, here we are, you know, fans of the language and just really just loved the way it kind of expressed our thoughts in a very uh direct manner and yet we couldn't tell people you know who was there because um because of that that that fact but you know that's not that's not true today you know everybody uses python so

00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:39.400
but but that actually lasted a long time like i remember uh when i was at jupiter con Do you remember when that was in New York?

00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:40.660
Was that 2016?

00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:44.500
I think 2017, 18, 19.

00:09:46.180 --> 00:09:47.320
Depending on which one.

00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:50.200
The one I gave a little keynote at.

00:09:51.500 --> 00:09:52.540
I think that was 2017.

00:09:53.540 --> 00:09:56.440
I was there and work had me go talk to a bank.

00:09:57.700 --> 00:10:01.260
But I can't name the bank because they viewed Python as a competitive advantage

00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:01.560
still.

00:10:06.680 --> 00:10:07.560
It's still...

00:10:07.580 --> 00:10:16.500
of Python, a recent development that everyone can just say they use Python because it's no longer a competitive advantage because it's literally everyone's advantage. So it kind of washes out.

00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:19.620
Yeah, it lasted for a long time as that.

00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:21.260
Yeah, totally.

00:10:21.700 --> 00:10:22.460
And now it's like

00:10:22.460 --> 00:10:22.980
you could

00:10:22.980 --> 00:10:26.940
name 20 banks in New York that use Python as their competitive advantage.

00:10:27.500 --> 00:10:28.060
All in different

00:10:28.060 --> 00:10:28.400
ways.

00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:31.220
And it's not a secret anymore either, right? Like Capital

00:10:31.220 --> 00:10:31.680
One being

00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:33.660
that big sponsor at PyCon

00:10:33.660 --> 00:10:34.300
News every year.

00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:34.920
It's just like, yeah.

00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:40.820
I remember when that started. I came from being in Europe for a few years and went to my first PyCon.

00:10:42.180 --> 00:10:47.480
And I saw this big booth with Capital One on top and I'm like, what the absolute bleep?

00:10:47.660 --> 00:10:48.660
Capital One is

00:10:48.660 --> 00:10:51.560
here and these consulting firms are here.

00:10:51.660 --> 00:10:52.740
What happened to you, Python?

00:10:53.900 --> 00:10:54.960
What's in your compiler?

00:10:57.380 --> 00:10:57.800
That's good.

00:10:58.620 --> 00:10:58.740
Thank

00:10:58.740 --> 00:10:58.920
you.

00:10:59.450 --> 00:11:00.120
Or should it be Jen?

00:11:00.170 --> 00:11:00.400
I mean,

00:11:00.540 --> 00:11:01.720
Jen is really where it's at these days.

00:11:01.860 --> 00:11:03.560
They actually were sponsors of Talk Python.

00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:04.240
I'm like,

00:11:04.300 --> 00:11:09.120
I don't really, I mean, as much fun as that was to say, I don't really want to just advertise credit cards.

00:11:09.210 --> 00:11:10.720
I want stuff that's relevant to listeners.

00:11:10.850 --> 00:11:11.460
And they're like, no, no, no.

00:11:11.750 --> 00:11:12.980
We want to advertise for our

00:11:12.980 --> 00:11:13.740
data science team.

00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:14.600
I'm like, okay,

00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:15.400
that's really cool, yeah.

00:11:15.720 --> 00:11:15.800
Yeah,

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:16.300
Richmond,

00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:16.780
Virginia.

00:11:16.850 --> 00:11:17.520
They got a big team.

00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:18.400
Yeah.

00:11:18.560 --> 00:11:24.840
Just for the international audience who's not from North America, Capital One has a very famous tagline in their ads that says, what's in your wallet?

00:11:25.100 --> 00:11:25.340
Hence the

00:11:25.340 --> 00:11:26.380
Wessner compiler line.

00:11:26.460 --> 00:11:29.260
And they say kind of in that gruff way.

00:11:30.520 --> 00:11:31.240
Yeah, exactly.

00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:32.820
As gruff as I can.

00:11:32.980 --> 00:11:33.060
Vikings

00:11:33.060 --> 00:11:35.940
and all sorts of different ways of pitching that line.

00:11:36.500 --> 00:11:36.680
Yeah.

00:11:36.860 --> 00:11:47.200
Speaking of pop culture, one thing I wanted to talk about in this sort of history, anything that you see, and Barry, you touched on this.

00:11:47.280 --> 00:11:56.080
I'm going to put the holy hand grenade scene with the killer rabbit up here just to look at, which is such an amazing thing.

00:11:57.280 --> 00:12:03.860
But if you look at all the logos and slogans and all this kind of stuff, it's all about snakes, right?

00:12:04.340 --> 00:12:05.620
snake icons, snake logos.

00:12:06.580 --> 00:12:12.540
But the original motivation for the language is actually Monty Python, not ball pythons, right?

00:12:13.920 --> 00:12:14.500
Mm-hmm.

00:12:15.660 --> 00:12:17.000
Yeah, and I remember...

00:12:17.300 --> 00:12:17.880
In fact,

00:12:19.620 --> 00:12:22.340
are you going to talk about the first book, the O'Reilly book?

00:12:22.340 --> 00:12:22.440
Yep.

00:12:23.400 --> 00:12:24.080
Go ahead.

00:12:25.560 --> 00:12:40.400
I remember when the O'Reilly book was about to be published, and I think we saw an early copy of it or something like that, And O'Reilly, obviously, because they were animal themes, they wanted to put a snake on the front.

00:12:40.590 --> 00:12:53.860
I remember distinctly, maybe misremember, everything I say could be totally misremembered, but I remember Guido saying, I don't want a snake on the front of it, because people have a version of snakes.

00:12:54.310 --> 00:12:58.440
And I mean, anyway, so.

00:13:01.900 --> 00:13:12.100
Yeah, no, I have a similar recollection of, yeah, I mean, at least at the PyCon US in 2003 was, yeah, I remember that comic going around too.

00:13:12.110 --> 00:13:14.360
Because Learning Python's got the little mouse on it.

00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:16.460
But yeah, Program Python has this.

00:13:16.880 --> 00:13:17.160
Michael,

00:13:17.500 --> 00:13:22.840
if I give you a search for the worst book cover, Internet Programming with Python.

00:13:25.320 --> 00:13:27.220
And so Guido joined

00:13:27.220 --> 00:13:28.020
with, oh,

00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:29.220
Aaron, what's his name?

00:13:29.740 --> 00:13:31.040
Yeah, there we go, right there.

00:13:31.880 --> 00:13:34.460
so zoom in a little it's a

00:13:34.460 --> 00:13:34.820
snake

00:13:34.820 --> 00:13:38.860
around a can of spam with glasses with Guido's glasses on it

00:13:39.540 --> 00:13:40.580
and our graphic

00:13:40.580 --> 00:13:44.560
designer at Digital Creations at the time came up with this amazing

00:13:44.560 --> 00:13:45.000
and

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:45.100
I'm

00:13:45.100 --> 00:13:52.920
not sure if I'm proud of this story or not I think this story that's a fine looking snake although it does

00:13:52.920 --> 00:13:59.880
bear a resemblance to a more frequently used emoji these days honestly but you

00:13:59.880 --> 00:14:11.440
can imagine her face when i said okay what i want is a snake around a can of spam with with european glasses and she was she she she did it

00:14:11.440 --> 00:14:17.320
so i have a question for the old timers in the group when did it become two snakes

00:14:17.320 --> 00:14:21.260
oh you mean the

00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:21.920
current that

00:14:21.920 --> 00:14:29.600
was that was the redesign it was the redesign and I

00:14:29.600 --> 00:14:32.080
think Guido's brother was involved

00:14:33.820 --> 00:14:34.540
wasn't he?

00:14:35.540 --> 00:14:39.080
wasn't that I can't remember his first name

00:14:39.560 --> 00:14:40.200
something

00:14:40.200 --> 00:14:40.720
Rankin

00:14:41.140 --> 00:14:41.580
used

00:14:42.440 --> 00:14:43.000
I

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:43.980
mean it's used but I don't think

00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:44.440
was used

00:14:44.440 --> 00:14:44.820
involved

00:14:44.820 --> 00:14:54.720
in the redesign because I was actually part of the back when we called them webmasters the web team for python.org when

00:14:54.720 --> 00:14:55.760
the

00:14:55.760 --> 00:14:56.900
redesign was done because that was also

00:14:56.900 --> 00:14:57.540
when we did

00:14:58.100 --> 00:14:59.640
the back end, right?

00:14:59.880 --> 00:15:02.460
Because that was the whole, we want to keep all the files

00:15:02.460 --> 00:15:02.900
static.

00:15:03.640 --> 00:15:05.660
There's always an episode, isn't there, Michael?

00:15:05.680 --> 00:15:06.120
There

00:15:06.120 --> 00:15:06.920
you go.

00:15:07.660 --> 00:15:08.160
Right, that was one

00:15:08.160 --> 00:15:11.620
of the requirements Oz had, actually, because he was the big driver of the website back then.

00:15:11.760 --> 00:15:15.600
It's like, I don't want to have a CMS-back thing.

00:15:15.830 --> 00:15:19.540
He wanted old files and was all literally with make files to generate it.

00:15:21.020 --> 00:15:26.320
But yeah, I can't, I think that's literally just, They hired a graphic designer who also redid the back end at the same time.

00:15:27.060 --> 00:15:28.020
And they went with it.

00:15:28.760 --> 00:15:28.980
Because, I

00:15:28.980 --> 00:15:29.420
mean, if you go

00:15:29.420 --> 00:15:34.280
back to that logo, I mean, that was back when there was a little pixelated snake as the icon.

00:15:34.620 --> 00:15:35.700
I think Windows was there.

00:15:37.180 --> 00:15:40.140
So we were already kind of going with it at that point.

00:15:40.860 --> 00:15:41.080
Nice.

00:15:41.840 --> 00:15:43.020
What year was that around?

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:45.660
Long ago.

00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:48.800
This is all

00:15:48.800 --> 00:15:49.200
long ago.

00:15:50.980 --> 00:15:53.360
That would be like the rise of the Pycons.

00:15:53.460 --> 00:15:55.180
So PSF was 2001.

00:15:55.640 --> 00:15:56.960
PyCon was 2003.

00:15:58.160 --> 00:15:59.660
So it was probably around that time of

00:15:59.660 --> 00:16:00.020
PyCon.

00:16:00.220 --> 00:16:00.500
Yeah.

00:16:01.020 --> 00:16:01.740
Probably the knots.

00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:02.540
I think it was

00:16:02.540 --> 00:16:03.280
sometime in the

00:16:03.280 --> 00:16:03.840
knots, maybe.

00:16:06.080 --> 00:16:10.480
By the way, I'm always scared about the documentary about being wrong on so many dates.

00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:11.680
Yes, I can imagine.

00:16:13.880 --> 00:16:14.360
Really?

00:16:16.060 --> 00:16:22.340
Because everything is related in my head to PyCon and where they physically were held.

00:16:23.120 --> 00:16:23.480
And this

00:16:23.480 --> 00:16:30.500
is why if you watch the documentary, the opener is me asking Google, when was PyCon held in Montreal?

00:16:30.730 --> 00:16:32.600
Because that's like when I know I did something.

00:16:32.860 --> 00:16:33.460
And it said 2015.

00:16:33.710 --> 00:16:34.320
And I go like, what

00:16:34.320 --> 00:16:34.680
the hell?

00:16:34.680 --> 00:16:35.080
And 2014.

00:16:36.080 --> 00:16:36.820
Well, that was the deal.

00:16:36.960 --> 00:16:37.800
That's why I

00:16:37.800 --> 00:16:38.080
went, what?

00:16:38.380 --> 00:16:42.780
Because I realized that we started on even numbers at that point after we did the first three years in D.C.

00:16:43.160 --> 00:16:44.940
And we went to two years after that.

00:16:44.990 --> 00:16:45.640
And I was like, what?

00:16:46.560 --> 00:16:49.720
Anyway, I'm just waiting to find out multiple times in the documentary.

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:52.800
I said the year wrong because I got the date wrong.

00:16:53.060 --> 00:16:58.280
So when it was, I know exactly which bike on it, what location, but I got the year wrong for when it was in that location.

00:16:58.520 --> 00:16:58.780
All right.

00:16:58.920 --> 00:17:00.300
So you're a quick one of attendees.

00:17:01.300 --> 00:17:03.280
There's a lightning talk opportunity.

00:17:03.800 --> 00:17:07.199
Find all the errors that Brent had and make it into a lightning talk.

00:17:08.319 --> 00:17:09.140
If it just gets cut

00:17:09.140 --> 00:17:11.120
from the documentary entirely, it was

00:17:11.120 --> 00:17:11.380
just

00:17:11.380 --> 00:17:11.800
too much work

00:17:11.800 --> 00:17:12.480
to correct it.

00:17:12.540 --> 00:17:12.900
You know what?

00:17:13.100 --> 00:17:16.140
Yeah, there's too many asterisks in what Brent just said to throw up on.

00:17:17.140 --> 00:17:18.780
We used up all the letters on corrections.

00:17:18.959 --> 00:17:19.260
We

00:17:19.260 --> 00:17:19.720
can't do it.

00:17:19.740 --> 00:17:27.199
Find all of Brett's errors so you won't look at ours, you know.

00:17:27.699 --> 00:17:27.900
There

00:17:27.900 --> 00:17:28.240
you go.

00:17:30.220 --> 00:17:31.800
No, I think you guys were awesome.

00:17:32.100 --> 00:17:36.960
At least the trailer and the April 1st sort of thing.

00:17:37.220 --> 00:17:37.840
That was really great.

00:17:38.780 --> 00:17:46.920
So here, I want to throw this out here, and you all tell me about the history of it because I know it gets used all the time, and I think it might be close to home.

00:17:47.980 --> 00:17:50.180
I came for the language, stayed for the community.

00:17:51.520 --> 00:17:51.680
Hmm.

00:17:52.620 --> 00:17:52.740
Any?

00:17:53.980 --> 00:17:54.240
Brett?

00:17:54.500 --> 00:18:00.120
Yeah, so that, I mean, that's probably why I was asking Google when Montreal was.

00:18:00.140 --> 00:18:05.100
Because, yeah, that was 2014, as Carol just made sure I remembered correctly.

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:11.860
In Montreal, Diana Clark was the chair that year of PyCon.

00:18:12.260 --> 00:18:19.620
And she basically had a little bit of stage fright and just asked if, as a fellow Canadian, if I was willing to do the opening address.

00:18:21.740 --> 00:18:22.880
And I said, sure.

00:18:23.090 --> 00:18:24.500
I mean, you're just going to read slides.

00:18:24.530 --> 00:18:25.060
It's no big deal.

00:18:25.060 --> 00:18:25.980
And I was like, yeah, sure, sure.

00:18:26.820 --> 00:18:28.920
But I realized how much time they gave me.

00:18:29.740 --> 00:18:31.420
And I also realized how fast I talk.

00:18:31.560 --> 00:18:34.140
Because Thomas Wooders every year almost reminds

00:18:34.140 --> 00:18:35.820
me how fast I talk during my presentations.

00:18:37.960 --> 00:18:38.320
And

00:18:38.320 --> 00:18:40.500
I knew I was going to have some extra time at the end.

00:18:41.060 --> 00:18:42.580
And I was like, I'm going to say some stuff.

00:18:43.340 --> 00:18:44.240
I don't know what I'm going to say.

00:18:44.380 --> 00:18:45.200
I'm going to say some stuff.

00:18:46.440 --> 00:18:50.380
Because it's like, how often do you get to, I mean, at that point, I hadn't given a keynote at PyCon.

00:18:50.560 --> 00:18:52.480
So I was like, okay, cool.

00:18:52.620 --> 00:18:54.900
This is going to be like the largest stage I'm probably ever going to have.

00:18:55.500 --> 00:18:56.420
So I'm going to take advantage.

00:18:57.080 --> 00:18:58.440
So I did the opening and got through it.

00:18:58.520 --> 00:19:00.840
I had like, I can't remember, five or ten minutes to kill.

00:19:02.280 --> 00:19:03.720
And so I just started talking.

00:19:04.960 --> 00:19:10.320
And as I was talking, that line came out of my mouth just to try to, yeah, thank goodness.

00:19:11.800 --> 00:19:16.540
to try to just express how I felt about the community as

00:19:16.540 --> 00:19:28.680
my way of kind of just saying thank you to the audience because I also wanted to portray personal appreciation for what everyone had come represent to me and what hopefully the whole room represented to each other was

00:19:28.680 --> 00:19:29.220
the

00:19:29.220 --> 00:19:33.900
room is what makes Python and Python in general, not just

00:19:33.900 --> 00:19:34.680
the

00:19:34.680 --> 00:19:39.420
little piece of technology full of bits that we ship around the world and to Mars.

00:19:40.860 --> 00:19:42.300
so yeah so that's all

00:19:42.300 --> 00:19:45.980
that that's awesome yeah just visit PyCon once and you realize

00:19:47.059 --> 00:19:48.700
how much humanity and how

00:19:48.700 --> 00:19:55.660
much people care and how much just you know it's different

00:19:55.660 --> 00:20:02.360
Barbara and Katie I think Katie was involved organized a workshop for kids and Barry's kid and my kid were there

00:20:03.060 --> 00:20:03.600
oh my goodness

00:20:04.410 --> 00:20:04.600
yeah

00:20:04.600 --> 00:20:05.140
that's

00:20:05.140 --> 00:20:05.320
right

00:20:06.020 --> 00:20:06.400
that's right

00:20:08.480 --> 00:20:14.520
that's great You know, I think about that, you know, that community thing.

00:20:15.600 --> 00:20:16.900
It's really unique.

00:20:19.280 --> 00:20:22.460
And I think it comes from, you know, Guido, right?

00:20:22.760 --> 00:20:29.760
Like, you know, he brings this humanity to a cold technology, so to speak.

00:20:30.580 --> 00:20:37.180
But it's something I have felt, and I'm sure Paul has felt that since the first day, you know.

00:20:37.720 --> 00:20:47.280
That first workshop, it just felt like, hey, we're just hanging out and talking about computers and programming and stuff like that.

00:20:48.820 --> 00:20:56.080
I have my best friends still today, certainly in technology, have been from the Python community.

00:20:57.760 --> 00:20:57.940
It's

00:20:57.940 --> 00:20:58.460
always been there.

00:20:58.460 --> 00:20:58.760
Yeah, I think

00:20:58.760 --> 00:21:01.000
it's definitely driven by Guido.

00:21:01.220 --> 00:21:05.780
I mean, I have a very distinct memory from PyCon in Cleveland.

00:21:06.600 --> 00:21:13.200
I've seen Guido get down on his knees to talk to a 12-year-old saying, hey, what have you been working on?

00:21:13.430 --> 00:21:14.020
You want to show me?

00:21:14.100 --> 00:21:14.940
Like, oh, that's so cool.

00:21:15.960 --> 00:21:22.280
I mean, it's the creative of the language, and he's just getting down to some little 12-year-old and

00:21:22.280 --> 00:21:23.060
just doing something.

00:21:23.170 --> 00:21:33.560
It just wants to just connect with that kid and just have that conversation and just have that little one-on-one time and just, oh, yeah, just show this grown-up what you've done and just show off and be cool and all that.

00:21:34.680 --> 00:21:50.600
I think that really has Guido's approach to all this has really led to all this because I think Guido's approach made people similar to him, Paul and Barry and all of us on this call, gravitate towards this community and this language because of it.

00:21:50.620 --> 00:21:53.980
And it just becomes a bit effectively self-sustaining, right?

00:21:54.140 --> 00:21:54.280
Because

00:21:54.280 --> 00:21:55.100
people

00:21:55.100 --> 00:21:57.840
who are not into this leave, right?

00:21:58.020 --> 00:21:59.220
They just don't like it.

00:21:59.260 --> 00:22:00.740
It doesn't match their view.

00:22:01.400 --> 00:22:07.280
And either they stay and stay quiet or they get vocal and leave because it just doesn't work the way they want it to work.

00:22:07.280 --> 00:22:08.020
And that's totally fine.

00:22:08.160 --> 00:22:11.660
Like, I'm not no shade to anyone who's just not into the way the community functions.

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:19.580
But I think it just becomes a center of gravity here to just bring more and more people who think and operate this way.

00:22:20.240 --> 00:22:21.380
And it becomes a thing.

00:22:21.400 --> 00:22:26.440
And I think we've luckily hit a critical point here where we're able to self-sustain this kind of feeling.

00:22:26.980 --> 00:22:39.600
Because we have gotten large enough, but we also put in the effort because the people who get drawn in are to try to keep it feeling small and somewhat intimate and just this wonderful community we have.

00:22:39.720 --> 00:22:43.440
So I think it's lovely that it's ended up turning out this way.

00:22:43.540 --> 00:23:10.100
And I think, you know, I've done some keynotes about Python and learning, and I think it was baked into the language at the start, like, you know, the influence that ABC had and the, in particular, how readable the language is and the intention that, hey, you write code once, but you maintain it for a long time after.

00:23:11.020 --> 00:23:18.740
And I think, you know, the language itself on some level is much more welcoming than a lot of programming languages.

00:23:19.100 --> 00:23:34.260
And I think, you know, that coupled with the strength of the community and the education focus of the community, like, you know, you were saying the kids workshops and stuff at PyCon, it's pretty cool.

00:23:34.540 --> 00:23:37.180
And it makes it more inclusive by design.

00:23:37.920 --> 00:24:05.360
On that point, Carol, I was reading, Michael put together show notes for us, and it reminded me of you winning the Frank Willison Award. Richly deserved, and a wonderful guy he was. And so I was doing some reading on that, and I came across an interview with Jessi McKellar, and she was talking about her phase, which we might get to a little bit later, and that Guido showed up in 2015 on stage with Python is for Girls, a t-shirt saying Python is for Girls.

00:24:06.440 --> 00:24:11.660
And he's done things like that repeatedly, like the call for a CPython core contributor.

00:24:12.820 --> 00:24:14.500
And, you know, you lead from the front.

00:24:16.260 --> 00:24:20.880
And the outcome is predictable when you see the origin.

00:24:22.380 --> 00:24:22.580
Yeah.

00:24:23.080 --> 00:24:30.040
I mean, I remember the first conversation I had when I went with Guido was actually he was on stage.

00:24:30.280 --> 00:24:33.060
And I was like, will you sprint with PyLadies?

00:24:33.280 --> 00:24:40.260
After Selena Dekelman kind of said, you need to tell people that I was actually at the language summit.

00:24:40.290 --> 00:24:44.540
I just had to leave early because my baby needed to be picked up from childcare.

00:24:45.320 --> 00:24:48.800
And I'm like, okay, this is exactly what I want to do.

00:24:49.040 --> 00:24:52.220
Like, tell the creator of Python, oops, you made a mistake.

00:24:52.680 --> 00:24:54.660
And, oh, by the way, will you sprint with PyLadies?

00:24:55.440 --> 00:24:55.820
And he

00:24:55.820 --> 00:24:57.240
had that nice pause.

00:24:58.220 --> 00:25:01.340
And then he was like, yes, I will.

00:25:01.800 --> 00:25:08.840
And then I promptly went to the bathroom, was in tears, had a talk like the next talk schedule.

00:25:09.540 --> 00:25:11.360
And Brett, do you mind if I tell the story?

00:25:12.200 --> 00:25:12.540
No, no, no.

00:25:13.100 --> 00:25:13.380
Okay.

00:25:14.820 --> 00:25:22.300
So a few of the core developers came because I was giving a talk about how to contribute to core development, but not being a core developer.

00:25:23.620 --> 00:25:26.660
And after all of that happened, I was so nervous.

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:52.900
So Brett was on stage wishing me well. And I'm like, can you just stand up here for a while just till it gets going? And then like the nerves were getting higher and higher. And I was like, will you hold my hand? And he said yes. And he's like, how long do you want me to stay up here? I said, well, about five slides in. I have this young man who was my son in a bathrobe playing trombone.

00:25:53.140 --> 00:25:55.660
If I give you the thumbs up, you can sit down.

00:25:55.770 --> 00:25:56.800
If not, please stay.

00:25:56.970 --> 00:25:59.260
And fortunately, I was able to do the thumbs up.

00:25:59.430 --> 00:26:04.580
But I wouldn't have gotten to that place had it not been for Brett's kindness and support.

00:26:04.920 --> 00:26:12.160
And it's something that, you know, it shows, A, who Brett is.

00:26:12.700 --> 00:26:20.140
But, you know, there have been many, many things where people have given selflessly in different ways to so many different people.

00:26:20.300 --> 00:26:21.320
That's a lovely story.

00:26:21.900 --> 00:26:23.460
That's what I love about Python.

00:26:24.340 --> 00:26:24.740
Yeah.

00:26:25.660 --> 00:26:30.280
I mean, I think that also shows, I mean, thank you for the kind words.

00:26:31.580 --> 00:26:35.880
I will say, I mean, I did that because, I mean, it's hard to talk in front of an audience.

00:26:36.060 --> 00:26:38.620
And I learned that through my talks at PyCon.

00:26:39.100 --> 00:26:44.480
And I think that also shows through the way conferences typically handle first-time speakers too, right?

00:26:44.560 --> 00:26:54.980
Like all the effort that goes in to try to have like open office hours and tutorials and letting people come in and putting an emphasis to let first-time speakers come and do all that stuff.

00:26:55.520 --> 00:27:11.420
I think that also is a good showing of how the community, once again, really does try to lead based on how we set ourselves moving forward of trying to be welcoming and open and just a great place.

00:27:11.610 --> 00:27:15.880
I will also say, though, I think the humor of the language also has really helped.

00:27:16.940 --> 00:27:19.260
I think the Fluffle could probably speak well to that.

00:27:21.500 --> 00:27:26.040
we're going to have a performance we're going to have a performance that remixes

00:27:26.040 --> 00:27:30.260
some awesome humor and some humor and it's really good actually before we get to

00:27:30.260 --> 00:28:01.860
that though I want to focus on a different story which I just delighted me to no end and that's when I first got into Python and that's you can open up the REPL or I guess you could write it in a Python file but I'm not sure why you would do it but you can type import anti-gravity and I heard about import this. What is this anti-gravity? So first of all, there's this XKCD joke comic that said, there's a person flying and says, how are you flying? Python. I learned it last night. Everything's so

00:28:01.860 --> 00:28:02.160
simple.

00:28:02.540 --> 00:28:22.640
Hello world is just print. Hello world. I know. I don't know. Dynamic typing, white space. Come join us. The programming is fun again. It's a whole new world. But how are you flying? I just typed import anti-gravity. I think it's the Python, right? Well, there's the comic and then there's, well, actually, let's just add that as a feature to the language, right?

00:28:24.120 --> 00:28:24.420
Amazing.

00:28:25.160 --> 00:28:26.280
Imagine getting that into Java.

00:28:30.780 --> 00:28:31.840
Oracle would never have it.

00:28:34.240 --> 00:28:34.460
But I

00:28:34.460 --> 00:28:35.140
think fun

00:28:35.140 --> 00:28:35.820
is...

00:28:36.380 --> 00:28:36.960
Go ahead, Brett.

00:28:37.640 --> 00:28:43.620
I was going to say, now if we could just make that to be the most popular Python XKCD comic again and not the one about environment management.

00:28:44.920 --> 00:28:46.080
I don't even know what you're talking about.

00:28:46.200 --> 00:28:46.920
We won't speak of it.

00:28:47.660 --> 00:28:47.820
Thank you.

00:28:47.880 --> 00:28:49.320
I have plans.

00:28:50.880 --> 00:28:55.380
You know, it's funny because fun is such a big part of programming.

00:28:55.630 --> 00:28:58.360
I think that gets under-recognized in play.

00:28:59.020 --> 00:28:59.460
And

00:28:59.460 --> 00:29:05.420
I've been programming since I was a fifth grader growing up in the shadow of Bell Labs on a mainframe.

00:29:06.260 --> 00:29:14.180
And got to program on some of the first Apple computers, which was absolutely mind-blowing because it was all this exploration.

00:29:15.780 --> 00:29:19.600
And Luciano Romolo, he and I have had lots of conversations on this.

00:29:19.820 --> 00:29:29.360
But Python, you know, fast forward many, many years till 2012, because that was probably 1977 or so when I was using the Apple.

00:29:30.260 --> 00:29:34.200
Python gave me that same fun and exploration.

00:29:34.830 --> 00:29:36.760
And I'm like, this is so cool.

00:29:37.740 --> 00:29:39.780
And it's a joy to program in.

00:29:39.860 --> 00:29:42.320
And I had done C, C++, and I love C.

00:29:43.260 --> 00:29:44.420
C++, not so much.

00:29:44.620 --> 00:29:48.040
and Java and other languages list.

00:29:48.900 --> 00:29:53.980
But Python was the one that was like, this just gets out of my way and lets me create.

00:29:54.460 --> 00:29:59.440
And I think that's fun at whatever level you are as a developer.

00:30:00.220 --> 00:30:00.500
Yes.

00:30:02.900 --> 00:30:03.060
Yeah.

00:30:03.720 --> 00:30:04.040
I think

00:30:04.040 --> 00:30:04.580
that

00:30:04.580 --> 00:30:05.280
also translates

00:30:05.280 --> 00:30:06.520
to...

00:30:08.540 --> 00:30:09.120
Go ahead, Barry.

00:30:09.260 --> 00:30:12.780
I was just going to say that translates to the development of the language itself.

00:30:14.960 --> 00:30:48.540
and the fact that you can and this comes back to the whole community thing as well you can't have a language that is not only vibrant for 30 years but in some ways at its peak 30 years after its inception and will probably be so for another 10 or 15, 20 years because it's so welcoming to bring people into the development of the language itself and You can choose how to be involved in Python and move it forward.

00:30:48.780 --> 00:30:54.440
It's not some faceless committee that is pushing Python forward.

00:30:54.620 --> 00:31:00.160
It's just people like everybody else who have their own itch, want to have some fun and dive in.

00:31:00.400 --> 00:31:10.040
And that was something that Guido was always very adamant about is that the implementation was very approachable, just like the language, just like the community.

00:31:10.360 --> 00:31:12.720
So it's what keeps it alive for everybody.

00:31:13.580 --> 00:31:15.500
I'll give a case of point from

00:31:16.200 --> 00:31:17.140
I'll give a case of point

00:31:17.140 --> 00:31:21.480
from a couple of hours ago involving Barry some interpreters which have

00:31:21.480 --> 00:31:22.820
taken the most

00:31:22.820 --> 00:31:24.860
circuitous path in history

00:31:24.860 --> 00:31:25.500
possibly

00:31:26.500 --> 00:31:31.480
and Barry gets to announce the proclamation a couple of hours ago

00:31:33.900 --> 00:31:34.380
I

00:31:34.380 --> 00:31:34.760
don't

00:31:34.760 --> 00:31:35.120
know if you've

00:31:35.120 --> 00:31:45.640
heard but when the steering council comes out with an acceptance it's all me and when it's a rejection that's somebody else, you know, so it's like, I only do the final night.

00:31:46.040 --> 00:31:48.620
I'm kidding, but it's kind of fun.

00:31:50.100 --> 00:31:50.520
Go ahead, Brett.

00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:52.360
Yeah, I just think,

00:31:52.440 --> 00:32:15.400
I think, yeah, I was just thinking about back to Carol's comment about how she got to work on the early Apples, and like, I got started on Apple IIs and Apple Basic, and I remember Windows 3.1 shipping with QBasic in, and like having the Gorillaz game shipping, and oh, I can play with the gravity constant and make the bananas do crazy stuff, right?

00:32:16.519 --> 00:32:24.300
And I think we were fairly lucky, as Barry says, like the language is old, but it's hitting its prime, you could argue now,

00:32:24.940 --> 00:32:25.600
or it's perpetually

00:32:25.600 --> 00:32:28.140
always hitting more of its prime as time goes on.

00:32:28.600 --> 00:32:36.240
But I think we also were very lucky in terms of timing because I think language had a certain level of maturity when the internet hit its maturity, right?

00:32:36.400 --> 00:32:46.780
And because it was also one of these languages that's easy to pick up and get going with, we were at the right place at the right time for when, oh yeah, programming, you can get into it.

00:32:46.840 --> 00:32:50.540
And kids and other people just wanted to start trying out this whole programming thing.

00:32:50.540 --> 00:32:56.340
And it wasn't just that weird corner of the bookstore that had like five books about programming at the time.

00:32:57.080 --> 00:33:02.920
And so I think we just really lucked out with the timing here where it's like, oh yeah, you want to learn programming?

00:33:02.980 --> 00:33:04.840
Yeah, there's this thing called Python, go install it.

00:33:04.960 --> 00:33:07.400
It's got its own little editor and blah, blah, blah.

00:33:09.059 --> 00:33:15.040
before downloading an editor wasn't just called Borland or whatever.

00:33:17.840 --> 00:33:31.380
And so I think, yeah, the timing just was perfect for us to land right when we did and have the maturity level that we did in order to be useful to people but so easily accessible and to carry us forward to where we are now where it's like you still have a plethora of options.

00:33:31.560 --> 00:33:36.020
You can download a bunch of different editors whether it's PyCharm or what have you.

00:33:36.800 --> 00:33:45.300
you can get what you need, but the point is the language is still there and still available, and I think it's allowed us to continue to be very accessible to people, and that's, I think, also played into this.

00:33:47.520 --> 00:33:48.740
Hey, I have a theory of the case.

00:33:49.919 --> 00:33:52.200
Michael, do you have something you want to go with first?

00:33:52.480 --> 00:33:54.340
No, you go first, and then I've got a thought.

00:33:54.840 --> 00:33:58.060
All right, cool. I have a theory of the case that features the three of you.

00:33:58.920 --> 00:33:59.420
How convenient.

00:34:01.020 --> 00:34:06.200
So, I divide Python into three-thirds, and as I was joking backstage, Python has many thirds.

00:34:06.700 --> 00:34:08.020
Brett says we'll get to nine thirds.

00:34:09.860 --> 00:34:12.679
The first third was like Guido opens a file.

00:34:13.200 --> 00:34:15.860
I'm curious, was it Emacs?

00:34:16.760 --> 00:34:19.540
Did Guido open YOLO.C in

00:34:19.540 --> 00:34:20.020
Emacs?

00:34:20.220 --> 00:34:20.919
Yeah, yeah.

00:34:22.540 --> 00:34:23.820
Yeah, he

00:34:23.820 --> 00:34:24.840
was an Emacs user.

00:34:25.940 --> 00:34:32.020
Guido opens a file, and then I'll say the first third for me ends, we'll say 2002.

00:34:32.520 --> 00:34:32.840
Why?

00:34:33.360 --> 00:34:34.620
Dot-com bubble bursts.

00:34:35.520 --> 00:35:04.800
and so it's kind of the end of an era and it is the beginning of the PSF which started in 2001 and the end of that episode we'll refer to as the Python software activity and for me it's also personal it's when I left my company and moved to Europe now the next third, the first third is interesting because that's Barry was there at the beginning of the first third.

00:35:05.470 --> 00:35:13.320
Second third is the rise of the PSF gave the ability to have the rise of PyCon.

00:35:13.610 --> 00:35:17.960
And PyCon became this engine of change and growth and money.

00:35:19.340 --> 00:35:28.220
And I'd say the end of the second third, I'll put it at 2012, 2013, and it finishes with the rise of diversity.

00:35:29.540 --> 00:35:33.380
And I was reading up about Jesse McKellar and the years that that all went down.

00:35:33.410 --> 00:35:40.240
And it went from 1% speakers to 3% speakers to 10% speakers to 38% of the speakers were women.

00:35:41.740 --> 00:35:46.420
And she was a director 2012 to 2014.

00:35:47.720 --> 00:35:50.900
And Carol was a director in that time frame.

00:35:50.970 --> 00:35:56.500
And I think from history, she got you kind of hooked into the world of Python organizing.

00:35:56.530 --> 00:35:57.440
She absolutely

00:35:57.440 --> 00:35:58.060
did.

00:35:58.540 --> 00:36:04.760
We were both volunteering on a project, which was a nonprofit called OpenHatch.

00:36:05.190 --> 00:36:05.340
Right.

00:36:05.490 --> 00:36:06.380
That helped people

00:36:06.380 --> 00:36:11.480
make their first contributions to open source before there were guides on GitHub or anything

00:36:11.480 --> 00:36:11.760
else.

00:36:12.740 --> 00:36:21.760
And, you know, what I think people don't see with that rise is the amount of effort Jessica put in behind the scenes.

00:36:22.720 --> 00:36:23.060
Because there

00:36:23.060 --> 00:36:27.500
were a few of us one year when she was really busy that we kind of filled the gap for her.

00:36:27.940 --> 00:36:28.740
But she

00:36:28.740 --> 00:36:37.020
sent hundreds and hundreds of personal emails out to many, many people across the ecosystem.

00:36:37.400 --> 00:36:38.660
Have you thought about talking about

00:36:38.660 --> 00:36:40.020
doing

00:36:40.020 --> 00:36:41.400
a poster, doing a lightning

00:36:41.400 --> 00:36:42.280
talk, doing a

00:36:42.280 --> 00:36:42.700
blah, blah, blah.

00:36:43.120 --> 00:36:44.280
We'll help coach you.

00:36:44.640 --> 00:36:46.560
And some of it happened on the PyLadies Slack.

00:36:46.640 --> 00:36:50.400
Some of it happened on IRC with OpenHatch.

00:36:50.700 --> 00:36:53.440
And it was very intentional.

00:36:53.740 --> 00:36:59.780
And I think the thing she did was she measured the impact that she was trying to make.

00:37:00.020 --> 00:37:04.780
And I think that really, I think it gave that momentum.

00:37:05.540 --> 00:37:06.320
So I

00:37:06.320 --> 00:37:11.680
blame her for anything that I have done in Python because that's where I learned

00:37:11.680 --> 00:37:12.120
Django.

00:37:14.260 --> 00:37:19.160
But I've conveniently chosen the second, third to kick off with Brett.

00:37:20.600 --> 00:37:25.720
So around 2002, 2003 was when you started entering the scene and you

00:37:25.720 --> 00:37:26.000
got

00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:26.400
involved

00:37:26.400 --> 00:37:27.320
in the PSF.

00:37:27.820 --> 00:37:32.780
And I'd say that the finishing with the diversity in that third, it wasn't just gender diversity.

00:37:33.040 --> 00:37:40.140
Python became a globally diverse outfit with things like PyLadies Drive and stuff like that.

00:37:40.360 --> 00:37:45.380
And then that became the engine for the third third, which was data science and then AI.

00:37:46.420 --> 00:37:46.800
Before we

00:37:46.800 --> 00:37:47.100
go into

00:37:47.100 --> 00:37:47.240
your

00:37:47.240 --> 00:37:54.040
third third, I think the second third also, it should be pointed out, the diversity technically as well.

00:37:56.120 --> 00:38:00.220
Because Jake Vander Plaats gave a great Python as a Mosaic keynote.

00:38:00.720 --> 00:38:01.960
Let's get that in the show notes.

00:38:02.580 --> 00:38:06.040
Yeah, people are coming from all different places, you know, data science.

00:38:06.350 --> 00:38:07.580
Also, it brought in a bunch of scientists

00:38:07.580 --> 00:38:07.980
and just,

00:38:08.040 --> 00:38:10.520
you know, programmer curious people.

00:38:11.060 --> 00:38:13.160
You wouldn't get that at like a C++ conference,

00:38:13.850 --> 00:38:14.060
you know.

00:38:14.320 --> 00:38:18.580
And I think that happened as part of the 2012 revolution and stuff.

00:38:19.400 --> 00:38:19.880
So

00:38:19.880 --> 00:38:27.240
if we say 2013, 2014, 2015 is the start of the next third and the start of data science, and then Jupyter

00:38:27.240 --> 00:38:28.040
arrives on

00:38:28.040 --> 00:38:37.120
the scene as this great democratizing force, Carol becomes PSF board director, and then things just really take off from there.

00:38:37.140 --> 00:38:45.740
And it kind of needed the diversity from the second third to be the engine to bring in this group of people called data scientists who didn't think they were programmers.

00:38:46.280 --> 00:38:49.720
So it's an entire new class of Python community.

00:38:50.560 --> 00:38:51.160
Hey, what do you think?

00:38:51.160 --> 00:38:52.700
Did the three of you buy my thirds?

00:38:55.260 --> 00:38:55.440
Yeah.

00:38:57.520 --> 00:38:59.260
I'm curious what the

00:38:59.260 --> 00:39:00.740
next third is going to be.

00:39:01.980 --> 00:39:02.180
Yeah.

00:39:02.720 --> 00:39:04.800
What's the fourth third going to be there, Paul?

00:39:05.040 --> 00:39:10.060
You know, in reading about Jessica, she got into Python because it twisted.

00:39:10.410 --> 00:39:13.680
And it just turns out Glyph wrote a blog post today AI.

00:39:15.810 --> 00:39:20.340
And so AI

00:39:20.340 --> 00:39:21.260
and Python

00:39:21.260 --> 00:39:23.140
are interesting

00:39:23.140 --> 00:39:28.620
and contradictory, complimentary frenemy. I don't know. You call it.

00:39:30.390 --> 00:39:30.800
Too early.

00:39:31.390 --> 00:39:32.720
Too early. I think

00:39:32.720 --> 00:39:36.580
it's one of those things. I've seen lots of paradigm shifts in tech.

00:39:36.580 --> 00:39:37.320
And I talked about

00:39:37.320 --> 00:39:42.940
this when I keynoted Europe Python, but I think AI is here to stay. Now,

00:39:43.320 --> 00:39:43.540
granted,

00:39:43.740 --> 00:40:18.220
AI was also here when I was in grad school in 1988. So, you know, but we never had the compute power that we have today. So I think I'm sort of in the camp of there's bad and there's good. And what we're, which is the same thing when the internet sort of, and the web sort of started, there was those feelings of bad and good. And over time, you kind of settle into, okay, what are these innovative ways we can use it that don't cause harm?

00:40:19.380 --> 00:40:20.600
And, you know,

00:40:20.920 --> 00:40:34.960
how do people benefit? Because I think it is a pretty good brainstorming partner. Would I want to give it all of my security credentials and say, go deploy this application for me? No, not

00:40:34.960 --> 00:40:35.720
today. Maybe

00:40:35.720 --> 00:40:36.240
not ever.

00:40:37.160 --> 00:40:54.040
But I think there's going to be exciting stuff to come out of it. I think it's going to be that tension between, hey, this is great, or, oh, what about maybe not so much. And that will finally propel us forward to better things. So stay tuned for the

00:40:54.040 --> 00:41:24.460
next third. Totally. And people forget, or they maybe never knew, there was a time in the internet where people would not put their credit card on to buy stuff because they were freaked out about it and now i can hardly find stuff at a store i have to buy it on online because it's the only place it exists anymore and there was super bowl ads with just weird dot coms just burning money just with no business model whatsoever like unlike even unlike today. It was just completely crazy.

00:41:25.160 --> 00:41:26.120
Monkeys dancing.

00:41:26.670 --> 00:41:32.300
I read today Pets.com did their IPO and went out of business nine months later.

00:41:32.940 --> 00:41:33.180
Yep.

00:41:35.340 --> 00:41:37.300
I remember when Java had Super Bowl ads.

00:41:40.320 --> 00:41:40.700
Oh, wow.

00:41:41.440 --> 00:41:43.100
I think IBM did one.

00:41:43.720 --> 00:41:44.400
Of course

00:41:44.400 --> 00:41:45.120
it would be IBM.

00:41:45.900 --> 00:41:46.140
Yep.

00:41:46.800 --> 00:41:55.560
I very distinctly remember they had an ad where they had a big sphere in the middle of a conference room table with a dot and dot com.

00:41:55.600 --> 00:42:04.640
It's like somehow like activated and like blew all the people back in their chairs from the table. It was a wild time.

00:42:09.060 --> 00:42:10.540
Michael, you got muted somehow.

00:42:11.900 --> 00:42:12.280
Can you hear me?

00:42:12.900 --> 00:42:13.700
Now we can hear you.

00:42:14.040 --> 00:42:18.560
My computer is completely locked up but I'm just going to keep going for now.

00:42:18.560 --> 00:42:19.860
I'll find a way to get back into it.

00:42:20.840 --> 00:42:21.240
Completely

00:42:21.240 --> 00:42:24.060
restarted is probably not a great idea right now.

00:42:25.820 --> 00:42:26.200
Speaking of

00:42:26.200 --> 00:42:26.360
locked

00:42:26.360 --> 00:42:27.760
up, I wonder what's going to happen

00:42:29.020 --> 00:42:33.380
with all these LLMs when you tell them to generate Python code that runs in free threads.

00:42:34.580 --> 00:42:36.060
Yes. Oh, this is

00:42:36.060 --> 00:42:36.720
not a history.

00:42:36.860 --> 00:42:37.960
This is the future. The last three words

00:42:37.960 --> 00:42:38.640
of every prompt.

00:42:40.160 --> 00:42:58.020
It's going to be interesting. I think that's the crazy thing about all this. It's not only is Python being used to help derive this AI stuff, but the AI is also being used to generate Python code and actually it's a benchmark now for these things, which also plays into the whole, how does Python keep going forward and keep reaching its prime?

00:42:58.200 --> 00:43:01.360
Will you have the new tech actually literally make it for you now?

00:43:03.600 --> 00:43:12.680
But yeah, it's going to be interesting, and I think this is going to be a good example of how this tech is going to keep up, but we also don't need to go down the AI rabbit hole.

00:43:13.560 --> 00:43:25.720
The thing that makes me confident and excited and exhilarated It is the stuff Carol's doing and Sarah Boyce and other people where in order to stay healthy, Python's a hundred year project at this point.

00:43:25.880 --> 00:43:28.060
Python's going to be around for a long damn time.

00:43:28.600 --> 00:43:32.020
And so you need the next generation and the generation after that.

00:43:32.839 --> 00:43:39.440
And Barry and I mean, there are multiple generations of heroes after us represented in this call.

00:43:39.590 --> 00:43:41.980
And then Carol's help raising the next generation.

00:43:42.150 --> 00:43:43.980
I meet some of these people at PyCon.

00:43:44.780 --> 00:43:46.440
Obviously Dawn, but then meeting

00:43:46.440 --> 00:43:47.060
Velda

00:43:47.060 --> 00:43:49.280
and Abigail and some of these other people.

00:43:50.080 --> 00:43:54.300
And my goodness, you can just see, wow, there's some energy here.

00:43:56.440 --> 00:44:02.120
You know, I think it all goes back to the start and things propagate out.

00:44:02.560 --> 00:44:10.160
And I think Python, much like a network or a web, you know, has really exploded in all different directions.

00:44:11.420 --> 00:44:21.940
And, you know, I think some of the work that Barry has been doing with packaging, I have a lot of strong feelings that that's going to make it propagate out even more.

00:44:22.880 --> 00:44:23.100
So.

00:44:25.920 --> 00:44:35.120
Well, I think and apologies because my network decided to do was going to be super flaky.

00:44:35.340 --> 00:44:37.240
So I've missed a bunch of the conversation.

00:44:37.740 --> 00:44:50.520
But what I think is super important is that those new generations, those younger generations that are coming into Python are going to make Python part of their vision.

00:44:51.200 --> 00:45:06.300
What Python is today, what myself and Brad and Paul, our generation made Python to solve the problems that we had and to be part of our vision.

00:45:06.700 --> 00:45:15.320
And if nothing else is true, five years from now, two years from now, Python will be something else.

00:45:15.820 --> 00:45:22.160
And there will be other people coming in making Python what they envision it to be.

00:45:23.320 --> 00:45:26.260
And I think that's actually what keeps it alive and keeps it vibrant.

00:45:26.440 --> 00:45:27.920
Like you said, Paul, it's a 100-year project.

00:45:28.200 --> 00:45:35.020
And, you know, regeneration is going to come into Python and say, and it's always been that way.

00:45:35.120 --> 00:45:36.860
It's always been a grassroots thing.

00:45:37.400 --> 00:45:40.060
Like you think about like async, right?

00:45:40.400 --> 00:45:41.880
First, we just needed yield.

00:45:42.870 --> 00:45:46.160
And then we needed sort of, you know, co-routines.

00:45:46.250 --> 00:45:47.660
And then those became async.

00:45:47.840 --> 00:45:51.500
And so like that didn't come from the top.

00:45:51.630 --> 00:45:56.820
It didn't come from somebody who sort of said, I see what Python is today.

00:45:57.030 --> 00:46:00.780
And we could just do this little thing and move it in that direction.

00:46:00.950 --> 00:46:01.820
And it would be really cool.

00:46:02.280 --> 00:46:04.880
And that's what keeps it alive.

00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:06.960
So I'm super

00:46:06.960 --> 00:46:07.600
excited to

00:46:07.600 --> 00:46:09.580
see what, you know, the next generation.

00:46:10.540 --> 00:46:10.860
Yeah, go ahead.

00:46:11.480 --> 00:46:12.200
I'm as well.

00:46:12.220 --> 00:46:25.740
And I think those kinds of things you're pointing out, Barry, I think it's the choice of do I give up on working here in this community, in this language, and go to another technology because I need something else somewhere else?

00:46:26.180 --> 00:46:31.360
Or do I somehow add it to Python so that I can stay here and keep building with this language, right?

00:46:31.360 --> 00:46:32.740
And I think that's really nice.

00:46:33.360 --> 00:46:33.740
Keeps it up.

00:46:34.440 --> 00:46:40.240
I think this is a key point that I think some people miss is to why do we keep evolving the language?

00:46:40.580 --> 00:46:43.260
Why can't we be nice and stable like some of the languages?

00:46:43.590 --> 00:46:44.920
At least that's how some people like to phrase it.

00:46:45.660 --> 00:46:50.160
Why aren't we more of a Go or more of a Java where we evolve slower or make fewer changes?

00:46:50.670 --> 00:46:55.560
Well, our flexibility in moving with the times has, I think, helped keep us relevant.

00:46:56.490 --> 00:46:56.880
And that's

00:46:56.880 --> 00:47:05.760
why we have this baked into the community of, no, we all evolve, we all grow, We'll continue to learn new things and language goes along with it.

00:47:06.960 --> 00:47:07.160
Absolutely.

00:47:07.360 --> 00:47:07.560
Gary,

00:47:07.580 --> 00:47:09.180
I think Larry Wall has a quote.

00:47:09.260 --> 00:47:12.940
Pearl is unreadable and ugly because people wanted it that way.

00:47:16.780 --> 00:47:18.300
I call it a write-only language.

00:47:18.980 --> 00:47:19.140
Yeah.

00:47:21.800 --> 00:47:23.020
I'm there with you on that one.

00:47:24.080 --> 00:47:25.020
So let's talk.

00:47:25.140 --> 00:47:25.660
I got a phone.

00:47:25.720 --> 00:47:31.020
Let's talk the Xenipython here because I think that that comes up a lot.

00:47:31.280 --> 00:47:47.140
mentioned import this. And if you're in a REPL and you type import this, then you get the Xenopython by Tim Peters. We also have someone in the audience who's musically inclined and has done something pretty awesome with us.

00:47:47.770 --> 00:47:49.140
So somebody

00:47:49.140 --> 00:47:49.540
tell us

00:47:49.540 --> 00:47:50.320
the story of

00:47:50.320 --> 00:47:57.960
import this and the Xenopython, and then I'll play a little song, a song version of it for everyone that Barry did.

00:48:00.840 --> 00:48:37.740
yeah there there are definitely uh blog posts i think quito did one and i did one about how this came to be i think we were looking i can't remember what year it was but we were looking for a motto or you know cat phrase for a pycon at one point or yeah i think it was a pycon and so we actually solicited input from community And I think we literally got 500 entries, 98% of which were just terrible.

00:48:39.270 --> 00:48:43.200
But we had no way of choosing from that list.

00:48:43.460 --> 00:48:45.240
And I remember Tim Peters.

00:48:45.390 --> 00:48:48.080
So this had to be Python Labs time frame.

00:48:49.040 --> 00:48:51.400
But Tim Peters said, okay, here's what we're going to do.

00:48:52.960 --> 00:48:56.300
I'll split it in half, and then I'll go on to somebody else.

00:48:56.740 --> 00:49:00.700
And then you split it in half and pass it on to somebody else.

00:49:00.710 --> 00:49:05.000
And I think Tim and I were the only ones left that actually wanted to participate.

00:49:05.440 --> 00:49:09.600
And we got down to the last couple.

00:49:10.940 --> 00:49:17.000
And Import This had gotten pretty far down, but it wasn't one of the last choices.

00:49:17.170 --> 00:49:21.000
And when we ended up with the last choice, we said, oh, that's really bad.

00:49:21.170 --> 00:49:22.520
We're going with Import This.

00:49:24.560 --> 00:49:27.640
So that's how the import this thing.

00:49:27.780 --> 00:49:31.580
And then, of course, once we came up with that, we're like, oh, well, we've got to add this module.

00:49:32.160 --> 00:49:33.860
What's the this module going to print?

00:49:34.240 --> 00:49:34.960
You know, we actually

00:49:34.960 --> 00:49:35.600
import

00:49:35.600 --> 00:49:35.740
it.

00:49:35.740 --> 00:49:38.460
And so we had to come up with the Xenopython.

00:49:39.080 --> 00:49:41.820
But we had to obfuscate it just a little bit.

00:49:41.860 --> 00:49:42.720
So it was rot13.

00:49:44.740 --> 00:49:51.240
And I think we actually may have turned off subversion notifications.

00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:54.160
And then because we wanted it to be an Easter egg.

00:49:54.700 --> 00:50:04.800
So we committed it and didn't notify anybody and then turned it back on and just waited to see who would, you know, when somebody would find it.

00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:08.140
So that was kind of the story of this.

00:50:09.320 --> 00:50:09.940
That's incredible.

00:50:11.080 --> 00:50:12.160
All right, Barry, can we play your song?

00:50:16.920 --> 00:50:17.720
Drum roll, please.

00:50:18.480 --> 00:50:19.700
Yeah, Barry, can we play your song?

00:50:19.760 --> 00:50:20.300
Yeah, let's do it.

00:50:20.700 --> 00:50:21.340
I love it.

00:50:21.560 --> 00:50:22.120
Here we go.

00:50:22.380 --> 00:50:23.200
Yeah, go for it.

00:50:23.760 --> 00:50:25.720
Yeah, it's got a moment of silence at the beginning.

00:50:25.820 --> 00:50:27.760
It's not like things frozen up.

00:50:27.900 --> 00:50:28.100
It's just.

00:51:01.980 --> 00:51:28.900
Beautiful is better than ugly Explicit is better than implicit Simple is better than complex Complex is better than complicated Flat is better than nested Sparse is better than dense Readability counts.

00:51:33.500 --> 00:51:34.700
Special cases

00:51:34.700 --> 00:51:38.000
aren't special enough to break the rules.

00:51:40.180 --> 00:51:43.800
Although practicality beats purity.

00:51:47.700 --> 00:51:49.920
Errors should never pass silently.

00:51:50.900 --> 00:51:55.480
Unless explicitly silenced in the face of ambiguity.

00:51:56.960 --> 00:52:07.320
Confuse the temptation to guess There should be one Preferably only one Obvious way

00:52:07.320 --> 00:52:33.620
to do it Although that way Will not be obvious at first Unless you're Dutch Now is better than ever Although never is often better than

00:52:33.620 --> 00:52:59.160
writing now If the implementation is hard to explain It's a bad idea If the implementation is easy to explain It may be a

00:52:59.160 --> 00:53:13.500
good idea Namespaces are one Honking great idea Let's do more of those

00:53:17.220 --> 00:53:18.800
Well done, man.

00:53:19.520 --> 00:53:19.960
Very nice.

00:53:20.540 --> 00:53:21.100
I love it.

00:53:21.560 --> 00:53:22.640
That was awesome.

00:53:23.380 --> 00:53:24.460
That's really good.

00:53:25.100 --> 00:53:25.160
You

00:53:25.160 --> 00:53:27.740
know, it reminds me of

00:53:27.740 --> 00:53:34.320
the band Tribe, who played this song called Super Collider, about the Super Collider that's being built in Texas out in the 90s.

00:53:34.980 --> 00:53:35.860
I love that song.

00:53:36.110 --> 00:53:36.200
It

00:53:36.200 --> 00:53:36.820
brings me to my heart.

00:53:38.140 --> 00:53:39.040
I'll have to check that out.

00:53:39.280 --> 00:53:39.940
Well, thank you.

00:53:40.700 --> 00:53:40.800
Did

00:53:40.800 --> 00:53:41.240
you do the vocals?

00:53:41.240 --> 00:53:42.600
That was supposed to be done for...

00:53:42.600 --> 00:53:43.300
So the idea...

00:53:45.140 --> 00:53:47.260
Yeah, I did do the vocals.

00:53:47.820 --> 00:53:48.240
They were good?

00:53:48.440 --> 00:53:49.060
Yes, I did.

00:53:49.130 --> 00:53:49.260
They

00:53:49.260 --> 00:53:49.840
were good.

00:53:50.680 --> 00:53:51.480
Well, thanks.

00:53:53.360 --> 00:54:27.320
I did the whole thing in my little studio I have my liner notes up on my web page but you know we were supposed to very musically inclined Pythonistas and so the idea was we were going to produce a record like an actual vinyl for PyLadies and so we all kind of went off on our own and worked on stuff and I agreed to do it and had promptly forgotten about it until I think like 10 days before it was due.

00:54:28.440 --> 00:54:33.840
So then, you know, scrambled and, you know, stole Tim's Zen of Python for the lyrics.

00:54:34.220 --> 00:54:36.740
And of course, that was the year of the pandemic.

00:54:37.140 --> 00:54:39.140
So there was no PyLadies.

00:54:39.160 --> 00:54:42.520
And we were all so sad because I thought it was going to be a really cool.

00:54:42.620 --> 00:54:46.520
I mean, everyone came up with some really great music for it.

00:54:46.720 --> 00:54:47.480
So anyway.

00:54:49.200 --> 00:54:49.960
That was good.

00:54:50.440 --> 00:54:51.480
We'll put it out on the podcast.

00:54:51.650 --> 00:54:52.040
How about that?

00:54:52.360 --> 00:54:54.380
It'll get out there in the world one way or another.

00:54:55.260 --> 00:54:55.740
Thank you.

00:54:55.800 --> 00:54:57.140
We're getting short on time here.

00:54:57.260 --> 00:55:04.240
We're coming up, honestly, if we all had the time and maybe some snacks and a beer or something or coffee, we could do

00:55:04.240 --> 00:55:04.700
this for hours.

00:55:07.180 --> 00:55:11.280
But we are getting in probably the time where we should wrap it up a bit.

00:55:11.700 --> 00:55:17.260
I think we would be remiss if we didn't talk about Python 2 to 3.

00:55:17.790 --> 00:55:18.300
What are you guys saying?

00:55:19.820 --> 00:55:23.440
It was a tough story for a time, but I think it's in the past.

00:55:23.540 --> 00:55:25.360
I think we're all good.

00:55:25.560 --> 00:55:27.580
Everyone's rowing in the same direction.

00:55:27.880 --> 00:55:36.620
But I think just as an important historical note in the evolution of Python, that was one of the bigger challenges it turned out to be.

00:55:36.860 --> 00:55:38.420
Who wants to riff on this?

00:55:38.440 --> 00:55:44.060
Well, you know, I think we actually, maybe we did it a little late, but like we couldn't do it

00:55:44.060 --> 00:55:44.400
today.

00:55:44.800 --> 00:55:46.940
There's just too much Python code out there today.

00:55:47.240 --> 00:55:53.220
So in a sense, I think we did it at just the right time, as painful as it was and as long as it took.

00:55:54.600 --> 00:56:02.280
I'm certainly super glad that we did because, you know, we got rid of a lot of warts and we really improved the implementation, the language.

00:56:05.060 --> 00:56:06.720
But we had to do it.

00:56:07.040 --> 00:56:11.300
And if we had done it any later, you know, I don't think Python would be what it is today.

00:56:12.140 --> 00:56:13.820
It would be impossible to do it today.

00:56:14.300 --> 00:56:16.220
So, yeah.

00:56:18.280 --> 00:56:21.060
Mostly, I think, in hindsight, we can now say it was a success.

00:56:22.880 --> 00:56:23.280
But...

00:56:23.940 --> 00:56:31.800
You know, I was, especially on my other podcast, Python Bytes, I really tried to carry the water for it.

00:56:31.840 --> 00:56:34.440
I referred to Python 2 as Legacy Python for years.

00:56:35.280 --> 00:56:37.000
So much so, people gave me bad comments

00:56:37.000 --> 00:56:37.400
about it.

00:56:37.400 --> 00:56:37.940
I'm like, I don't care.

00:56:37.960 --> 00:56:38.620
I'm still doing it.

00:56:39.200 --> 00:56:40.820
They're like, don't make me feel bad about it working in.

00:56:41.000 --> 00:56:46.020
I understand what you're saying, but let's all get together and let's just get this forward.

00:56:46.220 --> 00:56:46.720
Go forward.

00:56:47.180 --> 00:56:47.360
Come on.

00:56:48.300 --> 00:56:52.140
Harry's words are also slightly colored as the release measure for Python 3.0.

00:56:52.240 --> 00:56:53.220
So take everything you

00:56:53.220 --> 00:56:53.600
just said.

00:56:55.740 --> 00:56:56.540
Oh, yeah.

00:56:56.860 --> 00:56:58.540
And 2.5, I think.

00:56:59.240 --> 00:57:00.520
Or 2.6, I don't remember.

00:57:00.600 --> 00:57:01.880
But we did them at the same time.

00:57:01.940 --> 00:57:04.780
And then we told people, don't use Python 3.0.

00:57:04.880 --> 00:57:10.340
We were like, I think that was the shortest length of time before the next release.

00:57:11.720 --> 00:57:11.880
six

00:57:11.880 --> 00:57:14.300
months for yeah

00:57:14.300 --> 00:57:18.080
six months i feel worse for benjamin peterson because

00:57:19.160 --> 00:57:19.760
he

00:57:19.760 --> 00:57:36.500
showed up my gosh he you know he showed up on the scene and online he was like so smart and you know you know communicated really well and then he showed up at pycon in chicago i think he was 15 and his mom had to drive him to the to the

00:57:36.500 --> 00:57:37.340
conference

00:57:37.340 --> 00:57:50.280
and we gave him python 2 7 not knowing that he didn't have to do it for 10 years so uh but he did it great he was like he was absolutely a superstar for that

00:57:50.280 --> 00:57:52.420
yeah um

00:57:52.420 --> 00:57:53.220
i

00:57:53.220 --> 00:58:19.000
think one of the interesting things of two to three is you know probably like 2012, I started seeing scientific Python and, you know, I was working on Django and scientific Python. And the more I started working with it, the harder it was because if you're trying to teach it to somebody, you had to do it. Well, if you use three, you do this.

00:58:19.140 --> 00:58:26.740
And if you use two, you can do this. And Oh, by the way, if you're using windows with three or, And it became just

00:58:26.740 --> 00:58:27.960
super complex

00:58:27.960 --> 00:58:29.680
as an instructor.

00:58:30.640 --> 00:58:50.520
And then I think it was around the latest part of 2014, the scientific Python community sort of put a stake in the ground and said, we are moving to Python 3 exclusively and kind of had a deprecation of we will no longer support 2.

00:58:51.580 --> 00:58:52.560
And I think that,

00:58:53.500 --> 00:59:05.860
I think, was a catalyst plus the growth of the whole scientific and data science ecosystem and notebooks and things like that kind of pushed us up.

00:59:05.870 --> 00:59:13.620
But I know Brett, I think, was the one that made the tracker of how many Python packages still are.

00:59:14.300 --> 00:59:15.060
Or the top

00:59:15.060 --> 00:59:15.760
300

00:59:15.760 --> 00:59:16.680
or something.

00:59:16.860 --> 00:59:18.200
Was it you or was it somebody else?

00:59:18.940 --> 00:59:19.620
It was somebody else.

00:59:19.820 --> 00:59:23.940
I didn't do the website, but I wrote, can I use Python 3, the tool

00:59:23.940 --> 00:59:26.300
you could use to do the calculation

00:59:26.300 --> 00:59:27.220
that it used behind the scenes.

00:59:27.310 --> 00:59:27.980
I didn't do the website.

00:59:28.650 --> 00:59:28.740
Yeah.

00:59:29.290 --> 00:59:29.640
But that

00:59:29.640 --> 00:59:30.300
was super

00:59:30.300 --> 00:59:38.480
helpful because, you know, you'd get up on talks and say, okay, we used to be here, and now we're almost got it completely green.

00:59:40.019 --> 00:59:40.380
Yeah,

00:59:40.680 --> 00:59:42.100
I mean, you know.

00:59:42.660 --> 00:59:43.800
Sorry, I didn't mean to cut you off, Carl.

00:59:43.980 --> 00:59:44.320
No, no, no.

00:59:44.460 --> 00:59:44.720
Go ahead.

00:59:45.460 --> 00:59:58.100
Yeah, I mean, I'll say I had a similar kind of educational rough spot with 2 to 3 as well because while I was doing my PhD at University of British Columbia, they were also looking at changing their intro language.

00:59:59.040 --> 01:00:01.200
And they're considering Python, but it was during the transition.

01:00:01.780 --> 01:00:03.200
So they didn't know, should we be

01:00:03.200 --> 01:00:04.300
teaching Python 2, should we

01:00:04.300 --> 01:00:05.240
be teaching Python 3?

01:00:05.540 --> 01:00:09.380
Well, we don't want to teach the old stuff, but the new stuff's coming, but the new stuff was still a little too rough.

01:00:09.980 --> 01:00:10.600
So they went to racket.

01:00:12.279 --> 01:00:13.900
So we missed out on that one.

01:00:14.940 --> 01:00:17.080
I agree with Barry. I think it was worth it, right?

01:00:17.720 --> 01:00:21.840
I think switching to Unicode and all that was the right call.

01:00:21.960 --> 01:00:46.020
I think that's definitely helped probably with our international reach and allowing people internationally to use the language in a better way and allowing people to use Unicode in their variable names, right? That's a Python 3 thing. You can just do that innately without having to declare the little coding cookie, which I'm willing to do. Most people don't know what is anymore because you don't care because it's all just UTF ain't now. If you're not laughing now, I can

01:00:46.020 --> 01:00:46.220
tell

01:00:46.220 --> 01:00:47.900
you're too young to know what the heck I'm talking about.

01:00:49.100 --> 01:00:53.320
The other thing too is also we're also going to meet core devs who never used Python 2.

01:00:53.600 --> 01:00:54.740
They don't know what the heck it is.

01:00:55.420 --> 01:00:56.020
They're literally people

01:00:56.020 --> 01:00:56.640
who are joining us

01:00:56.640 --> 01:01:08.880
like, I've never written Python 2 in my life. I just know it's a thing. They hear stories and whispers in the back dark corners of conferences of what the transition was like. I don't know what you're talking about. I never used Python 2.

01:01:08.920 --> 01:01:22.700
I jumped straight to 3 when I started and either they knew 2 existed but didn't worry about it before EOL'd or they didn't use Python until after Python 2 reached the end of its life in 2020 and they just don't know what the heck we're talking about.

01:01:23.200 --> 01:01:23.360
So

01:01:23.360 --> 01:01:24.700
it was rough.

01:01:24.740 --> 01:01:27.020
For me, I have a different perspective.

01:01:27.960 --> 01:01:36.500
Python 3000 started right at the moment that my company's project was killing itself in a 2 to 3 transition.

01:01:36.670 --> 01:01:38.640
And so I hear about horror stories.

01:01:38.710 --> 01:01:40.320
I'm like, you call that a horror story?

01:01:40.380 --> 01:01:40.700
story.

01:01:41.240 --> 01:01:41.640
Come on.

01:01:44.580 --> 01:01:45.980
If you live in the uphill

01:01:46.800 --> 01:01:49.140
both ways to school, it was below zero.

01:01:50.060 --> 01:01:50.580
Right,

01:01:50.760 --> 01:01:51.000
exactly.

01:01:52.160 --> 01:01:52.800
I had to write

01:01:52.800 --> 01:01:55.660
two different ways in the same code base.

01:01:56.740 --> 01:01:57.200
Yeah.

01:01:58.460 --> 01:01:59.040
I have

01:01:59.040 --> 01:01:59.680
a container.

01:02:02.380 --> 01:02:27.980
There's another thing that's kind of funny because I have a slide deck that I've given this talk a few times and it goes through like the python i think it starts at like 096 or 098 or something like that and i downloaded every tarball i could find couldn't build a single one on a modern system without changes uh but i dug out all the change logs and news files and things like that

01:02:27.980 --> 01:02:28.880
and all

01:02:28.880 --> 01:02:50.220
the announcements and you find such really super interesting nuggets in there like you know guido just changed operators you know the quality and comparison operator and just said, fix your code, you know, no backwards compatibility, no from, from future thing. Just like, you know, plus I, I've changed a bunch of other things. It's up to you to figure it out.

01:02:50.310 --> 01:03:06.260
So like, you know, those are things that we could get away with, you know, way back then, or Guido could at least that, you know, you can't get away with that stuff today. You got to think about, you know, it's going to take five years for this to get through the community and there's backwards compatibility and we can't deprecate this thing. So.

01:03:07.400 --> 01:03:19.800
Carol, on Barry's point about timing, is it safe to say that when IPython notebooks were really ramping up around 2016, 2017, that they were all Python 3 by then, that that whole audience?

01:03:26.560 --> 01:03:27.200
Sort of.

01:03:28.580 --> 01:03:38.680
I think the code base was, but I think the kernels, there was still a language kernel for two and a language kernel for three.

01:03:39.840 --> 01:03:42.920
And I think it was shortly after that that we dropped the two

01:03:42.920 --> 01:03:43.480
kernel.

01:03:44.580 --> 01:03:48.300
There was a transition period, and I'm not quite sure on the dates now.

01:03:48.620 --> 01:03:48.980
But, I

01:03:48.980 --> 01:04:07.920
mean, that was where the benefit of JupyterHub and later Binder came in because we could kind of easily push out three to students and research institutions and not have to deal with two at all because they didn't need to set up their own environment.

01:04:09.940 --> 01:04:12.860
Speaking of backwards compatibility, I'm a four-letter word for you all.

01:04:13.560 --> 01:04:13.640
Cool.

01:04:16.820 --> 01:04:18.280
Oh, that's painful.

01:04:21.480 --> 01:04:22.680
For those of you who don't know

01:04:22.680 --> 01:04:23.120
the story,

01:04:23.440 --> 01:04:28.040
we'll edit keywords in a bug fix release.

01:04:29.720 --> 01:04:30.340
2-2-1.

01:04:31.440 --> 01:04:31.600
Yeah.

01:04:32.740 --> 01:04:33.300
basically

01:04:33.300 --> 01:04:33.860
Guido

01:04:33.860 --> 01:04:43.720
went how hard can it be who's using true and false with capital letters as their constants anywhere it'll be fine and so in a bug fix release we made a keyword

01:04:44.580 --> 01:04:45.460
and obviously

01:04:45.460 --> 01:04:46.760
the world kind of blew up a bit

01:04:48.579 --> 01:04:49.140
no

01:04:49.140 --> 01:04:53.380
I was assigning true to one and false to zero and yeah

01:04:55.359 --> 01:04:57.720
Michael's going to start flicking the I think it was made a keyword

01:04:57.720 --> 01:04:58.880
in 2-3

01:05:03.880 --> 01:05:13.020
it was two to three i think we were adding it to what was to become two to three and said i will just backboard it as uh symbols in in built-ins um

01:05:13.020 --> 01:05:15.080
literally true

01:05:15.080 --> 01:05:22.120
equals one and false equals zero and it was like man that'll be fine uh yeah that wasn't fine

01:05:22.120 --> 01:05:23.980
but it was an important lesson.

01:05:24.900 --> 01:05:26.660
We all learned an important lesson.

01:05:30.560 --> 01:05:31.180
How to break

01:05:31.180 --> 01:05:31.680
all the software

01:05:31.790 --> 01:05:32.200
in the world.

01:05:34.440 --> 01:05:34.880
I'm glad we're

01:05:34.880 --> 01:05:35.600
on the other side though.

01:05:35.720 --> 01:05:39.600
We all did learn lessons from the two to three transition that we will never repeat ever again.

01:05:39.840 --> 01:05:40.240
Sure.

01:05:45.100 --> 01:05:46.740
We'll do the big rewrite.

01:05:47.880 --> 01:05:48.100
Oops.

01:05:50.340 --> 01:05:50.980
Yeah, that's called free

01:05:50.980 --> 01:05:51.720
threading, Michael.

01:05:52.440 --> 01:05:52.620
Yes.

01:05:54.060 --> 01:05:56.480
exactly we'll throw a did in at the same

01:05:56.480 --> 01:05:59.760
time because we like challenges right just

01:05:59.760 --> 01:06:00.320
keep us on our

01:06:00.320 --> 01:06:00.840
toes we

01:06:00.840 --> 01:06:04.840
were feeling too comfortable we could go on vacation you know stuff like that I

01:06:04.840 --> 01:06:05.060
see

01:06:07.100 --> 01:06:07.500
no

01:06:07.500 --> 01:06:07.960
it's amazing

01:06:08.270 --> 01:06:08.560
I think

01:06:08.560 --> 01:06:25.180
the progress is really really good let's wrap it up here just so because otherwise we will make it hours and hours which I think would be fun but respect for all your time let's maybe just a final thought I'll let Paul go first this time.

01:06:25.320 --> 01:06:25.600
How's that?

01:06:28.280 --> 01:06:48.200
As this rollicking episode showed, episode one of 100 in the series, Python is full of great software, but it's also full of great stories and great people, different timelines and periods, and it's going to keep going on forever.

01:06:48.880 --> 01:06:50.400
You be one of those stories.

01:06:50.460 --> 01:06:52.940
If you're sitting out there listening, get involved.

01:06:53.200 --> 01:06:57.720
It's the most joyful thing you could ever do to start participating.

01:06:58.160 --> 01:07:04.060
And then after a few years, you find that you're someone like Carol, who's raising up the next group.

01:07:05.640 --> 01:07:06.200
Get involved.

01:07:06.480 --> 01:07:06.760
It'll be

01:07:06.760 --> 01:07:07.720
the best thing you ever did.

01:07:08.300 --> 01:07:09.000
Yeah, great advice.

01:07:09.120 --> 01:07:10.940
You start nervous and feeling out of place.

01:07:10.980 --> 01:07:12.660
And then all of a sudden, people are looking up to you.

01:07:12.840 --> 01:07:13.440
Like, how'd that happen?

01:07:14.040 --> 01:07:14.120
Yeah.

01:07:15.960 --> 01:07:19.040
All right, Carol, I feel like that's a perfect pass over to you.

01:07:19.480 --> 01:07:22.720
Yeah, it was like everything that was in my head just went out of my head.

01:07:22.980 --> 01:07:23.040
So

01:07:23.040 --> 01:07:23.760
thank you, Paul.

01:07:24.400 --> 01:07:24.940
Good job, Paul.

01:07:25.020 --> 01:07:25.540
Yeah, good job.

01:07:25.920 --> 01:07:47.320
So I think the biggest thing that I would like to say is, you know, express my gratitude to Guido for having the inspiration to begin a language and everybody else who has participated in creating it, involving it, using it.

01:07:49.640 --> 01:07:55.960
It's really, truly changed how people learn around the world and how they do research.

01:07:57.170 --> 01:07:59.520
And that's incredibly rewarding to see.

01:08:00.340 --> 01:08:11.160
And if I'm going to shill something for the next generation, there are people like Mariota and others that are really working hard on PyLadiesCon.

01:08:12.640 --> 01:08:17.180
You know, I was fortunate enough to sponsor the first two and I will again the third.

01:08:17.900 --> 01:08:22.020
But I highly encourage other people, sponsor, attend.

01:08:22.770 --> 01:08:28.180
It really is fantastic content and really lets you see how it's being used globally.

01:08:31.040 --> 01:08:33.540
And thank you, Michael, for having all of us.

01:08:33.940 --> 01:08:35.040
Oh, yeah, you're very welcome.

01:08:35.480 --> 01:08:36.000
It's my pleasure.

01:08:36.540 --> 01:08:36.700
Barry.

01:08:37.040 --> 01:08:37.640
Absolutely.

01:08:38.220 --> 01:08:38.339
Yeah.

01:08:40.740 --> 01:08:44.100
I would say, A, always have fun.

01:08:45.580 --> 01:08:46.779
C, always be curious.

01:08:48.720 --> 01:08:53.839
and if you follow your joy, you know, you will not go wrong.

01:08:54.240 --> 01:09:11.580
You know, I'm, as Paul and Carol and, you know, all of us, I am, you know, so deeply grateful for being, having, you know, I've tripped into Python, you know, 30 years ago.

01:09:12.520 --> 01:09:15.700
It gave me a life, a career.

01:09:16.799 --> 01:09:20.299
It gave me unbelievable friends and community.

01:09:21.839 --> 01:09:30.700
And to anybody thinking about getting involved in Python, not just using it, moving it forward, getting involved and contributing back, you can do it.

01:09:31.240 --> 01:09:32.680
You don't have to be a C guru.

01:09:32.799 --> 01:09:36.740
You don't have to know, you know, you can get into Python things.

01:09:36.880 --> 01:09:39.560
You can get into the governance side.

01:09:39.580 --> 01:09:47.000
You can get into the documentation side, the community side, There are so many avenues into the world of Python.

01:09:47.640 --> 01:09:48.460
You can do it.

01:09:49.180 --> 01:09:49.420
There

01:09:49.420 --> 01:09:49.580
are

01:09:49.580 --> 01:09:54.860
people who will help you and guide you, the wonderful people here.

01:09:55.440 --> 01:09:58.120
So don't feel like it's something unattainable.

01:09:59.320 --> 01:10:03.920
We're all just kind of like normal people who just kind of like add some fun.

01:10:04.120 --> 01:10:04.860
So you can do it too.

01:10:05.860 --> 01:10:16.800
I think one of the really inspirational and maybe unexpected things as you guys were touching on before is there's not a big company behind this.

01:10:16.800 --> 01:10:21.100
It's just people who are doing something funky and different and loved it

01:10:21.240 --> 01:10:21.940
and it's

01:10:21.940 --> 01:10:24.180
taken over the world and how incredible is that?

01:10:25.180 --> 01:10:25.920
Who would have seen that coming?

01:10:27.740 --> 01:10:31.420
Before open source was obviously the thing of the day.

01:10:32.160 --> 01:10:33.100
All right, Brett, final word.

01:10:34.680 --> 01:10:35.660
Yeah, this is hard.

01:10:36.060 --> 01:10:40.560
Jeez, I didn't want to go last after all those phrases because you all stole the ideas one by one.

01:10:43.520 --> 01:10:53.240
Yeah, I mean, really, kind of what Barry just touched on, but I think everyone's touched on, is just the thanks to the community for making this what it is.

01:10:53.480 --> 01:10:56.940
I mean, I know we all played our part, but so did a whole bunch of other people.

01:10:57.360 --> 01:11:04.480
And all the millions of users of Python, which still blows my mind to say, even though I'm not off in that measurement.

01:11:05.880 --> 01:11:07.960
They've all played their part in making the community what it is.

01:11:09.160 --> 01:11:11.160
And I became a dad last year.

01:11:12.940 --> 01:11:15.880
And I mean, all the parents will say it changes how you view things.

01:11:16.040 --> 01:11:29.560
But for me, the way it's changed my view of Python is, A, I can say when my kid comes across Python, not if, and it won't be my doing, it'll be school, which still once again blows my mind.

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:51.220
But that if they were to come to me and say, A, I want to try participating in the Python community, I feel extremely luckily and privileged to be a part of a community where I could say, okay, and not have to think twice about it.

01:11:51.980 --> 01:11:58.160
I don't think we all quite realize how lucky we are to have that in this world, especially the way things are today.

01:11:58.700 --> 01:11:59.060
and

01:11:59.060 --> 01:12:00.060
so thank

01:12:00.060 --> 01:12:15.940
you to all of you for giving my kid a place hopefully I don't know maybe 10 years I don't know how long it takes for the kids to get into Python these days but for them to have a place to come and I can not have to watch over their shoulders about what they're dealing with online

01:12:15.940 --> 01:12:16.680
in that

01:12:16.680 --> 01:12:17.500
community so

01:12:17.500 --> 01:12:18.540
thanks

01:12:18.540 --> 01:12:22.680
to all of you and as I said that includes all the meetings not just the people on this call

01:12:23.680 --> 01:12:26.980
yeah very well put thank you all for

01:12:26.980 --> 01:12:28.280
sharing this story

01:12:28.380 --> 01:12:29.300
Oh, well, you know what?

01:12:29.720 --> 01:12:30.020
Let's make

01:12:30.020 --> 01:12:31.500
you the last person for once.

01:12:31.980 --> 01:12:33.160
Okay, okay, okay.

01:12:33.860 --> 01:12:34.600
I see how this works.

01:12:34.800 --> 01:12:35.380
No, I appreciate that.

01:12:35.920 --> 01:12:46.780
Well, first of all, I can tell you that I've had a similar experience, Brett, with my kid, and that was not with the Python community, and it didn't go as well as you would think.

01:12:47.140 --> 01:12:47.260
And

01:12:47.260 --> 01:12:47.820
I don't care about

01:12:47.820 --> 01:12:49.500
the story, but I haven't talked a lot about it.

01:12:49.540 --> 01:12:50.720
I'm not going to go into it because we're out of time.

01:12:53.460 --> 01:12:55.640
But that story connects with me, let's say that.

01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:58.060
I'll close it out with this.

01:12:58.080 --> 01:13:07.320
I don't know if it makes sense or if it's fair, but I do think it does, to imbue human characteristics into languages.

01:13:07.880 --> 01:13:10.080
But I think Python is a compassionate language.

01:13:10.720 --> 01:13:12.920
I think it welcomes beginners.

01:13:13.880 --> 01:13:24.100
I think it doesn't try to scare you or its community is not full of people who try to impress you with how hard the thing they did is to understand.

01:13:24.180 --> 01:13:44.560
right like yeah yeah that's a void star star but we're cast into this other thing at runtime you know what i mean like because it's templated like no no it welcomes people it's it's built to be welcoming but it doesn't stop once you get started right you can just keep growing into it and i think that's honestly the magic of it yeah

01:13:44.560 --> 01:13:45.200
well i think

01:13:45.200 --> 01:13:46.520
michael you deserve

01:13:46.520 --> 01:13:54.200
credit for so many years stewarding so many different people, how they're using Python,

01:13:54.740 --> 01:13:55.760
sharing them,

01:13:56.080 --> 01:13:57.120
giving them a voice.

01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:28.540
Because, you know, when I first came into Python, it was like, yeah, the language is really cool and gets out of my way. But it was this playground of thousands and thousands of packages that you could do anything.
