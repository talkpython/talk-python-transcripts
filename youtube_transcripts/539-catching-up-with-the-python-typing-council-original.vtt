00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:04.000
<v Michael Kennedy>Hello, Rebecca and Carl.

00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:07.700
<v Michael Kennedy>Welcome to all of you type loving Pythonistas.

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:09.640
<v Michael Kennedy>Awesome to have you here on the show.

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:12.680
<v Michael Kennedy>Thanks for being here.

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:15.340
<v Michael Kennedy>We're going to talk Python typing,

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:19.880
<v Michael Kennedy>especially from the perspective of the Python typing council,

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:24.360
<v Michael Kennedy>which honestly, I am a huge fan of Python typing.

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:26.840
<v Michael Kennedy>It's still something I learned about not too long ago.

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:33.040
<v Michael Kennedy>So I'm going to be learning along with everyone else what it is you all do and so on.

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:36.560
<v Michael Kennedy>So I'm really excited to be diving into this.

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:42.520
<v Michael Kennedy>I think since types came to Python, I think it's made it a little bit more rigorous.

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:47.880
<v Michael Kennedy>You know, for all those people out there like, oh, it's not a real language without any form of static typing.

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:49.040
<v Michael Kennedy>We can't use it on real projects.

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:52.820
<v Michael Kennedy>I don't know how true that was, but certainly it's less true now.

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:54.560
<v Michael Kennedy>You know, you can pick per project.

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:55.380
<v Michael Kennedy>So it's super cool.

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:00.040
<v Michael Kennedy>Before we get into all that, though, let's just go around for a quick introductions.

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:03.440
<v Michael Kennedy>Jala, welcome to the show. Awesome to have you here.

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:08.900
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>Hi, yeah. I'm Jala. I've been on the Python typing council since the beginning.

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:15.440
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>I helped set it up a couple years ago. Outside of my typing work, I currently work at OpenAI,

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:19.859
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>where I work on developer productivity, which means things like running CI for people

00:01:21.319 --> 00:01:24.080
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>and generally helping people be productive.

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.140
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>I've been working with Python for more than a decade.

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.460
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>I started out because my previous job was mostly in Python

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.140
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>and then got more and more involved with the language.

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:35.900
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>Awesome.

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:37.860
<v Michael Kennedy>So let me get this right.

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:41.440
<v Michael Kennedy>At OpenAI, you're basically helping developers there

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:45.040
<v Michael Kennedy>have better developer tooling and common packages

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:46.720
<v Michael Kennedy>and workflows and stuff like that.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:47.580
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>That's right.

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:48.600
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>Yeah.

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:54.480
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>Yeah, mostly around things that happen in CI, like running tests efficiently, figuring

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:58.820
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>out the right tests to run, getting the right CI workers up.

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:01.320
<v Michael Kennedy>Yeah, that sounds very exciting.

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:06.300
<v Michael Kennedy>Right in the epicenter of all the big tech stuff these days.

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.820
<v Michael Kennedy>Super cool.

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:09.240
<v Michael Kennedy>Rebecca, hello, welcome.

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.160
<v Rebecca Chen>Hey, thanks for having me.

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:13.540
<v Rebecca Chen>I'm Rebecca.

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:19.360
<v Rebecca Chen>I've been on the typing council also for about three years, I think,

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:21.940
<v Rebecca Chen>since the, less than three, since the beginning.

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:27.260
<v Rebecca Chen>But my day job, I work at Meta on Python typing,

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:31.980
<v Rebecca Chen>gone Pyrefly, which is a new type checker and language server

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:33.680
<v Rebecca Chen>written in Rust, still in beta.

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:37.940
<v Rebecca Chen>Prior to that, I was at Google for eight years,

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:39.480
<v Rebecca Chen>also on the Python team.

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:40.920
<v Rebecca Chen>I just, I really like Python.

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:42.560
<v Michael Kennedy>Awesome.

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:50.040
<v Michael Kennedy>Yeah, super neat. I'm a big fan of both Pyrefly and ty, which will both have representatives here,

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:55.660
<v Michael Kennedy>I know. And I think it's just a super exciting time for Python types. And certainly that's one

00:02:55.740 --> 00:03:03.580
<v Carl Meyer>of the reasons. So very cool. Carl, welcome back. Thank you. Great to be here. Yeah, Carl Meyer.

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:10.919
<v Carl Meyer>I currently work at Astral, where I work on ty, which is a Python type checker and language server

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:18.600
<v Carl Meyer>written in Rust, also in beta. And yeah, I guess how did I get into typing? Or I've been on the

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:23.860
<v Carl Meyer>typing council not since the beginning. I think it's been a year and a half.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:36.199
<v Carl Meyer>And yeah, I got into Python typing at the time in 2016, 2017. I was working at Instagram and

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:39.320
<v Carl Meyer>That was in the very early days of Python typing.

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:46.780
<v Carl Meyer>The PEP484, PEP483, the early Python typing peps had recently come out within the last couple of years.

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:53.680
<v Carl Meyer>And one of the co-authors of some of those peps, Lukash Lange, was actually sitting at a desk right next to me at the time.

00:03:56.459 --> 00:04:02.420
<v Carl Meyer>And at some point we started to think that we should try this Python typing stuff on the Instagram server monolith.

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:10.140
<v Carl Meyer>And so I took that on as a side project, and then it eventually became the main project, and then it took like three years.

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:13.160
<v Carl Meyer>So a lot of Python typing experience there.

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:15.000
<v Michael Kennedy>Wow, there absolutely is.

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:17.859
<v Michael Kennedy>You know, I think a couple of things I'd like to touch on there.

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:25.800
<v Michael Kennedy>First of all, Instagram, is it maybe the biggest Django deployment in the world?

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:27.360
<v Michael Kennedy>It's certainly one of the bigger ones, right?

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:32.860
<v Michael Kennedy>And I think a lot of people don't necessarily know that a core chunk of Instagram is actually Python, right?

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:42.600
<v Carl Meyer>i don't i mean i don't know if we have any way to know how big uh the django to plant in the

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:47.340
<v Carl Meyer>wild might be but it's certainly a big one yeah it's definitely a big one there was some talks

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:54.300
<v Michael Kennedy>about um dismissing the garbage collector from the instagram folks uh that wasn't you giving the talk

00:04:54.440 --> 00:05:00.699
<v Michael Kennedy>but at pycon so that was pretty interesting but i think actually that work that you're talking

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:07.140
<v Michael Kennedy>about, especially with Lukash, really kind of opened a lot of people's eyes about Python typing.

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:14.780
<v Michael Kennedy>He gave a couple of PyCon talks, showed real metrics of how much of the code base is typed,

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:23.520
<v Michael Kennedy>how much it's changed, like error detection, that kind of stuff. So let me ask you,

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:29.679
<v Michael Kennedy>do you feel like it would be different? Would it have gone different now if tools like ty and

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:36.000
<v Michael Kennedy>Pyrefly exists existed back then is Python typing different now than it was then

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:44.240
<v Carl Meyer>uh certainly yes I mean there's been the type system has gotten

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:49.780
<v Carl Meyer>more complex over time so it is both more expressive and more complex

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:56.159
<v Carl Meyer>and yeah we have more more type checkers available now now

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:08.400
<v Michael Kennedy>Hold on.

00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:11.780
<v Michael Kennedy>I think for some reason my audio just cut out.

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:12.580
<v Michael Kennedy>Can you all still hear me?

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:14.340
<v Carl Meyer>I can hear you.

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:16.260
<v Michael Kennedy>Okay, yeah, it came back.

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:17.000
<v Michael Kennedy>I don't know.

00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:19.800
<v Michael Kennedy>These AirPods.

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:21.240
<v Michael Kennedy>You know how AirPods switch?

00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:28.160
<v Michael Kennedy>I got a text which made a noise on my iPad and I think my sound switched to my iPad.

00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:28.900
<v Michael Kennedy>Anyway, sorry about that.

00:06:29.670 --> 00:06:32.600
<v Michael Kennedy>I do agree that it's more complicated and I don't know how to feel about that.

00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:40.440
<v Michael Kennedy>It is more expressive, but I feel like it's starting to get, I mean, we're not at C++

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:49.400
<v Michael Kennedy>ATL like templates of templates of templates, but still, it's getting more serious.

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:57.220
<v Michael Kennedy>But I guess one of the really nice parts is that you can just take as much as you want of the complexity and you can just leave the rest, right?

00:06:57.780 --> 00:07:02.860
<v Michael Kennedy>That's part of the magic of Python typing is that it's a gradual typing system, right?

00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:07.720
<v Michael Kennedy>That's a choice people get to make.

00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:08.380
<v Michael Kennedy>It can be none.

00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:12.920
<v Michael Kennedy>It can be quite a bit and anywhere in between.

00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:16.660
<v Michael Kennedy>So I guess that's probably one of the decisions.

00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:19.160
<v Michael Kennedy>Let's talk about the typing council.

00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:23.780
<v Michael Kennedy>So when did the typing council come along?

00:07:25.940 --> 00:07:30.520
<v Michael Kennedy>And did the typing council exist to create all these peps and make this happen?

00:07:30.610 --> 00:07:31.680
<v Michael Kennedy>Or was it afterwards?

00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:35.420
<v Michael Kennedy>What's the history of the typing council and its purpose, folks?

00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:37.860
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>Yeah, it postdates most of the peps.

00:07:38.370 --> 00:07:42.400
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>So initially, the type system was created just through the regular  PEP process,

00:07:42.610 --> 00:07:43.960
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>which means that something gets submitted.

00:07:45.140 --> 00:07:47.820
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>At first, still to Guido as the BDFL.

00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:49.580
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>later the steering council.

00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:54.720
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>But that meant that it's very hard to make changes to like this specification.

00:07:54.990 --> 00:07:58.520
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>Like anytime we want to make change something about how the type systems would work,

00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:00.960
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>we had to go through this PEP procedure,

00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:03.640
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>talk to the steering council who are very busy people

00:08:03.900 --> 00:08:06.900
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>who deal with a lot of other aspects of the language other than typing.

00:08:07.980 --> 00:08:13.000
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>So, Shantanu and I came up with this idea of creating a separate council

00:08:13.780 --> 00:08:15.279
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>to specifically in charge of typing

00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:17.360
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>that would be in a specification

00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:19.440
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>where we can make small changes ourselves

00:08:19.740 --> 00:08:21.440
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>without having to go through this whole PEP process.

00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:26.060
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>And this way, when all the type checkers agree

00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:27.680
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>that something needs to go a certain way

00:08:27.820 --> 00:08:29.240
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>and it's not exactly what's in the PEPs,

00:08:29.740 --> 00:08:32.780
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>we can change it and have a place to record that

00:08:32.940 --> 00:08:34.020
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>and people can refer to it

00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:36.940
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>and new type checkers can also try to follow those decisions.

00:08:39.419 --> 00:08:39.900
<v Michael Kennedy>Very interesting.

00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:41.520
<v Michael Kennedy>I didn't realize that it was sort of,

00:08:42.340 --> 00:08:46.660
<v Michael Kennedy>was there to allow for small changes to be made to make that much easier.

00:08:46.770 --> 00:08:49.120
<v Michael Kennedy>But of course that makes sense because the PEP process is,

00:08:50.060 --> 00:08:51.560
<v Michael Kennedy>it's pretty serious and drawn out.

00:08:51.570 --> 00:08:58.880
<v Michael Kennedy>And we've seen even small language changes have quite passionate folks,

00:08:58.910 --> 00:09:00.640
<v Michael Kennedy>I guess we should say.

00:09:05.180 --> 00:09:06.620
<v Michael Kennedy>So yeah, yeah, very nice.

00:09:09.940 --> 00:09:18.560
<v Michael Kennedy>Do you have any examples of the types of changes that you all have that have happened over the years that maybe were typing council only?

00:09:23.660 --> 00:09:28.580
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>One was the specification for how overloads work, which is perhaps not really a small change.

00:09:28.700 --> 00:09:35.920
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>But one of the most complicated features in the type system really is the overloads, where you can give multiple signatures for a function.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.800
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>and type checkers sort of select which one to use

00:09:40.040 --> 00:09:42.140
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>based on the arguments when the function is called.

00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:44.840
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>And when it was initially created,

00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:46.460
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>I, from what I recall,

00:09:46.860 --> 00:09:48.280
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>there just wasn't really a specification.

00:09:48.740 --> 00:09:50.860
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>It's just like you use the signatures

00:09:51.180 --> 00:09:52.260
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>in a way that makes sense.

00:09:53.820 --> 00:09:55.820
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>And Eric Trout, who's currently on the council

00:09:56.180 --> 00:09:58.800
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>came up with a pretty specific procedure

00:09:58.920 --> 00:10:00.680
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>for exactly how overload should work

00:10:01.580 --> 00:10:03.840
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>to make it so that type checkers have,

00:10:04.840 --> 00:10:06.419
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>both sort of users can understand how it works

00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:10.300
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>type checkers can have something to work towards to make sure that they will implement overloads

00:10:10.300 --> 00:10:16.780
<v Carl Meyer>in the same way. Yeah. Maybe a smaller example that is an example of something that would have been

00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:23.040
<v Carl Meyer>too small for a  PEP and hard to accomplish before the typing council existed. And this

00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:28.860
<v Carl Meyer>is actually a change that I pushed through before I was on the typing council, but the typing

00:10:29.060 --> 00:10:36.400
<v Carl Meyer>council approved it, was a clarification around the interpretation of data class fields. If a final

00:10:36.440 --> 00:10:43.740
<v Carl Meyer>annotation is applied to a data class field, does that mean, so if you apply a final annotation to

00:10:43.740 --> 00:10:48.840
<v Carl Meyer>a regular class attribute, since it can't be changed, that implies that it's a class variable.

00:10:49.620 --> 00:10:53.040
<v Carl Meyer>And there was a question of if that should be the interpretation with the data class or not.

00:10:53.640 --> 00:11:00.100
<v Michael Kennedy>So we discussed that and made a clarification to the spec. Okay, interesting. I've never really

00:11:00.100 --> 00:11:04.820
<v Michael Kennedy>thought about final being applied to a class field,

00:11:05.060 --> 00:11:07.180
<v Michael Kennedy>but I've always used them sort of just for constants.

00:11:08.220 --> 00:11:09.920
<v Michael Kennedy>But maybe people out there don't know,

00:11:10.280 --> 00:11:13.960
<v Michael Kennedy>like typing dot final bracket type, right?

00:11:15.460 --> 00:11:18.280
<v Michael Kennedy>That's kind of the way you can do constants in Python, right?

00:11:20.860 --> 00:11:22.200
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>Constant for the type checker.

00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:24.340
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>Nothing in the runtime will stop you from editing it.

00:11:25.220 --> 00:11:25.700
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>But--

00:11:25.700 --> 00:11:26.500
<v Michael Kennedy>Not there.

00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:27.380
<v Michael Kennedy>Not there.

00:11:27.580 --> 00:11:29.320
<v Michael Kennedy>I have some examples coming up, and I'm

00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:31.380
<v Michael Kennedy>interested to hear your thoughts on them.

00:11:31.480 --> 00:11:35.400
<v Michael Kennedy>But for sure, there is this tension, right?

00:11:35.860 --> 00:11:38.120
<v Michael Kennedy>I think that's probably worth touching on as well

00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:40.600
<v Michael Kennedy>is this is a tension for Python in general

00:11:40.860 --> 00:11:43.340
<v Michael Kennedy>is you can write all the types you want.

00:11:43.920 --> 00:11:48.060
<v Michael Kennedy>And then when you run your code, it just doesn't care.

00:11:48.180 --> 00:11:52.120
<v Michael Kennedy>There's a few instances, Pydantic, FastAPI, a few others.

00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:55.120
<v Michael Kennedy>But generally speaking, it's there

00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:57.300
<v Michael Kennedy>for the editors and the type checkers and the linters.

00:11:57.520 --> 00:12:00.980
<v Michael Kennedy>and not for runtime, right?

00:12:04.330 --> 00:12:04.960
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>- Yeah, that's right.

00:12:05.380 --> 00:12:07.680
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>There's many exceptions to that.

00:12:07.940 --> 00:12:10.320
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>There's a product like mypyC,

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.060
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>which comes with mypy that's used those types

00:12:13.260 --> 00:12:16.340
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>to compile your code into more efficient machine codes.

00:12:17.760 --> 00:12:19.100
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>Maybe there's gonna be more products like that

00:12:19.100 --> 00:12:20.040
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>in the future, I don't know.

00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:23.260
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>But yes, in general, it's separate from the runtime.

00:12:24.140 --> 00:12:26.599
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>Sort of a similar model to TypeScript

00:12:26.620 --> 00:12:28.740
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>where TypeScript gets compiled into JavaScript

00:12:28.980 --> 00:12:29.940
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>and types just go away.

00:12:30.580 --> 00:12:31.980
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>Here we don't do a compilation step,

00:12:32.140 --> 00:12:33.620
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>but still the same idea of the types,

00:12:33.840 --> 00:12:35.100
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>just not influencing the runtime.

00:12:36.400 --> 00:12:38.960
<v Carl Meyer>- Although we do make them available for introspection

00:12:39.340 --> 00:12:40.780
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>via the annotations attributes,

00:12:41.180 --> 00:12:44.140
<v Carl Meyer>which is what has enabled the projects like Pydantic

00:12:44.420 --> 00:12:46.540
<v Carl Meyer>and other sort of runtime checkers

00:12:46.740 --> 00:12:49.280
<v Carl Meyer>to make use of type annotations at runtime also.

00:12:49.860 --> 00:12:51.520
<v Michael Kennedy>- Yeah, I don't know if the typing council

00:12:51.720 --> 00:12:52.460
<v Michael Kennedy>was around for this,

00:12:52.560 --> 00:12:55.460
<v Michael Kennedy>but there was a proposal,

00:12:55.620 --> 00:13:01.500
<v Michael Kennedy>I don't remember the exact details, but something to the effect of for type checking, not actually

00:13:01.780 --> 00:13:06.880
<v Michael Kennedy>doing some of the full imports or something along those lines, right?

00:13:06.980 --> 00:13:11.720
<v Michael Kennedy>Where the runtime behavior would have made it hard for tools like Pydantic and others

00:13:11.820 --> 00:13:12.420
<v Michael Kennedy>to get that.

00:13:12.920 --> 00:13:14.720
<v Michael Kennedy>And there was some kind of compromise, right?

00:13:14.760 --> 00:13:15.720
<v Michael Kennedy>I don't remember the details.

00:13:16.220 --> 00:13:16.600
<v Rebecca Chen>Anyone does?

00:13:17.240 --> 00:13:18.120
<v Rebecca Chen>Future import?

00:13:18.960 --> 00:13:19.740
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>Yes, I think so.

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:23.180
<v Rebecca Chen>Yeah, it's like 563 and 649 or something.

00:13:24.120 --> 00:13:24.840
<v Carl Meyer>And 749.

00:13:25.520 --> 00:13:31.600
<v Rebecca Chen>Yeah, what happened was that there was going to be a change. That's what the from future

00:13:31.740 --> 00:13:37.200
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>import annotations import does. It changes all annotations into raw strings. So the default

00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:43.440
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>behavior before recently was that annotations are regular codes. If you write devf return

00:13:43.530 --> 00:13:48.259
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>to ints and you import the module, it just looks up the name ints and puts that in annotations

00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:55.480
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>dictionary, which makes introspection easy, but it's made, it has some costs on performance

00:13:55.880 --> 00:14:00.160
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>because memory usage sometimes is high and also made things harder to use sometimes because

00:14:01.180 --> 00:14:06.060
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>if you use a name that's not defined yet at runtime, you get an error. That often comes

00:14:06.080 --> 00:14:14.379
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>up if you have like a class that has a reference in an annotation to the class itself or circular

00:14:14.400 --> 00:14:21.280
<v Michael Kennedy>dependency classes right the circular imports because you want to say this

00:14:21.340 --> 00:14:27.240
<v Michael Kennedy>glass is created by that thing and it returns one but you know somehow you've

00:14:27.300 --> 00:14:33.180
<v Michael Kennedy>got to import the other one and that's such a hassle yeah it's yeah even out in

00:14:33.180 --> 00:14:40.359
<v Michael Kennedy>the audience we have circular imports oh yeah for sure what about lazy imports

00:14:40.380 --> 00:14:43.040
<v Michael Kennedy>That just recently got accepted and will be in 3.15,

00:14:44.080 --> 00:14:45.700
<v Michael Kennedy>which I'm super excited about

00:14:45.870 --> 00:14:48.480
<v Michael Kennedy>because I think it'll make app startup a lot faster

00:14:49.060 --> 00:14:50.680
<v Michael Kennedy>for many use cases.

00:14:51.560 --> 00:14:53.600
<v Michael Kennedy>But does that have knock-on effects for typing?

00:14:57.480 --> 00:14:58.560
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>Not that directly,

00:14:58.980 --> 00:15:00.860
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>because I think for a type checker,

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.380
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>lazy imports mostly just look like regular imports.

00:15:03.800 --> 00:15:05.560
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>I guess I should maybe leave that to the people

00:15:05.560 --> 00:15:07.300
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>who are actually working on type checkers

00:15:07.360 --> 00:15:08.300
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>that are being written right now.

00:15:10.320 --> 00:15:17.460
<v Michael Kennedy>yeah yeah rebecca do you see this making any difference for you lazy imports yeah uh

00:15:18.680 --> 00:15:25.520
<v Rebecca Chen>to be honest it's not something we've uh looked at too carefully yet 315 it seems a little

00:15:26.400 --> 00:15:32.500
<v Rebecca Chen>fine in the future but i don't think it's likely to make a huge difference

00:15:36.880 --> 00:15:37.040
<v Carl Meyer>Karl?

00:15:38.860 --> 00:15:43.600
<v Carl Meyer>Yeah, I've thought about it briefly, and I think that it, I think the type checkers really won't need to care.

00:15:44.560 --> 00:15:48.080
<v Carl Meyer>Maybe there will be some edge cases that will come up that I haven't thought of, but it shouldn't be a big deal.

00:15:48.940 --> 00:15:50.260
<v Michael Kennedy>Yeah, that's what I thought as well.

00:15:50.440 --> 00:15:58.720
<v Michael Kennedy>the one variation that I can certainly see is if you have a type if you have something specified

00:15:58.940 --> 00:16:05.880
<v Michael Kennedy>in a type like say for a field of a class or a pydantic model or something that would otherwise

00:16:06.310 --> 00:16:13.320
<v Michael Kennedy>not trigger the lazy import to become imported would potentially having types specify

00:16:14.410 --> 00:16:20.280
<v Michael Kennedy>cause more importing to happen sooner in the runtime yeah there's actually an issue related

00:16:20.300 --> 00:16:25.460
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>But I think we may need to resolve before 3.15, but I don't know how yet.

00:16:26.800 --> 00:16:32.220
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>In data classes, if you have, if you use a type in a data class annotation that's lazily

00:16:32.380 --> 00:16:35.780
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>imported, actually creating a data class will delay the import.

00:16:36.140 --> 00:16:41.720
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>It will try to resolve the import and actually make it not lazy.

00:16:42.460 --> 00:16:46.620
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>This is because data classes doesn't really need to look at all of the annotations in

00:16:46.580 --> 00:16:51.720
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>year class but it looks at them enough to trigger reification of the imports.

00:16:53.690 --> 00:16:57.560
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>I shared this with some of the people on the lazy imports team but we haven't yet come up

00:16:57.560 --> 00:16:58.520
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>with a good way around it.

00:16:58.650 --> 00:17:02.640
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>I think this might end up being a bit of a food gun so I feel like we should ideally

00:17:02.880 --> 00:17:05.339
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>find a workaround but I don't know what it would be yet.

00:17:05.820 --> 00:17:11.920
<v Michael Kennedy>Yeah, I don't know that it's wrong that it converts it to an eager import which it needs

00:17:12.069 --> 00:17:13.839
<v Michael Kennedy>to know what it is potentially, right?

00:17:14.079 --> 00:17:17.980
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>It actually doesn't. Data classes just need to know whether it's a classifier or not.

00:17:19.680 --> 00:17:23.560
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>I think that's pretty much all. I guess there's an initifier also, but it doesn't really need to

00:17:23.600 --> 00:17:29.080
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>know anything else. In theory, it should be possible to just say, hey, this is not classifier,

00:17:29.300 --> 00:17:33.780
<v Michael Kennedy>so don't bother importing it. Interesting. That's for data classes,

00:17:34.040 --> 00:17:40.600
<v Michael Kennedy>but say if I specify a parameter type on a function. Yeah, then it should be fine. I guess,

00:17:40.840 --> 00:17:46.180
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>again unless something is uh if it does annotations so if you have something like a decorator that

00:17:46.340 --> 00:17:54.000
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>looks at annotations in your function it might reify those imports okay interesting there is one

00:17:54.070 --> 00:18:00.020
<v Carl Meyer>other potentially interesting thing for type checkers it's already uh difficult for type

00:18:00.200 --> 00:18:10.780
<v Carl Meyer>checkers to figure out when uh like a sub module should be considered to be an attribute of the

00:18:10.800 --> 00:18:17.260
<v Carl Meyer>anywhere will attach that submodule as an attribute on the parent module. But at runtime,

00:18:18.180 --> 00:18:21.680
<v Carl Meyer>that could literally happen anywhere. It could happen in totally unrelated code outside of the

00:18:21.830 --> 00:18:26.860
<v Carl Meyer>module, and a type checker probably won't be able to see that. So type checkers already have sort

00:18:26.870 --> 00:18:31.920
<v Carl Meyer>of complex sets of rules around where they look for these submodule imports and when they consider

00:18:31.930 --> 00:18:39.520
<v Carl Meyer>a submodule import to be reliably happening enough that the type checker should consider

00:18:39.540 --> 00:18:47.280
<v Carl Meyer>this submodule to exist as an attribute. And lazy imports may make that even... We'll add one more

00:18:47.460 --> 00:18:52.760
<v Carl Meyer>wrinkle to those bits of heuristics in that we'll have to decide if you have a lazy import of a

00:18:52.940 --> 00:18:59.420
<v Carl Meyer>submodule and you're under init.py, it's lazy. So should the type checker consider that submodule to

00:19:00.160 --> 00:19:06.160
<v Carl Meyer>be imported or not be imported? I think it'll be another case where there's no clear right answer

00:19:06.180 --> 00:19:09.440
<v Carl Meyer>and we'll just have to make a decision one way or the other.

00:19:10.180 --> 00:19:10.300
<v Michael Kennedy>Right.

00:19:11.160 --> 00:19:13.180
<v Michael Kennedy>Yeah, there's some variations across type checkers,

00:19:13.270 --> 00:19:15.240
<v Michael Kennedy>which we'll get to later.

00:19:16.020 --> 00:19:18.080
<v Michael Kennedy>I think, though, before we move off this,

00:19:18.680 --> 00:19:21.740
<v Michael Kennedy>there's actually off introducing the typing council.

00:19:21.900 --> 00:19:24.560
<v Michael Kennedy>I think we should point out that there's two other folks

00:19:24.590 --> 00:19:27.460
<v Michael Kennedy>who couldn't be here who are also on the typing council,

00:19:27.730 --> 00:19:32.360
<v Michael Kennedy>Eric Trout and Yuka Letosilo.

00:19:33.020 --> 00:19:34.360
<v Michael Kennedy>Sorry, Yuka.

00:19:35.540 --> 00:19:39.120
<v Michael Kennedy>But I want to make sure that we point out there's actually five people, not just the three of you, right?

00:19:41.420 --> 00:19:42.940
<v Michael Kennedy>How do you get on the council?

00:19:43.800 --> 00:19:44.540
<v Michael Kennedy>Is there an election?

00:19:44.940 --> 00:19:46.200
<v Michael Kennedy>Do you just apply?

00:19:51.880 --> 00:19:53.400
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>Vacancies are filled by the members themselves.

00:19:53.680 --> 00:20:00.460
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>So when somebody declares the intention to leave the council, we basically ask for people who are interested and then make a selection.

00:20:01.840 --> 00:20:05.040
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>Generally, we try to get people who have experience in the type system.

00:20:05.840 --> 00:20:09.060
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>We try to get a good cross-representation of people working on different type checkers.

00:20:11.200 --> 00:20:17.040
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>So we have Carl and Rebecca here who work on two type checkers, ty and Pyrefly.

00:20:18.020 --> 00:20:19.380
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>Yuka works on mypy.

00:20:19.530 --> 00:20:22.920
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>Eric Chart works on Pyrites, which are two of the most widely used type checkers.

00:20:25.580 --> 00:20:30.000
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>Yeah, so we try to get wider representation of people working on those parts of the ecosystem.

00:20:30.180 --> 00:20:31.400
<v Michael Kennedy>Yeah, that's really cool about it.

00:20:31.740 --> 00:20:34.760
<v Michael Kennedy>you know, it's got a bias towards finding people actually doing the work.

00:20:36.400 --> 00:20:41.020
<v Michael Kennedy>So let's talk about the specification project at typing.python.org.

00:20:42.300 --> 00:20:43.880
<v Michael Kennedy>What is, what is this here?

00:20:50.320 --> 00:20:51.520
<v Rebecca Chen>I mean, I can.

00:20:51.980 --> 00:20:52.500
<v Rebecca Chen>Yeah, go for it.

00:20:53.060 --> 00:20:58.879
<v Rebecca Chen>Talk a bit about, I guess it's a specification for how the type system

00:20:59.320 --> 00:21:04.500
<v Rebecca Chen>used to work. The way it started was that, Yala, you basically took all the typing peps and like

00:21:04.900 --> 00:21:12.240
<v Rebecca Chen>stapled them together, right, to make like one long doc. And since then, we've been iterating on it,

00:21:12.620 --> 00:21:19.180
<v Rebecca Chen>filling in parts that were missing, like overload evaluation and making other changes as well.

00:21:20.260 --> 00:21:28.219
<v Michael Kennedy>Yeah, it's tricky, right? Because traditionally, the typing system is kind of defined across a

00:21:28.220 --> 00:21:29.480
<v Michael Kennedy>series of peps, right?

00:21:30.940 --> 00:21:33.280
<v Michael Kennedy>And so what is the document that tells you how it works, right?

00:21:34.800 --> 00:21:38.760
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>Yeah, that is hard because often those peps build on top of each other.

00:21:39.900 --> 00:21:45.320
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>So then in the extreme, you might see like one thing in one  PEP and then another  PEP that

00:21:45.420 --> 00:21:47.640
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>adds an aspect of it, another one that adds another aspect.

00:21:49.080 --> 00:21:50.500
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>And overall it makes it very hard to follow.

00:21:51.210 --> 00:21:54.340
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>One of the things I did recently was rewrite the typed dict spec.

00:21:55.180 --> 00:22:01.860
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>dict is a feature of the python type system that has been added to a lot from one  PEP to another

00:22:02.720 --> 00:22:07.280
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>and i ended up rewriting the whole thing to basically put all those features together in

00:22:07.740 --> 00:22:12.800
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>a coherent whole rather than just having them all copy pasted one after the other

00:22:14.220 --> 00:22:20.519
<v Michael Kennedy>very nice okay so if somebody really wants a good understanding of the python type system

00:22:21.360 --> 00:22:23.160
<v Michael Kennedy>They go to typing.python.org.

00:22:24.300 --> 00:22:26.440
<v Michael Kennedy>You know, one thing I think maybe is worth touching on,

00:22:26.660 --> 00:22:30.100
<v Michael Kennedy>it's just kind of out of the blue a bit,

00:22:30.260 --> 00:22:32.080
<v Michael Kennedy>but I think it's a really interesting aspect

00:22:32.480 --> 00:22:35.260
<v Michael Kennedy>of the Python typing system is the,

00:22:35.630 --> 00:22:37.940
<v Michael Kennedy>what is it called, the numerical tower or the number tower,

00:22:39.080 --> 00:22:42.020
<v Michael Kennedy>where it's like, if I have a number,

00:22:42.490 --> 00:22:44.360
<v Michael Kennedy>I could specify it as an int,

00:22:44.840 --> 00:22:46.440
<v Michael Kennedy>or I could specify it as a float,

00:22:47.320 --> 00:22:48.280
<v Michael Kennedy>and those kinds of things.

00:22:49.760 --> 00:22:55.460
<v Michael Kennedy>But do you really need to say it's a int pipe float

00:22:55.640 --> 00:22:58.340
<v Michael Kennedy>or a union of int and float if it could be either, right?

00:22:58.460 --> 00:22:59.700
<v Michael Kennedy>And what is it called?

00:22:59.880 --> 00:23:01.220
<v Michael Kennedy>It's the numerical tower, right?

00:23:04.240 --> 00:23:05.660
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>There are many different-- yeah, there

00:23:05.660 --> 00:23:06.640
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>are different towers too.

00:23:06.800 --> 00:23:09.080
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>In Python, there's also this thing called a numbers module

00:23:09.360 --> 00:23:11.280
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>that you have there.

00:23:11.920 --> 00:23:13.820
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>That's just basically ignored by the type system.

00:23:15.160 --> 00:23:16.640
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>I think it's--

00:23:17.539 --> 00:23:18.160
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>I don't know.

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:20.160
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>It's been useful for some people.

00:23:20.220 --> 00:23:23.860
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>I feel like in general that module just hasn't worked out very well as being very useful.

00:23:25.420 --> 00:23:29.860
<v Michael Kennedy>Yeah, I think the item, for some reason I'm failing to find this in real time.

00:23:29.880 --> 00:23:35.400
<v Michael Kennedy>But I think the interesting aspect is that you can say it's a float,

00:23:35.500 --> 00:23:41.000
<v Michael Kennedy>and that's basically equivalent to union of integer and float and so on, right?

00:23:41.200 --> 00:23:44.320
<v Michael Kennedy>I think the typing numbers in Python is pretty interesting.

00:23:46.160 --> 00:23:52.640
<v Carl Meyer>I think every type checker has a different interpretation of what a float annotation actually means.

00:23:53.520 --> 00:23:54.100
<v Carl Meyer>Oh, really?

00:23:54.360 --> 00:23:57.660
<v Carl Meyer>It's an area of some lack of clarity in the spec.

00:23:59.300 --> 00:24:00.520
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>Yeah, and a lot of contentiousness.

00:24:01.600 --> 00:24:05.760
<v Rebecca Chen>If we could go back in time, I would...

00:24:05.760 --> 00:24:09.460
<v Rebecca Chen>Knowing what I know now, I'd probably advocate for things being done differently.

00:24:09.720 --> 00:24:16.120
<v Rebecca Chen>because like beginning, you know, like there were multiple things like with similar flavor,

00:24:16.360 --> 00:24:22.020
<v Rebecca Chen>like there was also one where you could put, give some, give a parameter a non-none annotation

00:24:22.270 --> 00:24:24.420
<v Rebecca Chen>and default it to none for convenience.

00:24:24.730 --> 00:24:28.820
<v Rebecca Chen>And we've largely like moved away from stuff like that in favor of explicitness.

00:24:29.600 --> 00:24:33.460
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>Yeah, what the current spec says is that basically if you have a function that takes a float,

00:24:34.040 --> 00:24:35.540
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>you're also allowed to pass an int.

00:24:36.560 --> 00:24:39.160
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>But that's not really enough.

00:24:39.400 --> 00:24:41.940
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>It doesn't tell you how these things work in all cases.

00:24:43.640 --> 00:24:47.560
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>And we've had some attempts to try to come up with a way

00:24:47.780 --> 00:24:52.540
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>to specify that special case in a way that makes more sense,

00:24:52.880 --> 00:24:53.840
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>at least makes more sense to me.

00:24:54.900 --> 00:24:55.820
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>It's been very contentious.

00:24:56.060 --> 00:24:57.700
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>People have very strong opinions about this.

00:24:59.200 --> 00:24:59.640
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>Yeah.

00:25:02.300 --> 00:25:03.760
<v Michael Kennedy>It is a little weird, isn't it?

00:25:04.420 --> 00:25:05.020
<v Michael Kennedy>It's quite weird.

00:25:05.320 --> 00:25:07.860
<v Michael Kennedy>I guess non-obvious is what I'd like to say, really,

00:25:08.200 --> 00:25:19.360
<v Michael Kennedy>honestly. So I'd like to get the official counsel's thoughts on this. When, when is too much,

00:25:19.600 --> 00:25:25.960
<v Michael Kennedy>when is typing too much typing, right? I made the joke about C++ ATL. If you've ever worked with

00:25:26.080 --> 00:25:31.520
<v Michael Kennedy>that, it's like a parameter, you know, a template class where templated classes are part of the

00:25:31.700 --> 00:25:36.319
<v Michael Kennedy>concrete type of the template. Like it's just off the hook. There's certainly places where

00:25:36.800 --> 00:25:45.800
<v Michael Kennedy>typing can be too much. And a lot of the purity of Python or the readability of Python is the fact

00:25:45.940 --> 00:25:52.380
<v Michael Kennedy>that it's got so few symbols. And so adding types adds context, but it also takes away,

00:25:53.080 --> 00:25:58.560
<v Michael Kennedy>you know, makes it a little harder to read. When is too much typing? When do you recommend typing?

00:25:58.860 --> 00:26:03.640
<v Michael Kennedy>You know, maybe Rebecca, I'll let you go first, but like, what are your thoughts in the sort of,

00:26:03.860 --> 00:26:06.120
<v Michael Kennedy>How much typing should I use in Python?

00:26:10.200 --> 00:26:14.600
<v Rebecca Chen>I'll give you what is sort of my official stance,

00:26:14.720 --> 00:26:17.240
<v Rebecca Chen>which is that if you want your type checker to work well,

00:26:17.900 --> 00:26:20.700
<v Rebecca Chen>you should type annotate your API boundaries.

00:26:21.320 --> 00:26:23.520
<v Rebecca Chen>So like parameters and returns in public functions,

00:26:24.040 --> 00:26:26.460
<v Rebecca Chen>public class attributes, things like that.

00:26:26.720 --> 00:26:28.680
<v Rebecca Chen>And like even things that seem trivial,

00:26:28.900 --> 00:26:31.500
<v Rebecca Chen>like, oh, this function returns none,

00:26:32.180 --> 00:26:37.500
<v Rebecca Chen>better to annotate it because you know someone else might be depending on your library and

00:26:37.780 --> 00:26:46.400
<v Rebecca Chen>consuming that type of information. I will say personally what I tend to do is like I annotate

00:26:46.460 --> 00:26:53.980
<v Rebecca Chen>things that I think are non-trivial because I want to see that as documentation and if something

00:26:54.640 --> 00:26:59.119
<v Rebecca Chen>like you know a function that does return none to be honest I will probably forget to annotate it

00:26:59.180 --> 00:27:03.240
<v Rebecca Chen>half the time because i'll be like i honestly don't need to see it so

00:27:06.580 --> 00:27:14.300
<v Michael Kennedy>yeah you know one of the interesting features of the pyrefly vs code extension that's the only one

00:27:14.340 --> 00:27:18.860
<v Michael Kennedy>i can speak of at the moment and carl you've got to tell me if the ty one does this as well

00:27:19.480 --> 00:27:27.780
<v Michael Kennedy>is it will sort of overlay its belief of what types are like if there's you say x equals a

00:27:27.780 --> 00:27:30.060
<v Michael Kennedy>a function return value and it knows what the function returns,

00:27:30.260 --> 00:27:33.540
<v Michael Kennedy>it'll have a gray like colon int if it returned an int or something.

00:27:33.940 --> 00:27:37.980
<v Michael Kennedy>So you can read the code and see what the types are

00:27:38.160 --> 00:27:40.980
<v Michael Kennedy>without actually putting it into the text of the code.

00:27:41.160 --> 00:27:42.100
<v Michael Kennedy>It's only within the editor.

00:27:43.400 --> 00:27:44.580
<v Michael Kennedy>Does ty do something like that, Carl?

00:27:45.440 --> 00:27:47.360
<v Carl Meyer>Yes, we also have inlay type ints.

00:27:47.660 --> 00:27:48.500
<v Michael Kennedy>Yeah, inlay type ints.

00:27:48.560 --> 00:27:49.000
<v Michael Kennedy>That's what it's called.

00:27:49.240 --> 00:27:51.040
<v Michael Kennedy>So yeah, I don't know.

00:27:51.140 --> 00:27:53.620
<v Michael Kennedy>That also brings an interesting challenge-- not a challenge,

00:27:53.780 --> 00:27:56.980
<v Michael Kennedy>like a wrinkle to the recommendation of,

00:27:59.470 --> 00:28:02.220
<v Michael Kennedy>should I put types on like the return value

00:28:02.350 --> 00:28:03.960
<v Michael Kennedy>because I want to know that's a list of user,

00:28:04.180 --> 00:28:06.900
<v Michael Kennedy>not a list of user IDs or whatever, for example,

00:28:07.080 --> 00:28:08.100
<v Michael Kennedy>like a list of UUID.

00:28:09.920 --> 00:28:12.680
<v Michael Kennedy>But if it's going to show up anyway in the editor,

00:28:13.460 --> 00:28:15.020
<v Michael Kennedy>maybe I don't have to write that, right?

00:28:15.070 --> 00:28:18.560
<v Michael Kennedy>And so that becomes sort of somewhere

00:28:18.610 --> 00:28:20.200
<v Michael Kennedy>where you could debate again, I think.

00:28:20.640 --> 00:28:23.360
<v Michael Kennedy>However, I do 100% agree with you, Rebecca,

00:28:23.420 --> 00:28:25.260
<v Michael Kennedy>that put it on your API boundaries.

00:28:25.540 --> 00:28:30.260
<v Michael Kennedy>If this is the place that people get into some part of your code

00:28:30.420 --> 00:28:33.020
<v Michael Kennedy>and they don't know or want to know about the inside of it,

00:28:33.820 --> 00:28:36.580
<v Michael Kennedy>having types there is really helpful both for editors,

00:28:37.660 --> 00:28:39.760
<v Michael Kennedy>for type checkers, and just for reading code,

00:28:39.940 --> 00:28:42.120
<v Michael Kennedy>and even for AI, which is a crazy world.

00:28:43.100 --> 00:28:43.180
<v Michael Kennedy>Yeah.

00:28:43.630 --> 00:28:45.240
<v Michael Kennedy>Carl, what are your thoughts here?

00:28:45.320 --> 00:28:46.540
<v Michael Kennedy>How much typing is too much typing?

00:28:47.160 --> 00:28:48.460
<v Michael Kennedy>What's the guidelines here?

00:28:49.600 --> 00:28:52.840
<v Carl Meyer>I think I agree with Rebecca's answer.

00:28:52.980 --> 00:29:02.260
<v Carl Meyer>I mean, that one place you definitely want to have explicit type annotations is that API boundaries, public API of a library, et cetera.

00:29:03.260 --> 00:29:22.460
<v Carl Meyer>In terms of what's too much typing, I mean, there's certainly patterns that have historically been used in Python that we still can't express well in the type system or that require extremely complex type annotations to express well.

00:29:22.540 --> 00:29:25.760
<v Carl Meyer>And I think there it becomes a judgment call.

00:29:27.380 --> 00:29:31.300
<v Carl Meyer>If it's like a core widely used API,

00:29:31.790 --> 00:29:33.340
<v Carl Meyer>you may get a lot of benefit

00:29:33.960 --> 00:29:36.360
<v Carl Meyer>from some very complex and verbose annotations.

00:29:37.280 --> 00:29:40.320
<v Carl Meyer>And so then it's worth sort of going through that pain

00:29:40.480 --> 00:29:43.400
<v Carl Meyer>and the pain of adding them and of reading them

00:29:43.610 --> 00:29:46.320
<v Carl Meyer>in order to get that additional typing coverage

00:29:46.600 --> 00:29:47.680
<v Carl Meyer>everywhere you use that API.

00:29:48.860 --> 00:29:51.579
<v Carl Meyer>If it's much less frequently used code

00:29:51.600 --> 00:29:54.660
<v Carl Meyer>that's highly dynamic, maybe it's not worth it in that case.

00:29:55.290 --> 00:29:56.740
<v Carl Meyer>I think there's a lot of judgment calls here.

00:29:57.180 --> 00:29:59.600
<v Michael Kennedy>What about one-off scripts?

00:30:01.260 --> 00:30:04.080
<v Michael Kennedy>I'm going to write this thing to just move this data from here to there.

00:30:04.220 --> 00:30:05.520
<v Michael Kennedy>Once it's moved, I don't need it again.

00:30:06.920 --> 00:30:07.900
<v Michael Kennedy>We're done with that old system.

00:30:07.990 --> 00:30:08.860
<v Michael Kennedy>We're going to the new one.

00:30:09.900 --> 00:30:10.580
<v Michael Kennedy>Maybe less typing.

00:30:12.680 --> 00:30:14.440
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>Yeah, I think that's what's useful for you.

00:30:15.440 --> 00:30:17.640
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>Often I feel like one-off scripts are not really one-off.

00:30:17.780 --> 00:30:19.680
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>Maybe you want to move some similar data later,

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:22.080
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>And then it's useful if you can understand your code again,

00:30:22.230 --> 00:30:23.880
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>if you want to read what you did.

00:30:24.600 --> 00:30:26.020
<v Michael Kennedy>You thought you didn't need it again.

00:30:26.180 --> 00:30:27.660
<v Michael Kennedy>And all of a sudden, at six months old,

00:30:27.710 --> 00:30:28.620
<v Michael Kennedy>you don't understand it.

00:30:29.310 --> 00:30:30.560
<v Michael Kennedy>And the types would help a lot, right?

00:30:31.420 --> 00:30:31.480
<v Michael Kennedy>Yeah.

00:30:32.180 --> 00:30:32.360
<v Michael Kennedy>Yeah.

00:30:33.120 --> 00:30:35.020
<v Michael Kennedy>Jelal, what's your advice?

00:30:35.640 --> 00:30:38.140
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>Yeah, I think what Kar and Rebecca said

00:30:38.340 --> 00:30:38.980
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>makes sense to me too.

00:30:39.930 --> 00:30:44.380
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>I think types have advantages in terms of documenting human

00:30:44.560 --> 00:30:48.279
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>readers, what is going on, and in terms of catching mistakes

00:30:48.300 --> 00:30:50.700
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>that otherwise would not be called until runtime, perhaps.

00:30:51.660 --> 00:30:53.840
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>They have costs in maybe making your code harder to reach

00:30:53.890 --> 00:30:55.020
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>if there's too much going on.

00:30:56.020 --> 00:30:58.760
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>So add types as long as those benefits outweigh the costs.

00:31:01.080 --> 00:31:01.600
<v Michael Kennedy>Yeah.

00:31:02.210 --> 00:31:07.980
<v Michael Kennedy>I mean, do you recommend to anyone that they just 100% go full

00:31:08.370 --> 00:31:12.540
<v Michael Kennedy>like C++, C# on it and just type it every single thing?

00:31:13.720 --> 00:31:16.580
<v Michael Kennedy>Is there an advantage for static type checkers,

00:31:17.140 --> 00:31:20.740
<v Michael Kennedy>like mypy type stuff you can run across and get that.

00:31:20.740 --> 00:31:23.200
<v Michael Kennedy>I mean, you could do that with PowerFly or ty and the CLI

00:31:23.200 --> 00:31:23.540
<v Michael Kennedy>as well.

00:31:23.720 --> 00:31:27.360
<v Michael Kennedy>But thinking more mypy is like kind of being real strict

00:31:27.520 --> 00:31:28.200
<v Michael Kennedy>on some of that stuff.

00:31:29.220 --> 00:31:32.000
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>Personally, I do tend to annotate almost all function

00:31:32.260 --> 00:31:35.440
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>parameters and if class attributes, if I make a class.

00:31:37.900 --> 00:31:39.340
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>Sometimes it's not as necessary.

00:31:39.640 --> 00:31:41.900
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>Like you don't need to annotate your tests, perhaps,

00:31:42.200 --> 00:31:44.240
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>or you don't need to annotate internal functions as much.

00:31:45.520 --> 00:31:48.460
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>But for my own coding, I usually find it helpful to do that.

00:31:50.680 --> 00:31:53.520
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>But sometimes I see people annotating even local variables

00:31:53.860 --> 00:31:55.920
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>where it's very obvious to type check what the type is,

00:31:56.220 --> 00:31:57.420
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>and they can just infer it reliably.

00:31:58.190 --> 00:31:59.960
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>And then it really just adds noise,

00:32:00.180 --> 00:32:01.000
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>and you shouldn't do it.

00:32:02.140 --> 00:32:02.840
<v Michael Kennedy>Yeah, exactly.

00:32:02.980 --> 00:32:05.380
<v Michael Kennedy>If you've got a function that's annotated with a return value,

00:32:05.430 --> 00:32:07.760
<v Michael Kennedy>and you say x equals the function call,

00:32:08.380 --> 00:32:09.900
<v Michael Kennedy>then the type checkers can infer that.

00:32:10.100 --> 00:32:14.880
<v Michael Kennedy>And you're just causing extra noise, I guess.

00:32:17.920 --> 00:32:21.420
<v Michael Kennedy>So suppose you all want to change something.

00:32:22.820 --> 00:32:25.860
<v Michael Kennedy>What's the process of actually going through and making some changes?

00:32:30.020 --> 00:32:32.500
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>Yeah, there's mostly sort of two levels of this.

00:32:34.460 --> 00:32:35.600
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>Well, maybe there's even three levels.

00:32:35.740 --> 00:32:40.160
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>The first one is if it's something that's so small that's just like a wording clarification or something,

00:32:40.160 --> 00:32:45.140
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>We just make a PR to the repo and a few of us look at it and we change it.

00:32:45.920 --> 00:32:51.680
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>The second level is when it's sort of a smaller change that doesn't really introduce a new

00:32:51.880 --> 00:32:58.600
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>feature and then we make a PR to the typing spec repo and we formally have all of us sign

00:32:58.600 --> 00:32:59.020
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>off on it.

00:32:59.900 --> 00:33:04.480
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>That's what happens like with what Carl mentioned earlier of the final change in data classes.

00:33:06.660 --> 00:33:07.100
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>Nice.

00:33:10.720 --> 00:33:12.520
<v Michael Kennedy>I just had to merge this one.

00:33:14.980 --> 00:33:15.780
<v Michael Kennedy>I love it.

00:33:16.260 --> 00:33:19.140
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>Yeah, I guess this repo itself doesn't have anything.

00:33:20.740 --> 00:33:24.080
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>It's the Python typing repo where the decisions are made.

00:33:24.840 --> 00:33:28.780
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>The typing council just has some documentation.

00:33:29.880 --> 00:33:30.340
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>Maybe this one.

00:33:30.350 --> 00:33:30.480
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>Yeah.

00:33:30.990 --> 00:33:32.200
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>And then the third level is peps.

00:33:32.270 --> 00:33:33.540
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>Like really big new changes.

00:33:33.650 --> 00:33:34.700
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>You can still write a pep.

00:33:35.420 --> 00:33:38.780
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>And then we make a recommendation in the steering code so it makes a decision eventually.

00:33:39.800 --> 00:33:40.140
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>Okay.

00:33:42.840 --> 00:33:50.240
<v Michael Kennedy>So if I wanted to suggest something, I could come up here and I could open up an issue,

00:33:50.500 --> 00:33:55.080
<v Michael Kennedy>maybe start a conversation on typing, Python/typing.

00:33:56.120 --> 00:33:58.300
<v Carl Meyer>And you can make a pull request to change the spec.

00:33:59.560 --> 00:33:59.660
<v Michael Kennedy>Okay.

00:33:59.920 --> 00:34:07.600
<v Michael Kennedy>and so the pull request would not be to change the code like how python maybe interprets code that

00:34:07.740 --> 00:34:12.899
<v Michael Kennedy>has this new thing but to suggest that the spec has it which then would start a process that

00:34:13.260 --> 00:34:18.480
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>ultimately might make c python understand it right well c python itself probably doesn't do anything

00:34:18.620 --> 00:34:25.020
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>with it um i guess most of the things that go directly here are changes to how to interpret

00:34:25.040 --> 00:34:26.780
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>the things that are already in CPython.

00:34:27.659 --> 00:34:29.659
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>If it's adding something new, it will usually

00:34:29.899 --> 00:34:32.440
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>need to go through a path, except if it's something very small.

00:34:34.380 --> 00:34:37.200
<v Michael Kennedy>Yeah, I guess maybe let's talk about that for a minute.

00:34:37.300 --> 00:34:42.340
<v Michael Kennedy>We got two representatives here of the newer breed of tools.

00:34:44.020 --> 00:34:48.780
<v Michael Kennedy>What's the story for inconsistencies

00:34:50.100 --> 00:34:51.760
<v Michael Kennedy>across interpretations of the spec?

00:34:51.919 --> 00:34:53.280
<v Michael Kennedy>I know that there's slight variations.

00:34:54.520 --> 00:34:58.480
<v Michael Kennedy>I've also, you know, not putting either of you on the spotlight,

00:34:58.760 --> 00:35:04.320
<v Michael Kennedy>but like using, say, PyCharm and like writing code.

00:35:04.320 --> 00:35:09.120
<v Michael Kennedy>So it's type checkers happy and then using something like Pyright.

00:35:09.560 --> 00:35:14.140
<v Michael Kennedy>And so it has a real different interpretation of what you should let slide

00:35:14.140 --> 00:35:14.760
<v Michael Kennedy>and what you shouldn't.

00:35:14.780 --> 00:35:23.040
<v Michael Kennedy>I feel like Pyright is much more focused on like enforcing the nullability

00:35:23.040 --> 00:35:27.720
<v Michael Kennedy>or the lack thereof, and it warns of inconsistencies there

00:35:27.900 --> 00:35:29.460
<v Michael Kennedy>where PyCharm doesn't seem to care as much.

00:35:30.060 --> 00:35:32.120
<v Michael Kennedy>I don't know which one I like better, but I know they're different.

00:35:32.400 --> 00:35:34.160
<v Michael Kennedy>And if I write code in one, then I open the other.

00:35:34.230 --> 00:35:35.680
<v Michael Kennedy>I'm like, huh, why is it upset?

00:35:35.920 --> 00:35:37.040
<v Michael Kennedy>It seemed like it was fine.

00:35:40.020 --> 00:35:40.960
<v Michael Kennedy>How do you all navigate this?

00:35:41.240 --> 00:35:41.300
<v Michael Kennedy>Yeah.

00:35:41.740 --> 00:35:45.260
<v Carl Meyer>I think one thing useful to say about the spec there

00:35:45.290 --> 00:35:48.000
<v Carl Meyer>is that the spec covers a lot of things.

00:35:48.250 --> 00:35:50.440
<v Carl Meyer>In particular, it tends to cover sort of the details

00:35:50.760 --> 00:35:52.500
<v Carl Meyer>of more advanced type system features.

00:35:53.420 --> 00:35:58.940
<v Carl Meyer>but there's a lot of very fundamental stuff about how a type checker works in terms of

00:35:59.620 --> 00:36:04.840
<v Carl Meyer>how it does inference and how it does type narrowing. And even in some cases, like you

00:36:04.960 --> 00:36:10.240
<v Carl Meyer>mentioned, what it chooses to emit errors on that isn't really covered by the spec,

00:36:11.320 --> 00:36:18.540
<v Carl Meyer>partly maybe because we haven't gotten to it and also partly intentionally in that there may be

00:36:18.860 --> 00:36:22.640
<v Carl Meyer>room in some of those cases for different type checkers to work differently if they're serving

00:36:22.660 --> 00:36:29.400
<v Carl Meyer>needs. Like if PyCharm is primarily concerned about being a useful kind of IDE and providing

00:36:29.580 --> 00:36:36.160
<v Carl Meyer>go-to definition and that sort of thing, maybe emitting lots of warnings or errors and all kinds

00:36:36.160 --> 00:36:41.260
<v Carl Meyer>of things where your code might be doing something wrong isn't as high a priority and another type

00:36:41.420 --> 00:36:50.640
<v Rebecca Chen>checker might have a different priority. One thing I want to mention is that it may not

00:36:50.660 --> 00:36:58.280
<v Rebecca Chen>seem like it, but things are already much better than they used to be. Like previously I worked

00:36:58.660 --> 00:37:05.000
<v Rebecca Chen>on different type checker called PyType. And at that time it was, you know, sort of the wild west.

00:37:05.130 --> 00:37:10.480
<v Rebecca Chen>Like we want to know how other type checkers like do something. Well, you know, like open up the mypy

00:37:10.560 --> 00:37:17.539
<v Rebecca Chen>playground, open up the PyRite playground, see what tells you. Now we at least have spec and

00:37:17.560 --> 00:37:27.740
<v Michael Kennedy>conformance tests. Yeah, that's really cool. How much would you say that your two type checkers

00:37:28.380 --> 00:37:34.980
<v Michael Kennedy>maybe bring in mypy as well? How much do they agree versus disagree? You only see the differences.

00:37:35.100 --> 00:37:39.400
<v Michael Kennedy>You don't see in which ways that they are the same as a consumer of them so much, right? You're

00:37:39.480 --> 00:37:45.920
<v Michael Kennedy>like, why is this one squiggly when it wasn't squiggly before? But how similar or different are

00:37:48.280 --> 00:37:53.060
<v Carl Meyer>I don't know how we would quantify that there. I think there's a lot that is the same just because

00:37:53.820 --> 00:37:59.380
<v Carl Meyer>it's based on how Python actually works. We're both trying to model the same language. And then

00:37:59.440 --> 00:38:03.020
<v Carl Meyer>there's certainly also plenty of differences or things that we handle differently. So

00:38:04.880 --> 00:38:15.900
<v Rebecca Chen>quantify that. Yeah. I agree. It's hard to quantify, suppose, talk a bit abstractly about

00:38:15.920 --> 00:38:20.320
<v Rebecca Chen>various like type checkers philosophies like with Pyrefly,

00:38:20.380 --> 00:38:23.100
<v Rebecca Chen>you know, like we really try to do a lot of type inference.

00:38:23.400 --> 00:38:24.840
<v Rebecca Chen>So in that way in which, you know,

00:38:24.940 --> 00:38:27.400
<v Rebecca Chen>like we intentionally diverge a bit from myPy,

00:38:27.640 --> 00:38:30.200
<v Rebecca Chen>but like other than like that deliberate decision,

00:38:30.440 --> 00:38:32.660
<v Rebecca Chen>if we see ways in which we are like accidentally different,

00:38:32.940 --> 00:38:37.000
<v Rebecca Chen>you know, we do try to fix that because otherwise people

00:38:37.060 --> 00:38:39.440
<v Rebecca Chen>would have a hard time like running multiple type checkers

00:38:39.520 --> 00:38:40.000
<v Rebecca Chen>or migrating.

00:38:41.180 --> 00:38:45.200
<v Carl Meyer>- Yeah, differences obviously cause pain for users

00:38:45.220 --> 00:38:46.520
<v Carl Meyer>who are using multiple type checkers

00:38:46.680 --> 00:38:48.240
<v Carl Meyer>or writing libraries that need to support

00:38:48.480 --> 00:38:49.260
<v Carl Meyer>multiple type checkers.

00:38:49.400 --> 00:38:51.020
<v Carl Meyer>So like Rebecca said, it's like,

00:38:51.560 --> 00:38:53.780
<v Carl Meyer>if we are different from other type checkers,

00:38:53.780 --> 00:38:55.160
<v Carl Meyer>we wanna be sure that there's a good reason

00:38:55.800 --> 00:38:56.280
<v Carl Meyer>for that difference.

00:39:02.400 --> 00:39:03.640
<v Carl Meyer>Oh, lost your audio, Michael.

00:39:05.120 --> 00:39:05.760
<v Michael Kennedy>- Right, sorry.

00:39:06.620 --> 00:39:11.100
<v Michael Kennedy>The difference should be because of philosophical choice,

00:39:11.420 --> 00:39:14.800
<v Michael Kennedy>not just you happen to have chosen slightly differently, right?

00:39:18.520 --> 00:39:22.560
<v Michael Kennedy>Yeah, and it's not just people who run different type checkers.

00:39:23.640 --> 00:39:26.340
<v Michael Kennedy>Like you pointed out, Carl, a lot of times it is if I have a library

00:39:27.660 --> 00:39:30.500
<v Michael Kennedy>and then different people want to consume that library,

00:39:30.620 --> 00:39:33.160
<v Michael Kennedy>then their type checker may or may not warn them

00:39:33.400 --> 00:39:36.640
<v Michael Kennedy>about how my library declares its types and so on.

00:39:37.560 --> 00:39:39.520
<v Michael Kennedy>I'll give you a real quick example.

00:39:41.080 --> 00:39:43.800
<v Michael Kennedy>I have a, I can't remember which one it was,

00:39:43.880 --> 00:39:50.960
<v Michael Kennedy>I have three or four different open source libraries that I've created that somehow work with creating,

00:39:51.980 --> 00:39:55.780
<v Michael Kennedy>basically passing data to templates in web apps.

00:39:56.420 --> 00:40:02.220
<v Michael Kennedy>So one is like, I want to use the Chameleon web template framework, but with FastAPI or with Flask.

00:40:02.380 --> 00:40:04.680
<v Michael Kennedy>And there's some other variations like partials and so on.

00:40:04.920 --> 00:40:06.900
<v Michael Kennedy>I can't remember which one, but it doesn't really matter.

00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:10.000
<v Michael Kennedy>One of them decorated a Flask.

00:40:10.520 --> 00:40:12.900
<v Michael Kennedy>I think it was a Flask, especially makes it irrelevant.

00:40:13.040 --> 00:40:21.220
<v Michael Kennedy>a flask endpoint and pyrite was really upset like the error message filled the entire page of how it

00:40:21.280 --> 00:40:27.200
<v Michael Kennedy>was inconsistent with what it expected for the definition of the flask view method i'm like

00:40:27.620 --> 00:40:33.500
<v Michael Kennedy>no one is going to call this like what does it even matter what this type is like it still runs

00:40:33.740 --> 00:40:40.020
<v Michael Kennedy>fine the runtime is fine you know it's no problem with this decorator it worked fine but something

00:40:40.040 --> 00:40:47.360
<v Michael Kennedy>about the way that the flask at get returned the type versus what my thing returned varied in like

00:40:47.360 --> 00:40:54.560
<v Michael Kennedy>a really slight way. I didn't care. But somebody was using some editor that used pyrite and they're

00:40:54.620 --> 00:40:58.880
<v Michael Kennedy>like, you have to help fix this. I can't take all these warnings that are huge and they're everywhere.

00:40:59.120 --> 00:41:06.560
<v Michael Kennedy>Like, okay, I'll go fix it. Right. And I went and I put a way more effort than was justified into a

00:41:06.560 --> 00:41:12.300
<v Michael Kennedy>function type that no one ever calls just to make the errors on some type checker I didn't use

00:41:12.900 --> 00:41:16.220
<v Michael Kennedy>go away, right? And that's the kind of thing where it becomes just a headache.

00:41:19.580 --> 00:41:24.000
<v Michael Kennedy>I don't know. I wish I remember. I probably got that written down in an issue somebody filed,

00:41:24.180 --> 00:41:28.880
<v Michael Kennedy>but it was a gnarly error. Or if you're working on an open source project, you know,

00:41:28.930 --> 00:41:33.840
<v Michael Kennedy>you can't make everybody use the same editor that wants to contribute on a big project.

00:41:34.380 --> 00:41:36.200
<v Michael Kennedy>And so you might run into this variation as well.

00:41:36.260 --> 00:41:37.060
<v Michael Kennedy>So there's a lot of cases.

00:41:40.220 --> 00:41:43.100
<v Carl Meyer>Yeah, it can be really difficult to make these decisions

00:41:43.440 --> 00:41:49.660
<v Carl Meyer>about what sorts of errors people want their type checker

00:41:49.660 --> 00:41:51.620
<v Carl Meyer>to catch or what's too pedantic.

00:41:53.380 --> 00:41:55.080
<v Carl Meyer>Because you want your type checker

00:41:55.080 --> 00:41:59.120
<v Carl Meyer>to catch non-obvious errors, not just the obvious ones

00:41:59.180 --> 00:42:00.800
<v Carl Meyer>that you probably would have seen by looking at the code

00:42:00.900 --> 00:42:01.020
<v Carl Meyer>yourself.

00:42:03.780 --> 00:42:06.120
<v Carl Meyer>But then there'll be cases where somebody says,

00:42:06.120 --> 00:42:07.340
<v Carl Meyer>well, I don't care, that's too pedantic.

00:42:07.560 --> 00:42:10.120
<v Carl Meyer>And it is difficult to make everyone happy.

00:42:11.060 --> 00:42:11.700
<v Michael Kennedy>- Yeah, exactly.

00:42:12.760 --> 00:42:13.960
<v Michael Kennedy>When I was seeing, I'm like, well,

00:42:15.520 --> 00:42:18.480
<v Michael Kennedy>who decides what the right signature

00:42:18.720 --> 00:42:21.440
<v Michael Kennedy>of a flask view and point should be like?

00:42:21.620 --> 00:42:24.500
<v Michael Kennedy>If the framework can call it, it should be okay.

00:42:24.920 --> 00:42:26.900
<v Michael Kennedy>There's not, just 'cause it had a decorator before,

00:42:26.960 --> 00:42:28.820
<v Michael Kennedy>that doesn't mean that's the official structure.

00:42:28.980 --> 00:42:29.300
<v Michael Kennedy>But anyway,

00:42:32.120 --> 00:42:34.800
<v Michael Kennedy>I do think one of the bigger philosophical differences

00:42:35.160 --> 00:42:39.560
<v Michael Kennedy>has to do around this concept of nullability.

00:42:39.910 --> 00:42:42.320
<v Michael Kennedy>Do you guys call it nullability or noneability?

00:42:42.600 --> 00:42:44.820
<v Michael Kennedy>Like, nullability comes from the other languages.

00:42:44.950 --> 00:42:48.340
<v Michael Kennedy>And by that, I mean I can specify that I have an integer.

00:42:48.770 --> 00:42:52.280
<v Michael Kennedy>And in the Python type system, it cannot be set to none,

00:42:52.470 --> 00:42:53.580
<v Michael Kennedy>even though in the runtime it can.

00:42:54.220 --> 00:42:57.560
<v Michael Kennedy>It has to be a concrete int type, unless you

00:42:57.680 --> 00:43:01.240
<v Michael Kennedy>make it a optional int or an int pipe none,

00:43:01.560 --> 00:43:02.880
<v Michael Kennedy>or one of those type things, right?

00:43:03.120 --> 00:43:05.460
<v Michael Kennedy>And how strong that gets enforced

00:43:05.760 --> 00:43:09.000
<v Michael Kennedy>seems to be one of the biggest difference of opinions

00:43:09.700 --> 00:43:10.520
<v Michael Kennedy>that I've seen around.

00:43:10.900 --> 00:43:11.980
<v Michael Kennedy>How do you all think about that?

00:43:15.200 --> 00:43:17.620
<v Carl Meyer>- That's interesting to me that that's your experience

00:43:17.900 --> 00:43:20.640
<v Carl Meyer>because my experience has been that that's actually an area

00:43:20.710 --> 00:43:24.060
<v Carl Meyer>where everyone seems to agree as far as I can tell

00:43:24.660 --> 00:43:26.080
<v Carl Meyer>that these are- - Interesting.

00:43:26.080 --> 00:43:27.420
<v Carl Meyer>- Is an important source of bugs

00:43:27.420 --> 00:43:28.500
<v Carl Meyer>and it's better to catch them.

00:43:28.500 --> 00:43:29.460
<v Carl Meyer>So I think all of the type checkers,

00:43:30.080 --> 00:43:31.500
<v Carl Meyer>Maybe you said PyCharm doesn't?

00:43:31.640 --> 00:43:33.640
<v Michael Kennedy>I don't think PyCharm does that.

00:43:33.840 --> 00:43:38.740
<v Michael Kennedy>I'm pretty sure it doesn't because I

00:43:38.980 --> 00:43:40.840
<v Michael Kennedy>agree that it's an important thing to check,

00:43:41.940 --> 00:43:44.540
<v Michael Kennedy>but it's also a point of a lot of friction.

00:43:45.580 --> 00:43:48.400
<v Michael Kennedy>And by that, I mean, let's suppose

00:43:48.700 --> 00:43:52.740
<v Michael Kennedy>I'm going to have a class that I need to create an instance of

00:43:53.060 --> 00:43:54.600
<v Michael Kennedy>and then put values into.

00:43:55.380 --> 00:43:57.540
<v Michael Kennedy>And I know once I put the values into it,

00:43:57.560 --> 00:43:58.860
<v Michael Kennedy>let's say it has a user ID.

00:43:59.900 --> 00:44:02.840
<v Michael Kennedy>I know for certain that that's going to be an integer.

00:44:03.560 --> 00:44:08.400
<v Michael Kennedy>So I'd like to say userid colon int because everywhere I use that object later,

00:44:09.440 --> 00:44:13.740
<v Michael Kennedy>if it's a function that takes an int and I specify it as optional int,

00:44:15.060 --> 00:44:19.540
<v Michael Kennedy>I will get a type check warning every single call site when I try to pass that.

00:44:20.060 --> 00:44:26.460
<v Michael Kennedy>But I know from the semantics of the behavior that it's going to always be an int

00:44:27.320 --> 00:44:28.760
<v Michael Kennedy>unless it's not initialized.

00:44:29.500 --> 00:44:32.220
<v Michael Kennedy>like in this short period where I want to create it.

00:44:32.270 --> 00:44:33.800
<v Michael Kennedy>So I can't set the type to int.

00:44:33.810 --> 00:44:35.960
<v Michael Kennedy>I have to set to optional int until I've loaded it.

00:44:36.870 --> 00:44:38.500
<v Michael Kennedy>But there's like this, I don't know,

00:44:38.620 --> 00:44:41.380
<v Michael Kennedy>that's the part where I see a lot of it show up

00:44:42.319 --> 00:44:46.320
<v Michael Kennedy>is inconsistencies and then warnings all over the place.

00:44:46.720 --> 00:44:49.060
<v Michael Kennedy>So I'm like, well, but that function is actually checking

00:44:49.130 --> 00:44:52.240
<v Michael Kennedy>if it's none and it'll return null, you know, none

00:44:52.410 --> 00:44:53.120
<v Michael Kennedy>or something like that.

00:44:53.280 --> 00:44:54.460
<v Michael Kennedy>So I don't know.

00:44:54.920 --> 00:44:56.200
<v Michael Kennedy>I totally agree with you.

00:44:56.480 --> 00:45:02.540
<v Michael Kennedy>It's just somewhere I've seen the most inconsistencies across maybe PyCharm versus others.

00:45:03.940 --> 00:45:09.640
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>mypy also has a legacy mode for not checking none things called non-strict optional.

00:45:10.860 --> 00:45:15.700
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>We are trying to get rid of that from mypy because strict optional,

00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:18.000
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>like being strict about it is the more sensible thing to do.

00:45:18.860 --> 00:45:19.000
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>Sure.

00:45:19.180 --> 00:45:21.120
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>But it's possible that you've seen that too.

00:45:21.580 --> 00:45:22.060
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>Yeah, I agree.

00:45:22.320 --> 00:45:29.200
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>So what you mentioned is maybe sort of a special case of the case where you pass something to a class and there's initialization that changes the types.

00:45:30.120 --> 00:45:31.540
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>Doesn't necessarily have to deal with none.

00:45:31.570 --> 00:45:34.480
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>It could also just be like the attribute doesn't exist at the little beforehand or something.

00:45:35.220 --> 00:45:35.360
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>Yeah.

00:45:35.500 --> 00:45:35.720
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>Yeah.

00:45:36.040 --> 00:45:37.660
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>We don't have a good solution for that.

00:45:37.820 --> 00:45:41.400
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>Maybe there's room for something to support that use case better.

00:45:41.720 --> 00:45:42.880
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>I don't know what it would look like.

00:45:44.200 --> 00:45:44.980
<v Carl Meyer>Yeah, I don't know.

00:45:45.240 --> 00:45:54.320
<v Carl Meyer>In some cases, there's ways you can, these things can sometimes nudge you towards a different design that is actually safer and will avoid errors.

00:45:54.540 --> 00:46:03.640
<v Carl Meyer>Like in the kind of case you're talking about, you know, is it actually necessary that an uninitialized object and an initialized one are represented by the same type?

00:46:04.400 --> 00:46:11.660
<v Carl Meyer>Or is there a way to adjust the API so that those are actually different types than you solve the problem and your code is safer?

00:46:11.760 --> 00:46:16.620
<v Michael Kennedy>So yeah, no, I totally hear you.

00:46:16.730 --> 00:46:21.560
<v Michael Kennedy>You know, I'm thinking like you submit a web form and before you,

00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:22.820
<v Michael Kennedy>before you parse it,

00:46:22.860 --> 00:46:24.480
<v Michael Kennedy>you've got to create the instance to set the values.

00:46:26.300 --> 00:46:28.800
<v Michael Kennedy>And I don't know, it's, it's not worth diving into,

00:46:28.880 --> 00:46:33.780
<v Michael Kennedy>but I do find this differentiation between like the strict enforcement of none

00:46:34.030 --> 00:46:36.000
<v Michael Kennedy>versus not none. I think it's powerful.

00:46:36.050 --> 00:46:39.020
<v Michael Kennedy>And I do think you all are right that it does catch a lot of errors. It's just,

00:46:39.120 --> 00:46:42.700
<v Michael Kennedy>It's just a difference, and it's just an interesting choice.

00:46:43.100 --> 00:46:46.240
<v Michael Kennedy>But I didn't get a concrete answer from the official counsel.

00:46:47.160 --> 00:46:48.440
<v Michael Kennedy>Nullable or noneable?

00:46:49.180 --> 00:46:49.540
<v Michael Kennedy>What is it?

00:46:51.140 --> 00:46:53.200
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>I feel like you just don't really even talk about it

00:46:53.220 --> 00:46:53.980
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>as a term, mostly.

00:46:55.860 --> 00:46:59.260
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>None is special in the type system in how you represent it,

00:46:59.440 --> 00:47:02.520
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>but it's not really special in other ways.

00:47:04.180 --> 00:47:06.720
<v Michael Kennedy>So you don't have a term for int type none?

00:47:08.120 --> 00:47:13.780
<v Carl Meyer>to our none. Historically, the term was optional, although I think that term has problems and

00:47:14.540 --> 00:47:20.620
<v Carl Meyer>we're sort of moving away from it because specifically one problem is that optional can

00:47:20.840 --> 00:47:26.960
<v Carl Meyer>mean you don't have to pass it in, like I say, as a function parameter. Right. And that's not

00:47:27.400 --> 00:47:32.240
<v Michael Kennedy>the intention. Yeah. It has two total different meanings there. Interesting.

00:47:34.580 --> 00:47:37.680
<v Michael Kennedy>Let's talk a little bit about TypeShed.

00:47:38.110 --> 00:47:39.840
<v Michael Kennedy>I think TypeShed is pretty interesting.

00:47:40.020 --> 00:47:42.980
<v Michael Kennedy>Maybe people don't know too much about it.

00:47:43.520 --> 00:47:46.240
<v Michael Kennedy>So I'm sure you all are familiar with this project,

00:47:46.350 --> 00:47:50.220
<v Michael Kennedy>that you can basically add type information

00:47:50.500 --> 00:47:53.180
<v Michael Kennedy>that the libraries didn't bother to include for you, right?

00:47:57.240 --> 00:47:58.600
<v Michael Kennedy>What are thoughts on TypeShed?

00:47:58.800 --> 00:48:03.900
<v Michael Kennedy>How much do you all lean on this to round out

00:48:03.920 --> 00:48:04.580
<v Michael Kennedy>missing types?

00:48:07.660 --> 00:48:11.720
<v Rebecca Chen>I mean, there are two parts of types shed, right?

00:48:11.980 --> 00:48:18.380
<v Rebecca Chen>There's the standard library type stubs, which I think are invaluable, like all the type

00:48:19.300 --> 00:48:20.100
<v Rebecca Chen>checkers use those.

00:48:20.540 --> 00:48:24.960
<v Rebecca Chen>And I mean, will the standard library itself ever have inline types?

00:48:25.860 --> 00:48:27.480
<v Rebecca Chen>Who knows, this might be around forever.

00:48:28.300 --> 00:48:32.720
<v Rebecca Chen>Then there are also the third party stubs.

00:48:33.080 --> 00:48:34.860
<v Rebecca Chen>And I think that's what you're describing.

00:48:35.040 --> 00:48:36.700
<v Rebecca Chen>Their libraries that for whatever reason

00:48:36.940 --> 00:48:38.640
<v Rebecca Chen>don't ship with stubs themselves.

00:48:39.200 --> 00:48:41.260
<v Rebecca Chen>Those are in TypeShed.

00:48:42.880 --> 00:48:46.260
<v Rebecca Chen>And it's been like, for a while,

00:48:46.420 --> 00:48:48.260
<v Rebecca Chen>this has been a question of like what we want to do

00:48:49.060 --> 00:48:51.380
<v Rebecca Chen>with like TypeShed third party stubs, right?

00:48:51.680 --> 00:48:54.560
<v Rebecca Chen>'Cause like, ideally like libraries would ship

00:48:54.590 --> 00:48:56.220
<v Rebecca Chen>with their own types,

00:48:56.480 --> 00:48:58.040
<v Rebecca Chen>but there are various obstacles to that.

00:49:00.020 --> 00:49:04.260
<v Michael Kennedy>- You know, the obstacles that I know of used to be like,

00:49:04.920 --> 00:49:07.500
<v Michael Kennedy>we want this to run on Python 2 and Python 3,

00:49:08.100 --> 00:49:10.940
<v Michael Kennedy>or we want it to run on Python 3.3 still.

00:49:12.600 --> 00:49:14.020
<v Michael Kennedy>But it's been a long time

00:49:14.740 --> 00:49:17.680
<v Michael Kennedy>since any non-type supporting version of Python

00:49:20.920 --> 00:49:24.080
<v Michael Kennedy>was a real, you know, a supported type of thing, right?

00:49:25.500 --> 00:49:27.800
<v Michael Kennedy>I mean, even 3.9 became deprecated.

00:49:30.180 --> 00:49:33.880
<v Michael Kennedy>So on one hand, I feel like they could be merged in,

00:49:33.880 --> 00:49:40.180
<v Michael Kennedy>but there's also a lot of other areas that are maybe we don't--

00:49:40.580 --> 00:49:42.360
<v Michael Kennedy>they're not common, right?

00:49:42.540 --> 00:49:49.120
<v Michael Kennedy>Like other libraries like--

00:49:49.700 --> 00:49:49.880
<v Michael Kennedy>I don't know.

00:49:49.920 --> 00:49:51.860
<v Michael Kennedy>Just pick some-- let's say Pyramid.

00:49:52.200 --> 00:49:56.180
<v Michael Kennedy>I don't think the Pyramid Web Framework really ever got types added to it.

00:49:56.980 --> 00:50:00.080
<v Michael Kennedy>Somebody could go and create a type shed stub or

00:50:01.100 --> 00:50:05.180
<v Michael Kennedy>a types_pyramid you could pip install and then we'll add the types, right?

00:50:06.430 --> 00:50:09.920
<v Michael Kennedy>I certainly see it being really valuable for third party things that are just not

00:50:10.020 --> 00:50:12.380
<v Michael Kennedy>going to get the type attention they need.

00:50:20.020 --> 00:50:20.680
<v Michael Kennedy>Yellow, what do you think?

00:50:21.680 --> 00:50:22.620
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>- Yeah, I think TypeShed is great.

00:50:22.880 --> 00:50:25.360
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>I've spent a lot of time on improving it.

00:50:26.660 --> 00:50:28.460
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>As Rebecca said, especially with a standard library,

00:50:28.800 --> 00:50:29.760
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>it's irreplaceable.

00:50:30.880 --> 00:50:31.800
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>For third party libraries,

00:50:32.170 --> 00:50:34.960
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>I think it's become less needed over time.

00:50:36.640 --> 00:50:38.900
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>It used to be that very few third party libraries

00:50:39.200 --> 00:50:39.960
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>had any types.

00:50:40.680 --> 00:50:41.940
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>Now that's obviously changed.

00:50:41.950 --> 00:50:44.680
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>A lot of libraries ship their own types.

00:50:46.580 --> 00:50:49.900
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>But still, there are quite a few types of libraries left

00:50:49.920 --> 00:50:54.520
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>where there aren't inline types and TypeShit can provide useful types.

00:50:55.040 --> 00:50:59.780
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>I think TypeShit also provides a service because it has a really great framework for testing these types.

00:51:00.560 --> 00:51:11.540
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>We have tools like step test and various type checkers that help to make sure these types are good and meet a high standards.

00:51:12.760 --> 00:51:14.820
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>So yeah, I think they're still useful for many libraries.

00:51:15.980 --> 00:51:19.820
<v Michael Kennedy>Yeah, I was just looking at the types-flask,

00:51:20.180 --> 00:51:22.940
<v Michael Kennedy>and I guess it must be gone

00:51:23.090 --> 00:51:25.180
<v Michael Kennedy>because now typeflask must have it internally.

00:51:25.580 --> 00:51:28.120
<v Michael Kennedy>So it's kind of an interim sort of thing.

00:51:28.220 --> 00:51:28.640
<v Michael Kennedy>That's pretty cool.

00:51:28.670 --> 00:51:30.740
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>Yeah, in general, types has a policy

00:51:30.810 --> 00:51:32.380
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>that we remove the steps from typeset

00:51:32.410 --> 00:51:34.460
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>if they are in the library itself.

00:51:35.359 --> 00:51:37.280
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>Yeah, yeah, very cool.

00:51:37.610 --> 00:51:39.600
<v Michael Kennedy>Okay, I find these super valuable

00:51:39.780 --> 00:51:42.540
<v Michael Kennedy>because if there's a library I want to work with

00:51:42.540 --> 00:51:44.720
<v Michael Kennedy>and it just doesn't have types for whatever reason,

00:51:45.100 --> 00:51:48.620
<v Michael Kennedy>You can install stuff from here, and all of a sudden,

00:51:48.630 --> 00:51:50.480
<v Michael Kennedy>your editor's way happier.

00:51:50.800 --> 00:51:55.940
<v Michael Kennedy>I mean, I know you all agreed on the API boundaries,

00:51:56.230 --> 00:51:57.340
<v Michael Kennedy>and I did as well.

00:51:57.350 --> 00:51:58.780
<v Michael Kennedy>It's like that's one of the really cool things.

00:51:58.870 --> 00:52:01.100
<v Michael Kennedy>The other thing that really makes me excited about types

00:52:01.130 --> 00:52:04.660
<v Michael Kennedy>is if I hit dot in my editor, I get

00:52:04.760 --> 00:52:08.260
<v Michael Kennedy>a meaningful list of real information

00:52:08.540 --> 00:52:09.380
<v Michael Kennedy>about what I'm working on.

00:52:09.380 --> 00:52:11.700
<v Michael Kennedy>And so adding these types of things

00:52:11.920 --> 00:52:12.840
<v Michael Kennedy>are pretty interesting.

00:52:13.400 --> 00:52:18.980
<v Michael Kennedy>I want to ask you all about these rogue tools

00:52:19.340 --> 00:52:23.380
<v Michael Kennedy>that do stuff with Python typing that maybe you all didn't intend.

00:52:23.580 --> 00:52:25.380
<v Michael Kennedy>Like we all mentioned Pydantic.

00:52:26.540 --> 00:52:28.260
<v Michael Kennedy>We've got Typer and FastAPI.

00:52:30.380 --> 00:52:33.180
<v Michael Kennedy>But even a little farther out there is BearType.

00:52:33.280 --> 00:52:34.440
<v Michael Kennedy>Are you familiar with BearType?

00:52:36.560 --> 00:52:37.000
<v Carl Meyer>Yeah.

00:52:37.440 --> 00:52:38.800
<v Michael Kennedy>Yeah, BearType's interesting.

00:52:40.340 --> 00:52:44.440
<v Michael Kennedy>You can import-- they have fun.

00:52:45.540 --> 00:52:50.560
<v Michael Kennedy>They have fun with their import names and stuff.

00:52:53.720 --> 00:52:57.140
<v Michael Kennedy>But basically, you can put either a decorator

00:52:57.300 --> 00:53:00.360
<v Michael Kennedy>onto some sort of call site or something,

00:53:00.460 --> 00:53:03.820
<v Michael Kennedy>or you can just do it to an entire package--

00:53:04.020 --> 00:53:04.880
<v Michael Kennedy>or entire modules, rather.

00:53:05.800 --> 00:53:09.720
<v Michael Kennedy>So just from bear type dot claw, import bear type this.

00:53:09.840 --> 00:53:13.180
<v Michael Kennedy>and then it actually turns into runtime type checks.

00:53:15.060 --> 00:53:17.600
<v Michael Kennedy>Good idea, bad idea, interesting.

00:53:18.260 --> 00:53:18.860
<v Michael Kennedy>What do you all think?

00:53:20.600 --> 00:53:23.380
<v Michael Kennedy>So un-Pythonic, you won't even open the web page?

00:53:24.100 --> 00:53:27.460
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>I think people should feel free to write whatever code helps

00:53:27.860 --> 00:53:29.380
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>them make better software.

00:53:30.410 --> 00:53:32.140
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>I haven't really used bar type much myself,

00:53:32.500 --> 00:53:34.040
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>but clearly useful for some people.

00:53:35.560 --> 00:53:37.700
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>And I think in general, in designing a type system,

00:53:37.900 --> 00:53:40.660
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>We should try to accommodate all users who do useful things

00:53:40.760 --> 00:53:41.340
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>for the type system.

00:53:42.900 --> 00:53:44.960
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>And that includes things like Pydantic or BearType.

00:53:48.020 --> 00:53:49.500
<v Michael Kennedy>Yeah, it's pretty fast.

00:53:49.720 --> 00:53:53.920
<v Michael Kennedy>It's not as big of a hit as you would imagine.

00:53:54.940 --> 00:53:55.320
<v Michael Kennedy>Let me see.

00:53:55.380 --> 00:54:00.900
<v Michael Kennedy>What are they-- somewhere they had a really fun saying in here.

00:54:01.060 --> 00:54:02.340
<v Michael Kennedy>But here we go.

00:54:03.000 --> 00:54:06.380
<v Michael Kennedy>BearType brings Rust C++-inspired zero-cost abstractions

00:54:06.400 --> 00:54:09.100
<v Michael Kennedy>into the lawless world of dynamically typed Python

00:54:09.240 --> 00:54:12.160
<v Michael Kennedy>by enforcing type safety at the granular level of functions

00:54:12.420 --> 00:54:15.200
<v Michael Kennedy>and methods against type hints standardized

00:54:15.540 --> 00:54:16.480
<v Michael Kennedy>by the Python community.

00:54:16.660 --> 00:54:19.520
<v Michael Kennedy>And order one, non-amortize worst case time

00:54:19.660 --> 00:54:20.860
<v Michael Kennedy>with negligible constant factors.

00:54:21.080 --> 00:54:21.660
<v Michael Kennedy>Like how about that?

00:54:24.880 --> 00:54:26.740
<v Michael Kennedy>No, it's a pretty neat library and it's pretty fast.

00:54:27.120 --> 00:54:28.780
<v Michael Kennedy>Honestly, I've never used it in production.

00:54:30.260 --> 00:54:33.880
<v Michael Kennedy>Having type hints and squigglies in the editors

00:54:33.880 --> 00:54:37.000
<v Michael Kennedy>or in the linters has always been enough for me.

00:54:37.140 --> 00:54:40.480
<v Michael Kennedy>But I can see using this if it's really critical

00:54:40.740 --> 00:54:41.800
<v Michael Kennedy>and you're having issues, maybe you

00:54:41.880 --> 00:54:43.300
<v Michael Kennedy>want to catch some runtime errors.

00:54:43.840 --> 00:54:44.160
<v Michael Kennedy>I don't know.

00:54:45.900 --> 00:54:48.240
<v Michael Kennedy>It's not quite an endorsement, but it sure is like, huh,

00:54:48.540 --> 00:54:50.700
<v Michael Kennedy>that's different type of thing.

00:54:51.020 --> 00:54:56.940
<v Carl Meyer>I definitely think that the extent to which type checkers

00:54:59.260 --> 00:55:01.580
<v Carl Meyer>may have a different understanding of your code

00:55:01.590 --> 00:55:02.640
<v Carl Meyer>from what happens at runtime.

00:55:03.100 --> 00:55:06.100
<v Carl Meyer>and there isn't anything built in to catch that

00:55:06.260 --> 00:55:07.800
<v Carl Meyer>is sometimes a pain point.

00:55:08.230 --> 00:55:10.380
<v Carl Meyer>And so the desire to have your type annotations,

00:55:10.910 --> 00:55:13.180
<v Carl Meyer>to find out at runtime if your type annotations

00:55:13.230 --> 00:55:14.140
<v Carl Meyer>are telling you a lie,

00:55:14.880 --> 00:55:17.940
<v Carl Meyer>it makes a lot of sense why people would like that.

00:55:18.660 --> 00:55:20.780
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>I mean, it's something you get used to from other languages

00:55:20.870 --> 00:55:22.580
<v Michael Kennedy>where the type checker is built into the compiler.

00:55:22.660 --> 00:55:23.020
<v Michael Kennedy>- Right, right.

00:55:23.160 --> 00:55:24.800
<v Michael Kennedy>You get like a runtime typecast.

00:55:24.980 --> 00:55:27.600
<v Michael Kennedy>Like cannot, you know, we kind of get that

00:55:27.700 --> 00:55:30.860
<v Michael Kennedy>if you try to parse a thing, you know,

00:55:31.000 --> 00:55:33.440
<v Michael Kennedy>like put the int param around a string,

00:55:33.550 --> 00:55:35.920
<v Michael Kennedy>and it's not really a parsable as an int.

00:55:36.660 --> 00:55:39.100
<v Michael Kennedy>But for real type information, I think personally,

00:55:39.250 --> 00:55:42.560
<v Michael Kennedy>I would use this as like I might apply types,

00:55:43.510 --> 00:55:49.460
<v Michael Kennedy>type checking to a module for debugging and development

00:55:49.550 --> 00:55:50.680
<v Michael Kennedy>for a minute and just see what happens,

00:55:50.810 --> 00:55:51.680
<v Michael Kennedy>and then turn it back off.

00:55:52.000 --> 00:55:54.700
<v Michael Kennedy>I don't know that I'd just ship production code that way.

00:55:55.940 --> 00:55:58.740
<v Michael Kennedy>But anyway, I got a couple more questions.

00:55:58.940 --> 00:56:00.240
<v Michael Kennedy>We're getting shorter on time here.

00:56:02.240 --> 00:56:03.800
<v Michael Kennedy>What was one of the harder questions

00:56:04.700 --> 00:56:07.120
<v Michael Kennedy>that you all-- harder decisions you all

00:56:07.120 --> 00:56:10.340
<v Michael Kennedy>had to address on the council?

00:56:12.420 --> 00:56:16.880
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>I think the most contentious one was PEP724,

00:56:17.520 --> 00:56:18.740
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>if I remember the number correctly.

00:56:19.820 --> 00:56:22.440
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>We've just around a feature called type guards,

00:56:22.640 --> 00:56:25.200
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>which is around user-defined type narrowing functions.

00:56:27.340 --> 00:56:31.720
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>We initially defined that in a way that later was found to be somewhat problematic,

00:56:31.980 --> 00:56:35.980
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>and we basically came up with a better set of proposed semantics

00:56:37.440 --> 00:56:40.700
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>that maybe we should have done the first time around.

00:56:41.860 --> 00:56:44.940
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>And what this PEP proposed, and as you can see, I sponsored it,

00:56:45.420 --> 00:56:48.720
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>is that we basically changed the meaning of the existing type cards

00:56:49.040 --> 00:56:52.900
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>under certain conditions, which, yeah.

00:56:53.920 --> 00:56:55.220
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>What is a type card?

00:56:55.720 --> 00:56:58.720
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>A type card is a function, like there's a good example there, the isiterable.

00:56:59.280 --> 00:57:02.860
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>It's a function that tells you how to narrow something.

00:57:03.840 --> 00:57:06.960
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>So in this example, there's an isiterable type card,

00:57:07.340 --> 00:57:09.960
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>which narrows an object to an iterable of anything.

00:57:11.080 --> 00:57:15.500
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>And then inside defunc there, you can see if isiterable file,

00:57:16.180 --> 00:57:18.540
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>it knows that it's an iterable.

00:57:19.140 --> 00:57:23.620
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>And in this case, yeah, I guess it just narrows exactly to iterable any.

00:57:24.140 --> 00:57:26.000
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>That's one of the ways that type cards works.

00:57:26.780 --> 00:57:27.400
<v Michael Kennedy>I see.

00:57:27.540 --> 00:57:30.960
<v Michael Kennedy>And the type that returns kind of communicates to the type system

00:57:31.230 --> 00:57:36.380
<v Michael Kennedy>like that this function ensures that the thing that came in

00:57:36.430 --> 00:57:38.960
<v Michael Kennedy>as an arbitrary object, in fact, is one of these.

00:57:39.420 --> 00:57:39.640
<v Michael Kennedy>Yeah.

00:57:40.300 --> 00:57:41.040
<v Michael Kennedy>Okay, interesting.

00:57:42.800 --> 00:57:44.520
<v Michael Kennedy>Yeah, so that was a tricky one, huh?

00:57:45.760 --> 00:57:45.980
<v Michael Kennedy>Yeah.

00:57:48.000 --> 00:57:49.800
<v Michael Kennedy>Any other standout, Rebecca or Carl?

00:57:50.960 --> 00:57:52.259
<v Carl Meyer>Well, the current discussion around

00:57:52.280 --> 00:57:53.880
<v Carl Meyer>what is the meaning of a float annotation?

00:57:54.960 --> 00:57:57.060
<v Carl Meyer>Still unresolved contentious topic.

00:57:57.540 --> 00:57:58.520
<v Michael Kennedy>Okay, gotcha.

00:58:00.520 --> 00:58:07.980
<v Rebecca Chen>I mean, this on PEP724 is also what came to my mind immediately as well

00:58:08.140 --> 00:58:10.440
<v Rebecca Chen>because this was challenging discussion

00:58:10.880 --> 00:58:15.660
<v Rebecca Chen>because there were very conflicting considerations at play.

00:58:15.840 --> 00:58:20.079
<v Rebecca Chen>It's like what semantics did we want in the long term

00:58:20.100 --> 00:58:22.740
<v Rebecca Chen>and what did we want the type system to look like,

00:58:22.900 --> 00:58:24.280
<v Rebecca Chen>you know, say like 10 years from now

00:58:24.580 --> 00:58:25.820
<v Rebecca Chen>versus backwards compatibility

00:58:26.880 --> 00:58:28.700
<v Rebecca Chen>and what the migration story would look like.

00:58:28.740 --> 00:58:31.120
<v Rebecca Chen>It was quite tricky.

00:58:31.360 --> 00:58:32.900
<v Michael Kennedy>Yeah, I guess that's something

00:58:32.980 --> 00:58:35.920
<v Michael Kennedy>you will always have to be cognizant of

00:58:36.000 --> 00:58:38.640
<v Michael Kennedy>is like every change,

00:58:38.940 --> 00:58:39.980
<v Michael Kennedy>even if it's an improvement,

00:58:40.380 --> 00:58:45.700
<v Michael Kennedy>has to justify the fact that now you have challenges

00:58:46.120 --> 00:58:48.680
<v Michael Kennedy>with the version history over time.

00:58:49.320 --> 00:58:55.100
<v Michael Kennedy>I'm thinking like dict of string comma int with a capital or lowercase d.

00:58:56.480 --> 00:59:00.440
<v Michael Kennedy>I've got people, I did a YouTube video showing something with the lowercase version

00:59:00.530 --> 00:59:03.780
<v Michael Kennedy>because I was using something super modern like Python 3.11.

00:59:05.160 --> 00:59:09.600
<v Michael Kennedy>And I got a message like, hey, Michael, you don't know how to write Python.

00:59:09.710 --> 00:59:10.600
<v Michael Kennedy>Your code is broken.

00:59:11.480 --> 00:59:13.640
<v Michael Kennedy>This code that you wrote just doesn't even run.

00:59:13.710 --> 00:59:14.700
<v Michael Kennedy>I don't know how this is.

00:59:14.840 --> 00:59:17.600
<v Michael Kennedy>I'm like, what version of Python is in?

00:59:17.750 --> 00:59:18.160
<v Michael Kennedy>3.8.

00:59:18.620 --> 00:59:19.920
<v Michael Kennedy>Nope, you can't use 3A for that.

00:59:20.020 --> 00:59:21.020
<v Michael Kennedy>You're going to need to get a newer one.

00:59:21.050 --> 00:59:21.580
<v Michael Kennedy>You know what I mean?

00:59:21.990 --> 00:59:26.120
<v Michael Kennedy>But those are complexities that get added to Python

00:59:26.470 --> 00:59:27.440
<v Michael Kennedy>because of that.

00:59:27.520 --> 00:59:30.480
<v Michael Kennedy>Now you've got two ways to specify what a dict is.

00:59:30.820 --> 00:59:32.860
<v Michael Kennedy>There's a preferred new way, but there's still the old way.

00:59:32.890 --> 00:59:35.740
<v Michael Kennedy>And it just sort of piles up.

00:59:36.299 --> 00:59:38.720
<v Carl Meyer>And it's very hard to ever actually get rid of the old way,

00:59:38.870 --> 00:59:40.420
<v Carl Meyer>even if there's no good reason to use it anymore.

00:59:40.960 --> 00:59:41.320
<v Michael Kennedy>Exactly.

00:59:41.620 --> 00:59:44.600
<v Michael Kennedy>Once it's there, it's written in ink pretty much, right?

00:59:44.780 --> 00:59:47.520
<v Michael Kennedy>Like we have five or six different ways to format strings.

00:59:47.760 --> 00:59:49.620
<v Michael Kennedy>maybe with t-strings at six now.

00:59:51.900 --> 00:59:53.480
<v Michael Kennedy>They're all gonna still be there, right?

00:59:53.500 --> 00:59:55.520
<v Michael Kennedy>So every change, every decision you make

00:59:55.540 --> 00:59:58.780
<v Michael Kennedy>is not just a matter of, is it the right decision, right?

00:59:58.900 --> 01:00:01.980
<v Michael Kennedy>It's the, is it worth it, I'm sure.

01:00:06.760 --> 01:00:08.920
<v Michael Kennedy>Yeah, I don't know, how do you all balance that?

01:00:09.060 --> 01:00:10.560
<v Michael Kennedy>Like, that's tricky.

01:00:16.040 --> 01:00:20.880
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>With things like the big change, at least we know we're moving towards better states.

01:00:21.200 --> 01:00:24.860
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>And there's two things, but they mean exactly the same thing.

01:00:25.160 --> 01:00:27.660
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>So the confusion is not as bad.

01:00:28.700 --> 01:00:33.720
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>The problem with type card is that we're going to change how some existing thing works, like

01:00:33.840 --> 01:00:34.320
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>what it meant.

01:00:35.700 --> 01:00:38.400
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>And I think there are good reasons that maybe that was the right thing to do.

01:00:38.740 --> 01:00:43.699
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>But it would also have been pretty confusing for people if their existing types suddenly

01:00:43.720 --> 01:00:52.740
<v Michael Kennedy>started meaning something completely different yeah absolutely hence float okay all right let's

01:00:52.880 --> 01:01:02.180
<v Michael Kennedy>let's uh do what's coming next like 315 316 do you all have things that are in the works that

01:01:02.180 --> 01:01:10.220
<v Michael Kennedy>you think are going to come or debates that are brewing i think for 315 the there's a type dict

01:01:10.200 --> 01:01:16.260
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>feature coming, extra items. You can already use it in typing extensions if you want to use it,

01:01:16.600 --> 01:01:23.360
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>but it will be in CPython as of 2.15. It's likely we'll have a small thing I added called

01:01:23.560 --> 01:01:28.120
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>disjoint basis, which is very technical, but helps type narrowing in some cases.

01:01:30.670 --> 01:01:36.140
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>Yeah, I think those are the things that are likely to make it. We can only speculate about

01:01:36.120 --> 01:01:37.280
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>but what else people can propose,

01:01:37.450 --> 01:01:39.840
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>we're sort of bound by what people actually write up as peps.

01:01:41.680 --> 01:01:42.940
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>We have to wait for people to write the peps

01:01:43.030 --> 01:01:43.840
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>before we can approve them.

01:01:45.780 --> 01:01:48.360
<v Carl Meyer>I think there's  PEP 747 for type form,

01:01:48.660 --> 01:01:52.080
<v Carl Meyer>which I think we recommended its acceptance,

01:01:52.320 --> 01:01:54.320
<v Carl Meyer>but I don't think the steering council accepted it yet,

01:01:54.480 --> 01:01:55.640
<v Carl Meyer>or it hasn't been accepted formally.

01:01:56.220 --> 01:01:57.160
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>I think that's right.

01:01:57.730 --> 01:01:59.160
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>I think that's on their plate.

01:01:59.270 --> 01:02:02.680
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>Yeah, so that's also pretty likely to make it into 3.15.

01:02:04.640 --> 01:02:04.800
<v Carl Meyer>Okay.

01:02:05.460 --> 01:02:10.920
<v Carl Meyer>So this is one example of a case that will be pretty useful to people working with type

01:02:11.140 --> 01:02:17.820
<v Carl Meyer>annotations at runtime because it'll allow you to... It's sort of a meta thing where you can annotate,

01:02:18.700 --> 01:02:21.400
<v Carl Meyer>have a type annotation that describes another type annotation.

01:02:22.670 --> 01:02:25.940
<v Carl Meyer>So it's useful if you're writing code that works with type annotations.

01:02:26.920 --> 01:02:31.560
<v Michael Kennedy>Sure. Okay. Make the peidantics of the world very happy.

01:02:33.600 --> 01:02:37.580
<v Rebecca Chen>I am actually pretty excited about type form

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:39.640
<v Rebecca Chen>because I feel like there's a gap

01:02:39.680 --> 01:02:41.260
<v Rebecca Chen>and we can express in the type system.

01:02:41.860 --> 01:02:42.080
<v Rebecca Chen>Yeah.

01:02:42.380 --> 01:02:43.280
<v Rebecca Chen>And we good.

01:02:43.800 --> 01:02:46.840
<v Carl Meyer>And there are cases in the existing type system,

01:02:47.040 --> 01:02:48.520
<v Carl Meyer>like for instance, the cast function

01:02:49.140 --> 01:02:53.100
<v Carl Meyer>and some other cases where something takes any type

01:02:53.300 --> 01:02:54.520
<v Carl Meyer>expression as an argument.

01:02:54.560 --> 01:02:57.100
<v Carl Meyer>We actually don't have a good way to annotate that today.

01:02:57.140 --> 01:02:59.040
<v Carl Meyer>And this will provide a nice way to express that.

01:03:00.400 --> 01:03:00.880
<v Michael Kennedy>Yeah.

01:03:01.480 --> 01:03:02.020
<v Michael Kennedy>OK, cool.

01:03:03.240 --> 01:03:05.860
<v Michael Kennedy>Let me pull up one thing really quick.

01:03:10.460 --> 01:03:11.940
<v Michael Kennedy>Quick shout out to Will McGuggan here.

01:03:11.990 --> 01:03:15.800
<v Michael Kennedy>He just released his Toad project, which is the new--

01:03:16.840 --> 01:03:19.420
<v Michael Kennedy>takes textual and rich and all that kind of stuff

01:03:19.620 --> 01:03:21.460
<v Michael Kennedy>and applies it to like, what if we had a better

01:03:21.760 --> 01:03:23.880
<v Michael Kennedy>cloud code type of experience, which is pretty interesting.

01:03:26.020 --> 01:03:27.960
<v Michael Kennedy>So the reason I bring this up is--

01:03:29.160 --> 01:03:29.820
<v Michael Kennedy>final question.

01:03:30.220 --> 01:03:39.400
<v Michael Kennedy>What about, do you all even worry about the role of like how types interact with AI and agentic coding tools?

01:03:40.940 --> 01:03:46.640
<v Michael Kennedy>I know that if you have some code that has types on it and you give it to an AI,

01:03:47.100 --> 01:03:52.120
<v Michael Kennedy>it's got a better chance of understanding what's happening than if you give it purely untyped code and say,

01:03:53.180 --> 01:03:54.140
<v Michael Kennedy>tell me about this, right?

01:03:54.250 --> 01:03:56.380
<v Michael Kennedy>It doesn't even know necessarily what's being passed to it.

01:03:57.360 --> 01:03:59.540
<v Michael Kennedy>But is that anything you'll think about

01:03:59.610 --> 01:04:01.800
<v Michael Kennedy>or what are your thoughts on this?

01:04:05.220 --> 01:04:06.460
<v Carl Meyer>- Certainly think about it some.

01:04:06.570 --> 01:04:09.620
<v Carl Meyer>I mean, I think overall my feeling is that

01:04:10.400 --> 01:04:12.280
<v Carl Meyer>these coding agents seem to do better

01:04:12.390 --> 01:04:15.800
<v Carl Meyer>the more kind of the tighter feedback loops

01:04:15.830 --> 01:04:17.140
<v Carl Meyer>you can give them to work with.

01:04:17.380 --> 01:04:19.740
<v Carl Meyer>And so typing is another useful source of feedback

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:23.480
<v Carl Meyer>where you can say add type annotations

01:04:23.510 --> 01:04:25.920
<v Carl Meyer>and make sure the type checker passes and seems.

01:04:26.260 --> 01:04:28.520
<v Carl Meyer>So it still seems pretty useful in that world.

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:31.420
<v Michael Kennedy>Yeah, you can easily write rules that say,

01:04:31.860 --> 01:04:34.140
<v Michael Kennedy>when you are done on anything I've asked you to do,

01:04:34.820 --> 01:04:37.580
<v Michael Kennedy>always run ty or always run Pyrefly

01:04:37.680 --> 01:04:40.900
<v Michael Kennedy>and make sure that there's no new errors or at least--

01:04:41.280 --> 01:04:42.360
<v Michael Kennedy>ideally, zero errors, right?

01:04:43.100 --> 01:04:44.340
<v Michael Kennedy>But nothing has been introduced.

01:04:45.440 --> 01:04:45.940
<v Michael Kennedy>Yeah, pretty interesting.

01:04:47.360 --> 01:04:48.320
<v Michael Kennedy>Other folks?

01:04:48.500 --> 01:04:49.400
<v Michael Kennedy>Rebecca, Yella?

01:04:53.780 --> 01:04:55.239
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>Yeah, I guess in general, I think

01:04:55.260 --> 01:04:57.740
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>Typing will remain useful for AI.

01:04:58.260 --> 01:04:59.840
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>We are probably rapidly moving to a world

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:03.080
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>where a large proportion of all code is written by AI.

01:05:05.440 --> 01:05:05.840
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>And--

01:05:06.600 --> 01:05:08.120
<v Michael Kennedy>Not everybody likes that opinion.

01:05:08.260 --> 01:05:09.060
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>Not everybody likes that.

01:05:09.460 --> 01:05:12.140
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>I guess maybe my current line of work makes me

01:05:12.320 --> 01:05:13.380
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>think that's more likely to happen.

01:05:14.160 --> 01:05:16.400
<v Michael Kennedy>Though, I mean, it's also--

01:05:17.860 --> 01:05:20.300
<v Michael Kennedy>you don't have to like the fact it's going to be night soon.

01:05:20.500 --> 01:05:21.200
<v Michael Kennedy>But it's going to be night--

01:05:21.200 --> 01:05:21.600
<v Michael Kennedy>you know what I mean?

01:05:23.220 --> 01:05:25.640
<v Michael Kennedy>I just think there's so much momentum on this,

01:05:25.760 --> 01:05:27.600
<v Michael Kennedy>at least in the next five years or something,

01:05:27.760 --> 01:05:28.680
<v Michael Kennedy>that it's going to be really--

01:05:28.740 --> 01:05:31.700
<v Michael Kennedy>it's a truth of how many people are writing code

01:05:31.920 --> 01:05:34.660
<v Michael Kennedy>regardless of whether individuals want to write code that way.

01:05:34.860 --> 01:05:35.240
<v Michael Kennedy>You know what I mean?

01:05:35.320 --> 01:05:36.280
<v Michael Kennedy>So I think it's a consideration.

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:37.180
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>Yeah.

01:05:38.220 --> 01:05:40.960
<v Michael Kennedy>Yeah, I forgot that you worked at OpenAI, so of course--

01:05:42.180 --> 01:05:44.880
<v Michael Kennedy>I should pull up a codex example or something, shouldn't I?

01:05:45.940 --> 01:05:47.060
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>Yeah, codex is great.

01:05:47.260 --> 01:05:47.520
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>Use it.

01:05:50.640 --> 01:05:55.720
<v Michael Kennedy>No, but I mean, do you have any further insight into the role of types and coding agents?

01:05:56.400 --> 01:05:58.120
<v Michael Kennedy>I know that's not exactly what you work on, right?

01:05:58.340 --> 01:06:00.200
<v Michael Kennedy>Yeah, it's not too much, really.

01:06:00.340 --> 01:06:06.560
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>I think, as Carl said, types can also be helpful for AI to understand code better and to get a better feedback loop.

01:06:08.920 --> 01:06:11.480
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>I feel like the better we make AI, the more it is like humans.

01:06:11.940 --> 01:06:19.460
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>And if typing makes humans better at writing and understanding this code, they'll probably also make AI better at it.

01:06:20.080 --> 01:06:21.740
<v Michael Kennedy>Yeah, it's the locality of information.

01:06:21.850 --> 01:06:26.440
<v Michael Kennedy>You can read the function and know everything you need to know about what's going into it

01:06:26.620 --> 01:06:30.940
<v Michael Kennedy>without bouncing around and trying to understand blocks of code and like what might have been

01:06:31.110 --> 01:06:31.880
<v Michael Kennedy>created that's getting passed.

01:06:32.980 --> 01:06:35.580
<v Michael Kennedy>It's good for humans and also good for AI, right?

01:06:36.300 --> 01:06:36.560
<v Michael Kennedy>Rebecca?

01:06:38.500 --> 01:06:46.479
<v Rebecca Chen>I mean, I guess I don't have much need to, I'll say I am maybe a little more skeptical

01:06:46.500 --> 01:06:51.960
<v Rebecca Chen>than most of my coworkers about the quality of AI generated code.

01:06:52.220 --> 01:06:56.200
<v Rebecca Chen>But that means I think I am particularly gung-ho about,

01:06:56.440 --> 01:07:00.460
<v Rebecca Chen>you know, like get AI to use types, type checkers,

01:07:00.960 --> 01:07:02.960
<v Rebecca Chen>keep the guardrails there.

01:07:03.240 --> 01:07:04.020
<v Rebecca Chen>I think that'd be very important.

01:07:04.020 --> 01:07:05.100
<v Michael Kennedy>- Yeah, if it's gonna make a mistake,

01:07:05.440 --> 01:07:08.380
<v Michael Kennedy>don't let it at least like make the type system become

01:07:08.840 --> 01:07:10.320
<v Michael Kennedy>disconnected and not working.

01:07:10.560 --> 01:07:12.620
<v Michael Kennedy>Like it has to keep the types hanging together

01:07:12.820 --> 01:07:13.920
<v Michael Kennedy>as a minimum bar, right?

01:07:13.920 --> 01:07:15.880
<v Michael Kennedy>And you can easily set that up as an automation.

01:07:18.340 --> 01:07:21.700
<v Michael Kennedy>Yeah, interesting to think of it as guardrails rather than an accelerant.

01:07:21.880 --> 01:07:23.080
<v Michael Kennedy>But yeah, 100% it is.

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:26.580
<v Michael Kennedy>All right, folks.

01:07:26.940 --> 01:07:29.080
<v Michael Kennedy>I think that's it for all the time that we have.

01:07:29.640 --> 01:07:29.860
<v Michael Kennedy>Thank you.

01:07:29.960 --> 01:07:30.680
<v Michael Kennedy>Thank you for being here.

01:07:31.900 --> 01:07:33.680
<v Michael Kennedy>Final thoughts before we go.

01:07:35.380 --> 01:07:36.180
<v Michael Kennedy>Carl, I'll let you go first.

01:07:36.620 --> 01:07:38.560
<v Michael Kennedy>Final thoughts for people out there interested in Python typing.

01:07:39.580 --> 01:07:42.200
<v Carl Meyer>Yeah, well, first of all, thanks for having us on the podcast.

01:07:42.460 --> 01:07:43.200
<v Carl Meyer>Really appreciate it.

01:07:44.580 --> 01:07:46.000
<v Carl Meyer>And thoughts for people out there.

01:07:46.960 --> 01:08:00.900
<v Carl Meyer>I guess if you have ideas of how Python typing could be improved, discuss.python.org is a good place to bring up ideas and discuss them with the typing community and see what positive changes we can make.

01:08:03.079 --> 01:08:04.280
<v Michael Kennedy>Awesome. Rebecca?

01:08:06.400 --> 01:08:10.260
<v Rebecca Chen>Yeah, first, thank you, Michael. This is a lot of fun.

01:08:11.980 --> 01:08:25.940
<v Rebecca Chen>Last thoughts. So, you know, like, look at the typing council and sometimes think, oh, you know, like the PEP has like governance in its name, but I wouldn't say we're really a governing body or anything.

01:08:26.299 --> 01:08:32.040
<v Rebecca Chen>It's like people who are using the type system, like users, they're the ones who come up with,

01:08:32.080 --> 01:08:35.200
<v Rebecca Chen>you know, like all the best ideas, propose them, discuss them.

01:08:35.400 --> 01:08:43.380
<v Rebecca Chen>And we're just here to sort of be like, hey, you know, like we have some background and

01:08:43.460 --> 01:08:47.279
<v Rebecca Chen>like how type checkers work and maybe some of the history and we can provide input.

01:08:47.680 --> 01:08:51.240
<v Rebecca Chen>But I just encourage people, if there's a change you want to see in the type system,

01:08:52.040 --> 01:08:54.060
<v Rebecca Chen>you know, like propose it yourself.

01:08:54.240 --> 01:08:56.339
<v Rebecca Chen>It's very friendly and open community.

01:08:56.720 --> 01:09:00.640
<v Michael Kennedy>Yeah, now people who have listened know a little bit more about how to do so.

01:09:00.970 --> 01:09:01.060
<v Michael Kennedy>Awesome.

01:09:01.400 --> 01:09:01.460
<v Michael Kennedy>Thanks.

01:09:02.080 --> 01:09:02.819
<v Michael Kennedy>Jale, final word.

01:09:03.520 --> 01:09:05.380
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>Also, again, thank you for having me here.

01:09:06.060 --> 01:09:07.240
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>It's been great talking to all of you.

01:09:08.370 --> 01:09:10.640
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>I guess what I want to say is similar to what Karo and Rebecca just said.

01:09:11.759 --> 01:09:16.339
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>If you want to say something changes to the type system, I'd really encourage you to sign

01:09:17.190 --> 01:09:20.259
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>up for discuss.python.org, make a proposal, go through the process.

01:09:20.799 --> 01:09:23.420
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>can be somewhat daunting perhaps, especially if you have to

01:09:24.140 --> 01:09:27.380
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>read a pep, but it is doable. There are several recent typing

01:09:27.580 --> 01:09:31.720
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>peps have just been community members who saw something they

01:09:31.839 --> 01:09:35.960
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>wanted to improve, proposed a  PEP and saw it to completion. If

01:09:36.060 --> 01:09:38.560
<v Jelle Zıjlstra>there's something you want to see in the type system, then you

01:09:38.560 --> 01:09:43.940
<v Michael Kennedy>can do it too. Okay, awesome. Well, thank you all for keeping

01:09:44.100 --> 01:09:47.020
<v Michael Kennedy>Python typing going strong. Really appreciate your time on

01:09:47.020 --> 01:09:48.380
<v Michael Kennedy>the show. See you later.

01:09:51.960 --> 01:09:52.080
<v Michael Kennedy>Bye.

01:09:52.580 --> 01:09:53.060
<v Carl Meyer>Bye.
