1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:02,460
Speaker 1: Dan, welcome to Talk Python To Me.

2
00:00:02,650 --> 00:00:03,180
Speaker 1: Great to have you here.

3
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:03,780
Speaker 2: Hello, hello.

4
00:00:04,150 --> 00:00:05,140
Speaker 2: I'm excited to be here.

5
00:00:05,390 --> 00:00:07,840
Speaker 2: I'm a big fan of Talk Python, I'm a big fan of you,

6
00:00:07,870 --> 00:00:08,800
Speaker 2: and I'm a big fan of Python.

7
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:10,520
Speaker 2: So there we go.

8
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:11,740
Speaker 1: Wow, thank you.

9
00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:13,340
Speaker 1: Thank you, and thank you.

10
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:15,780
Speaker 1: Yes, and on Python's behalf as well, thanks.

11
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:17,640
Speaker 1: No, it's great to be here.

12
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:21,260
Speaker 1: I've been on your show, WorkItem, which was really fun.

13
00:00:21,590 --> 00:00:22,380
Speaker 1: Thank you for having me.

14
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:26,060
Speaker 1: And now it's time to dive into your expertise.

15
00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:33,780
Speaker 1: We're going to talk agentic stuff, and especially we're going to talk model context protocol, MCP.

16
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:40,460
Speaker 1: I think this is one of the really important layers that is kind of invisible, right?

17
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:48,500
Speaker 1: A lot of the coding agents and coding AI and chat LLMs and all that, that's what people think when they hear all these things.

18
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:52,560
Speaker 1: But there's got to be plumbing, right?

19
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:53,500
Speaker 1: There has to be.

20
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:55,760
Speaker 1: Nothing is more amazing than plumbing.

21
00:00:56,020 --> 00:00:57,320
Speaker 1: We all get excited about plumbing.

22
00:00:57,980 --> 00:00:58,800
Speaker 2: I know.

23
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:00,380
Speaker 1: Technology plumbing is cool.

24
00:01:01,910 --> 00:01:02,040
Speaker 2: Yeah.

25
00:01:02,380 --> 00:01:05,440
Speaker 2: It's one of those things, too, that look at how fast it grew.

26
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:06,520
Speaker 2: Think about it.

27
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:11,780
Speaker 2: Last year at this time, at the time when we were recording the work item episode, MCP did not exist.

28
00:01:12,980 --> 00:01:13,700
Speaker 1: It's not a thing.

29
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:13,860
Speaker 2: That's wild.

30
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:16,720
Speaker 2: And now everybody's talking about MCP.

31
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:18,120
Speaker 2: You talk to any big companies.

32
00:01:18,790 --> 00:01:22,620
Speaker 2: You talk to the banks, the healthcare, the gaming.

33
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:24,880
Speaker 2: Everybody cares about MCP.

34
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:25,260
Speaker 1: That's great.

35
00:01:25,899 --> 00:01:31,340
Speaker 1: It's very great. We're going to dive into it. Before we do, let's dive into you. Give us a

36
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:35,580
Speaker 1: quick background on yourself. Absolutely. So I am Dan Delamarski. I'm a principal product

37
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:42,080
Speaker 2: engineer at Microsoft. I work in the core AI division. So we're focusing on, as the name

38
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:49,060
Speaker 2: suggests, AI stuff, but applied to developers. So I'm very, very heavily in the developer ecosystem.

39
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:54,739
Speaker 2: And I'm one of the core maintainers of the Moto Connors Protocol. So I say one of because there's

40
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:58,760
Speaker 2: many of us it's not just me there's many wonderful talented people way smarter than me

41
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:06,880
Speaker 1: and uh yeah that's a short intro okay so when we talk about mcp you're one of the people

42
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:12,560
Speaker 2: helping build it that's incredible that that is that is correct yeah i i try to contribute as

43
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:18,180
Speaker 1: much as i can well you know before we move on just how do you how do you get into that position

44
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:23,620
Speaker 2: oh it all started with one of the things that was actually near and dear to my heart which is

45
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:29,200
Speaker 2: security and authorization. So when MCP first came out, it had a auth spec. So we see on the screen

46
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:34,820
Speaker 2: right now, Michael is showing the kind of the model context protocol specification page. But when MCP

47
00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:41,140
Speaker 2: first started, it had essentially a spec that outlines how to do authorization for MCP servers.

48
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:47,240
Speaker 2: And that spec was a good start, but it made a lot of assumptions about the infrastructure and the

49
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:53,540
Speaker 2: tooling and how developers build MCP servers that were, I want to say, a little flawed at scale. So

50
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:58,980
Speaker 2: my thought was like, oh, I'll just get some smart people with me and we'll help rewrite this. And we

51
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:05,120
Speaker 2: asked the MCP folks at Anthropic and they said yes. And so we did. And I basically like incorporated

52
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:10,020
Speaker 2: all the feedback and iterated on it. And then again, it's a massive community effort. We pushed

53
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:16,160
Speaker 2: it out and got it merged in the June version of the protocol. And then the folks at Anthropic just

54
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:21,420
Speaker 2: reached out and said, hey, do you want to help shape the protocol? And here I am helping shape

55
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:26,040
Speaker 1: You seem to know what you're talking about and you sure are participating a lot. Why don't you just hang around?

56
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:27,020
Speaker 1: Yeah, basically.

57
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:33,280
Speaker 1: Okay. That's great. And you work at Microsoft. What do you do there?

58
00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:43,160
Speaker 2: That's correct. At Microsoft, I work on developer tools. So think like if you ever use Copilot, if you ever use any, oh, by the way, GitHub spec kit for folks that have not heard about it.

59
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:47,940
Speaker 2: We released it like last month, but that's something that I helped drive and help maintain.

60
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:53,960
Speaker 2: It's how do you do spec-driven development with agentic tools, agentic coding tools.

61
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:55,620
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's what I do.

62
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:57,200
Speaker 1: Okay, cool.

63
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:04,900
Speaker 1: So something that I've started to do a lot when I'm involving AI, I go in like spurts.

64
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,980
Speaker 1: I'll work for a long time, just sort of writing regular.

65
00:04:07,070 --> 00:04:12,240
Speaker 1: And then I'm like, ah, this is really a lot of drudgery, not critical or central to what I'm doing.

66
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:16,120
Speaker 1: and let me just uncork some agentic AI on it and let it go.

67
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:18,579
Speaker 1: But one of the things I've started doing a lot,

68
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:22,040
Speaker 1: and it has to do with the spec thing that you've touched on here,

69
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:27,120
Speaker 1: is I will force, I'll pick a really high-level model,

70
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:31,380
Speaker 1: like a complex smart model, and I'll say, I want to plan this out.

71
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:32,740
Speaker 1: I've given you some ideas.

72
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:35,700
Speaker 1: I want you to look at the code, and let's create a detailed plan

73
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:38,020
Speaker 1: of what you're going to do, and I'll have it write a markdown file.

74
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:40,720
Speaker 1: And even a lot of my projects, I have just a plans folder,

75
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:42,860
Speaker 1: and it's just full of all these different projects.

76
00:04:43,010 --> 00:04:45,780
Speaker 1: You know, maybe they're sort of equivalent to a PR in the end.

77
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:46,120
Speaker 2: Yeah.

78
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:48,400
Speaker 1: And I'll plan that out really well.

79
00:04:48,410 --> 00:04:51,620
Speaker 1: Then I'll switch it down to a lower model, to a new context,

80
00:04:51,650 --> 00:04:52,900
Speaker 1: and say, let's just do phase one.

81
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:54,640
Speaker 1: Let's do phase two and knock it out.

82
00:04:55,500 --> 00:05:00,780
Speaker 1: That sounds like a Michael just made up some stuff equivalent of the spec-based programming.

83
00:05:00,990 --> 00:05:01,460
Speaker 1: Is that right?

84
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:04,440
Speaker 1: Like, how does that compare to what you're talking about here?

85
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:05,060
Speaker 2: It's close.

86
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:05,860
Speaker 2: It's very close.

87
00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:08,800
Speaker 2: And this is where when people talk about spec-driven development,

88
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:12,300
Speaker 2: I want to emphasize the fact that there's no one correct approach.

89
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:17,180
Speaker 2: People think that it's like, oh, I'm just going to wait for whatever company is going to come out and come up with the right thing.

90
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,500
Speaker 2: It all depends on your experience.

91
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:19,800
Speaker 2: It depends on your models.

92
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:25,940
Speaker 2: The SpecKit project that we launched is our hypothesis, our experiment on how we believe it works.

93
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,940
Speaker 2: And what it does is basically what you described.

94
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:30,060
Speaker 2: You start with a spec.

95
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:33,180
Speaker 2: You start outlining what and why I am building.

96
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:39,240
Speaker 2: Then you focus on the technical implementation plan, which is like, okay, now what technology stack I'm using here.

97
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:51,020
Speaker 2: And then you break that down into tasks, which are basically just consumable chunks that the AI can go and either iteratively or in parallel, execute and build the stuff that you want to build.

98
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:53,180
Speaker 2: So all of it, again, is still an experiment.

99
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:59,400
Speaker 2: So I'm not by any stretch claiming that what we have is the end of it all or the right way to do this.

100
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:00,840
Speaker 2: There's many, many ways to do this.

101
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:09,040
Speaker 1: Okay. And you even over on dev blogs wrote, diving into spec driven development with GitHub

102
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:13,740
Speaker 2: spec kit. That is correct. There's also a GitHub blog that I highly recommend folks check out.

103
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:18,480
Speaker 2: It's actually on the, on the GitHub blog. So you can go there and look for, there you go. Uh,

104
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:22,120
Speaker 2: it's called spectrum development with AI gets started with a new open source toolkit.

105
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:27,300
Speaker 2: And we do have an open source toolkit. All right. So how is this different than just what I've done?

106
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:29,140
Speaker 1: I know I've seen this before.

107
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:29,740
Speaker 1: Yeah.

108
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:30,020
Speaker 1: Okay.

109
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:30,680
Speaker 2: Yeah.

110
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:34,720
Speaker 2: It just, all it does is think of it as this is the recipe book, right?

111
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:40,380
Speaker 2: Like if you decided to like, oh, I want to cook up a new application and you're like,

112
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:41,200
Speaker 2: well, what's the recipe?

113
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:43,060
Speaker 2: Like this bundles the recipe for it.

114
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:47,260
Speaker 2: And by the way, here's the box set of ingredients that you can just use to build this.

115
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:48,740
Speaker 2: That's what this is.

116
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:49,980
Speaker 2: That's Specget.

117
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:51,340
Speaker 1: Okay.

118
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:52,420
Speaker 1: Well, very exciting.

119
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:58,820
Speaker 1: Let's maybe start to get into the main topic, though,

120
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:00,200
Speaker 1: MCP servers.

121
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:06,240
Speaker 1: I've heard this put out as sort of an analogy to the LSP,

122
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:10,140
Speaker 1: which I know is--

123
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:12,020
Speaker 1: I first heard of it in VS Code.

124
00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:13,900
Speaker 1: I don't know if it came from VS Code.

125
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:14,400
Speaker 1: Maybe it did.

126
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:18,479
Speaker 1: But it's the thing that allows so many different editors

127
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:24,920
Speaker 1: to plug into tooling, like PyLance, or Pyrefly, or ty,

128
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:27,740
Speaker 1: or a bunch of cool things are coming out around here,

129
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:30,380
Speaker 1: different implementations of LSPs.

130
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:35,160
Speaker 1: And I've heard that MCPs are kind of like that for AI.

131
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:38,940
Speaker 1: Maybe contrast those a bit for people.

132
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:39,540
Speaker 2: Yeah.

133
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:42,760
Speaker 2: I mean, if you look at the MCP specification,

134
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,940
Speaker 2: if you look through the website and just peruse

135
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:47,199
Speaker 2: through the documentation, you might

136
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:52,140
Speaker 2: have like faint echoes of LSP design decisions, faint echoes of kind of the LSP architecture.

137
00:07:52,510 --> 00:07:56,900
Speaker 2: But yes, basically think of it this way. The way the folks at Anthropic have been describing it,

138
00:07:56,970 --> 00:08:06,240
Speaker 2: it is USB-C for AI. And when I say that is the problem with a lot of the LLMs, a lot of the

139
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:13,600
Speaker 2: modern models is the fact that it takes some amount of time to train them, which means that

140
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:20,460
Speaker 2: inherently they get locked into a specific training date, if you will. So the corpus of knowledge that

141
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:25,000
Speaker 2: gets embedded in them gets locked at a certain date. And when you talk to a lot of enterprise

142
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:28,980
Speaker 2: customers, you talk to a lot of customers in the wild, it doesn't need to be enterprise, by the way,

143
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:35,099
Speaker 2: it could be startups, could be hobbies, developers like, well, I want to use AI with this fresh data

144
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:40,820
Speaker 2: that I have. Maybe I have, I don't know, a Dropbox account, and I want to use AI to sort my files,

145
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:50,040
Speaker 2: Or maybe I want to use some data inside Salesforce to go and help me analyze my sales and find out outliers and maybe customers I want to focus on.

146
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:54,900
Speaker 1: I just interviewed the people from Nice Guy, Nice GUI.

147
00:08:55,500 --> 00:09:00,120
Speaker 1: And they build robots that cruise around in architectural areas.

148
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:10,420
Speaker 1: I want some way to ask AI, hey, look at how the robots are doing now.

149
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:18,080
Speaker 1: and then or see if they're busy find a free one right that might be a thing huh yeah yeah no for

150
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:24,380
Speaker 2: sure exactly it's like any kind of live data or managed data something that is more dynamic than

151
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:30,280
Speaker 2: the corpus of knowledge that is embedded in these models by default and for those if i would ask you

152
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:36,899
Speaker 2: like okay well let's imagine a world where mcp does not exist how would you go about plugging

153
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:43,960
Speaker 2: this data in, like into your LLM, right? And like, there's different ways to do this. Like people

154
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:50,960
Speaker 2: have done like the rags, people have done, you know, dump like CSV files and then be like,

155
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:56,480
Speaker 2: oh, analyze the CSV file and all these like hacky solutions. But it feels like it's not universal.

156
00:09:56,700 --> 00:10:01,680
Speaker 2: It doesn't really work for all cases. And something that you've done in one LLM doesn't work in

157
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:06,140
Speaker 2: another. And now you're locked into this environment. So it becomes very hard to manage.

158
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:08,980
Speaker 2: So MCP is essentially the answer to that.

159
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:14,520
Speaker 2: MCP says, look, we don't care what data you're connecting to, what applications, what actions.

160
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:29,080
Speaker 2: We provide you a universal interface by which every single LLM, every single client that understands MCP can invoke those primitives, get the data and embed the data in the context that you're operating in.

161
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:30,840
Speaker 2: And that's another important thing.

162
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,860
Speaker 2: People think of MCP as the data connector.

163
00:10:33,710 --> 00:10:34,920
Speaker 2: But it's not only a data connector.

164
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:37,060
Speaker 2: I want to call it like a primitive connector

165
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:40,140
Speaker 2: because you can use MCP with a lot of wonderful things

166
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:41,920
Speaker 2: that folks have probably seen already.

167
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:44,960
Speaker 2: Like my favorite example here is Blender MCP.

168
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:45,900
Speaker 2: Like for folks that don't know,

169
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:47,640
Speaker 1: Blender is a 3D modeling tool.

170
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:49,180
Speaker 2: And there's an MCP server

171
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:50,960
Speaker 2: by which you can actually guide an LLM saying,

172
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:54,140
Speaker 2: like, I am building this like medieval scene

173
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:56,000
Speaker 2: with a dragon and the lighting.

174
00:10:56,380 --> 00:10:59,340
Speaker 2: And it goes and it just, it builds it for you, right?

175
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:00,360
Speaker 2: Through this MCP.

176
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:03,860
Speaker 2: And MCP is the connective layer between Blender,

177
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,740
Speaker 2: which has its own native API.

178
00:11:06,370 --> 00:11:07,660
Speaker 2: And then there's the MCP server

179
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:10,440
Speaker 2: that the LM knows how to talk to, right?

180
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:11,840
Speaker 2: Because the LM wouldn't know how to like,

181
00:11:11,890 --> 00:11:12,960
Speaker 2: okay, how do you talk to Blender?

182
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:15,340
Speaker 2: How do you go and set up the plugin

183
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:17,160
Speaker 2: and whatever the web sockets,

184
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:18,140
Speaker 2: whatever they might be using, right?

185
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,240
Speaker 2: Like it's super complex.

186
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:20,320
Speaker 2: So it needs expertise,

187
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:21,780
Speaker 2: but an MCP server is essentially saying,

188
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,800
Speaker 2: I have these set of primitives

189
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:25,320
Speaker 2: that the LM can invoke at any time,

190
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:28,340
Speaker 2: like create polygon or create scene

191
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:29,260
Speaker 2: or create sphere.

192
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:31,280
Speaker 2: And then based on that information,

193
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:32,220
Speaker 2: go and iterate on it.

194
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,100
Speaker 1: So MCP is that adapter.

195
00:11:34,530 --> 00:11:34,660
Speaker 1: Yeah.

196
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:35,600
Speaker 1: I see.

197
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:39,880
Speaker 1: So the LLM or agentic AI or whatever that you're working with,

198
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:42,200
Speaker 1: it says, all right, I'm going to talk to Blender.

199
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:46,740
Speaker 1: Blender says I have these core ideas, these core building blocks.

200
00:11:46,830 --> 00:11:52,260
Speaker 1: It sort of turns it more into Lego instead of just I'm going to have a saw

201
00:11:52,270 --> 00:11:53,260
Speaker 1: or whatever I can cut.

202
00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:53,760
Speaker 1: Exactly.

203
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:54,200
Speaker 1: Okay.

204
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:55,000
Speaker 1: I have spheres.

205
00:11:55,230 --> 00:11:56,960
Speaker 1: I have cylinders.

206
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:58,380
Speaker 1: I have squares.

207
00:11:58,770 --> 00:11:59,520
Speaker 1: I have shading.

208
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:00,400
Speaker 1: Yeah.

209
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:01,680
Speaker 1: They've asked me to do this.

210
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:04,360
Speaker 1: what can I build composing that sort of?

211
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:05,560
Speaker 1: Exactly. Precisely.

212
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:08,280
Speaker 2: Right. So you're operating on a set of primitives, right?

213
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:10,340
Speaker 2: And this is where you don't even need to expose

214
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:12,900
Speaker 2: the entirety of the surface of Blender APIs.

215
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:14,680
Speaker 2: You can just say like, oh, I want to have like,

216
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:17,580
Speaker 2: there's the 10 primitives that I think are the most valuable.

217
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:18,580
Speaker 2: I'm going to go ahead and use those.

218
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:20,820
Speaker 2: And out of those, you compose things.

219
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:23,180
Speaker 1: And maybe there's an advantage to that too, right?

220
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:26,620
Speaker 1: Maybe like, I want to use Blender to create 2D scenes.

221
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:30,499
Speaker 1: So I'm only going to expose stuff or rotations

222
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:33,340
Speaker 1: or whatever that preserve some sort of 2D view of the thing.

223
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:36,100
Speaker 1: Like we're doing CAD where it's top down from the side.

224
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:37,460
Speaker 1: Like those are the ways you're going to look at it.

225
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:38,700
Speaker 1: You can't arbitrarily rotate it.

226
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:39,240
Speaker 2: Yeah.

227
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:41,760
Speaker 2: So essentially like the MCP servers in this case

228
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,600
Speaker 2: act as a universal translation layer

229
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:46,400
Speaker 2: between whatever's downstream of the MCP server,

230
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:50,340
Speaker 2: which can be an application, an API, a database, like anything.

231
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:53,040
Speaker 2: And the client, which knows like,

232
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:55,340
Speaker 2: I know how to talk to MCP and nothing else.

233
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:56,520
Speaker 2: I have no idea what's behind.

234
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:58,640
Speaker 2: I don't know what the REST API you have,

235
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,740
Speaker 2: What's the authentication authorization logic?

236
00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:02,560
Speaker 2: Just give an MCP server.

237
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:03,760
Speaker 1: - Okay.

238
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:06,300
Speaker 1: It sounds a little bit like an API.

239
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:08,040
Speaker 1: And by API, I mean,

240
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:09,080
Speaker 1: - Yes.

241
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:11,840
Speaker 1: - The most general sense of the word, not,

242
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:15,960
Speaker 1: oh, it's a REST API and it makes sure it uses the verbs

243
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:16,320
Speaker 1: this way.

244
00:13:16,510 --> 00:13:19,040
Speaker 1: I mean, like anything that you could sort of call

245
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:21,620
Speaker 1: and either get data or cause an action

246
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:24,020
Speaker 1: that could be a REST API, but it could just be,

247
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:28,660
Speaker 1: a West level API or something like that.

248
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:29,980
Speaker 2: Yeah, totally.

249
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:34,440
Speaker 2: I mean, all it is just a connective layer.

250
00:13:35,030 --> 00:13:35,420
Speaker 2: So, yeah.

251
00:13:35,950 --> 00:13:39,580
Speaker 2: And people often ask, well, couldn't you do this with REST APIs?

252
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:42,760
Speaker 2: Couldn't you do this with GraphQL APIs instead?

253
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:44,440
Speaker 2: Because it's been invented.

254
00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:45,580
Speaker 2: Why are we creating new things?

255
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:51,200
Speaker 2: But the thing about this is, even if you look in the world of REST APIs,

256
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:52,040
Speaker 2: think about it.

257
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:55,120
Speaker 2: The last time you worked with a REST API from some vendor

258
00:13:55,270 --> 00:13:56,820
Speaker 2: and then switched another REST API from someone,

259
00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:00,340
Speaker 2: How much of that knowledge was like one-to-one reused?

260
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,280
Speaker 2: Or the infrastructure that you built?

261
00:14:02,350 --> 00:14:03,320
Speaker 2: Or authentication logic?

262
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:07,760
Speaker 2: You have these 17 different dances by which you get the token, right?

263
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:12,360
Speaker 2: And MCP essentially is the opinionated version of saying,

264
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:14,940
Speaker 2: no, this is how you do auth.

265
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:18,480
Speaker 2: This is how you do message passing between entities.

266
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:20,620
Speaker 2: This is how you expose primitives.

267
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:23,280
Speaker 2: It's a highly opinionated stack.

268
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:40,080
Speaker 1: Yeah, and so then once implemented, we call them the hosts, like VS Code or PyCharm or Cursor or whatever, Claude Code, it knows, all right, here's how I inspect the capabilities of this thing.

269
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:45,000
Speaker 1: Here's how I stream back the responses if it's going to take it 10 minutes to do what I asked it.

270
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:49,660
Speaker 1: This is how you do it with streaming HTTP APIs and so on.

271
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:50,980
Speaker 2: Precisely, right?

272
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:54,400
Speaker 2: Because you only need to then implement once.

273
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:57,940
Speaker 2: And especially if you use one of the existing MCP SDKs

274
00:14:58,020 --> 00:14:59,240
Speaker 2: that we're going to be talking down the line,

275
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:01,740
Speaker 2: that's the core value prop.

276
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:03,820
Speaker 2: It's like you do it once and it just works.

277
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:04,940
Speaker 2: You don't need to worry about like,

278
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:07,920
Speaker 2: oh, but this other MCP server decided to implement their auth

279
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:09,140
Speaker 2: in a completely different way.

280
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:10,000
Speaker 2: What do I do now?

281
00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:11,180
Speaker 1: Yeah.

282
00:15:14,759 --> 00:15:17,260
Speaker 1: Now, if I want to build one of these things,

283
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:22,820
Speaker 1: Does it have to be implemented in an LLM?

284
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:34,300
Speaker 1: Or can I build just a traditional FastAPI API that ultimately does queries against a database with no prompt?

285
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:35,420
Speaker 2: Yeah.

286
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:44,600
Speaker 2: No, I mean, like, MCP servers themselves are just essentially entities that are capable of exchanging JSON RPC messages.

287
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:49,920
Speaker 2: Like you can write a client that is completely detached from an LLM and just invokes tools.

288
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:50,820
Speaker 2: Right.

289
00:15:51,170 --> 00:15:51,260
Speaker 1: Okay.

290
00:15:51,690 --> 00:15:51,780
Speaker 1: Awesome.

291
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:53,600
Speaker 2: You can if you want to.

292
00:15:53,670 --> 00:15:56,240
Speaker 2: I don't know why you would do that, but you absolutely can.

293
00:15:57,940 --> 00:15:59,060
Speaker 1: I'm sure people have a reason.

294
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:03,320
Speaker 1: So I see a comment out in the audience from Frankie about RAG.

295
00:16:03,370 --> 00:16:08,740
Speaker 1: And also, you mentioned RAG at the beginning and say, well, maybe RAG is not working for you.

296
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:12,540
Speaker 1: Let's just sort of contrast that a bit, right?

297
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:14,920
Speaker 1: Like maybe not everyone knows what RAG is.

298
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:21,760
Speaker 2: retrieval augmented generation what is this yeah essentially if you have a way for you to um

299
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:28,780
Speaker 2: optimize basically the context for the llm i'll put i'll put it this way like in very layman terms

300
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:36,360
Speaker 2: it's like i have a code base i have a code base that has a number of entities like classes and

301
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:42,819
Speaker 2: you know functions and everything and in a rag you're essentially building a a vector database

302
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:46,360
Speaker 2: that says like, okay, here's the list of things that exist.

303
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:49,740
Speaker 2: And then the LLM, you can go and query this thing

304
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:51,800
Speaker 2: and find out what exists in this code base.

305
00:16:52,060 --> 00:16:53,160
Speaker 2: So if you make decisions about like,

306
00:16:53,260 --> 00:16:55,760
Speaker 2: I want to build a authorization component,

307
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:56,500
Speaker 2: how do I do this?

308
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:57,120
Speaker 2: It's like, okay, well,

309
00:16:57,860 --> 00:16:59,980
Speaker 2: it can build out that context for itself.

310
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:03,380
Speaker 2: This is kind of the very basic idea behind the rag.

311
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:04,640
Speaker 1: Got it.

312
00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:07,420
Speaker 1: So instead of trying to put all the information

313
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:08,480
Speaker 1: just into a prompt,

314
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:10,480
Speaker 1: it has to read every time you can kind of

315
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:12,560
Speaker 1: additionally train it on these things.

316
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:15,520
Speaker 1: and then keep the question shorter

317
00:17:15,579 --> 00:17:16,780
Speaker 1: because it knows the details.

318
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:17,680
Speaker 2: Right.

319
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:19,180
Speaker 2: You essentially have a knowledge base

320
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:21,900
Speaker 2: that's outside of the primary training set.

321
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:24,880
Speaker 2: Like that's the core value prop of this

322
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:27,860
Speaker 2: is you're augmenting the LLM

323
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:28,940
Speaker 2: with additional knowledge

324
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:30,940
Speaker 2: that you have in the context

325
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:31,740
Speaker 2: that you're operating in.

326
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:33,240
Speaker 1: Okay.

327
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:37,100
Speaker 1: So something I've wanted to build for a while

328
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:39,380
Speaker 1: and I do intend to,

329
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:40,819
Speaker 1: but we'll see if I ever get there

330
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:47,360
Speaker 1: is something where people could go and have like an AI conversation with this episode, for example,

331
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:52,980
Speaker 1: right? With something on the podcast, I've got 10 years of transcripts. Yeah. You know,

332
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:59,620
Speaker 1: like over a million words, I'm pretty sure that doesn't fit in most contexts. And even if it does,

333
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:10,800
Speaker 1: it's problematic. Yeah. So it'd be great to do some sort of rag thing for Talk Python. Maybe

334
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:11,140
Speaker 1: Yeah.

335
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:13,760
Speaker 1: What could I do with MCPs in the podcast, do you think?

336
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:15,660
Speaker 1: MCPs in a podcast.

337
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:19,360
Speaker 2: So one of them, of course, is like querying the data,

338
00:18:20,010 --> 00:18:23,300
Speaker 2: which is I want to make sure that, you know,

339
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:27,740
Speaker 2: find me all the episodes where I ever talked with Michael about AI.

340
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:28,620
Speaker 2: Right.

341
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:28,920
Speaker 2: Sure.

342
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:29,560
Speaker 2: Could be one thing.

343
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:35,980
Speaker 2: I actually think that because of the richness of the MCP capabilities,

344
00:18:36,090 --> 00:18:37,460
Speaker 2: to me, when it comes to like podcasts,

345
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:41,040
Speaker 2: I envision a world where I can use MCPs to edit podcasts.

346
00:18:42,019 --> 00:18:43,600
Speaker 2: That's my dream of this.

347
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,860
Speaker 2: And actually, this is something that I've been experimenting with

348
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:50,040
Speaker 2: because I haven't fully wrapped around

349
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:52,540
Speaker 2: how exactly that would look like.

350
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:54,000
Speaker 2: But one of the things that I do,

351
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:55,640
Speaker 2: as I'm sure you do when you edit the podcast,

352
00:18:55,780 --> 00:18:58,780
Speaker 2: you have to go through it, generate the transcript,

353
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:03,200
Speaker 2: clean up things, then make sure that you add timestamps,

354
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:05,300
Speaker 2: select the most interesting parts about the podcast.

355
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:12,320
Speaker 2: So can I potentially go to an alarm and say, okay, here's where my MP3 file is.

356
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:19,980
Speaker 2: Can you go and generate transcript, clean it up, and then find me the most interesting parts about this,

357
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:26,620
Speaker 2: and then produce me a report that I can then use to maybe like a HTML-based web app,

358
00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:29,460
Speaker 2: and I can just like a one-click save, like publish, right?

359
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:35,400
Speaker 2: And to me, like the value of maybe the MCP connector here is that maybe I can plug it in behind the scenes

360
00:19:35,420 --> 00:19:37,500
Speaker 2: with like FFmpeg to go and convert

361
00:19:37,530 --> 00:19:39,360
Speaker 2: the MP3 into a WAV file

362
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:41,360
Speaker 2: and then use Whisper to go and generate

363
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:43,120
Speaker 2: the transcript and then go and

364
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:45,340
Speaker 2: extract things for it, right? And for a lot of

365
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:47,240
Speaker 2: these pieces of the tasks

366
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:49,280
Speaker 2: that you do, you would imagine that you would have a different

367
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:51,140
Speaker 2: tool inside my MC server, which

368
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:52,680
Speaker 2: tool is one of the primitives that basically

369
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:54,980
Speaker 2: LLM invokes. And it says, oh,

370
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:57,360
Speaker 2: let me generate the transcript. And there's a tool

371
00:19:57,460 --> 00:19:58,900
Speaker 2: that's called generate transcript and it's going to

372
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:01,180
Speaker 2: use that to produce a transcript. And it's like,

373
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:02,560
Speaker 1: okay, there's another tool that says

374
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:04,040
Speaker 1: find interesting parts.

375
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:09,480
Speaker 1: Yes, you could give, just give the LLM an episode number, 200 or something.

376
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:10,000
Speaker 1: Yeah.

377
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:16,300
Speaker 1: And it could go to your podcast MCP server and say, transcript for 200, even if it doesn't

378
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:19,600
Speaker 1: exist, it'll figure it out and generate it, that kind of stuff.

379
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:20,100
Speaker 2: Yes.

380
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:25,700
Speaker 2: And also the wonderful thing about LLMs and MCP servers is that you're not actually using

381
00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:27,100
Speaker 2: just one MCP server, right?

382
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:31,640
Speaker 2: So I might have an MCP server for myself that is basically, like I said, the one that generates

383
00:20:31,660 --> 00:20:38,440
Speaker 2: transcripts, you know, creates a landing page in my podcast website. And then based on that content,

384
00:20:39,260 --> 00:20:44,340
Speaker 2: there's also next steps. Now I have an MP3, I want to upload that MP3 to Cloudflare, where I host my

385
00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:48,960
Speaker 2: podcast. So there may be a Cloudflare MCP server that the LM is going to invoke and say, I need to

386
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:52,640
Speaker 2: now upload this. And then it's going to invoke the other MCP server, right? So you have this

387
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:58,380
Speaker 2: basically stack of MCP servers that you can start using one with another. And that's where the

388
00:20:58,220 --> 00:21:01,820
Speaker 2: superpower comes from like you're not just using one application and saying like okay hold on let

389
00:21:01,820 --> 00:21:05,900
Speaker 2: me let me finish a task for podcast production then i'll do other things like it can chain things

390
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:09,860
Speaker 2: together and then say oh and by the way there's an mcp server maybe for audio conversion that

391
00:21:09,980 --> 00:21:14,900
Speaker 2: produces like 10 variations of the format let me invoke that and then you're going through this

392
00:21:15,130 --> 00:21:20,840
Speaker 1: process yeah i think that's one of the really big you know hints at one of the really big differences

393
00:21:20,860 --> 00:21:23,860
Speaker 1: between just using a chat LLM

394
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:28,320
Speaker 1: versus some of the agent tool using types of things, right?

395
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:32,340
Speaker 1: The ability to say, now I have to accomplish this task,

396
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:34,480
Speaker 1: and I know I figured out there is some way

397
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:36,460
Speaker 1: I'm capable of accomplishing that, right?

398
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:39,040
Speaker 1: Either that's to list a directory, to look for a file,

399
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:42,160
Speaker 1: or to communicate with the Cloudflare MCP

400
00:21:42,420 --> 00:21:45,060
Speaker 1: that we talked about, and so on.

401
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:48,560
Speaker 1: Yeah, our is composability.

402
00:21:48,620 --> 00:21:49,200
Speaker 2: I'll put it this way.

403
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:55,900
Speaker 2: It's the fact that you can compose things together and have them work together based on the prompts that you have and scenarios that you have.

404
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:57,040
Speaker 1: Okay, cool.

405
00:21:57,150 --> 00:22:04,460
Speaker 1: So imagining the Cloudflare MCP thing exists, your podcast preparation MCP thing exists.

406
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:07,020
Speaker 1: How does my AI know?

407
00:22:07,340 --> 00:22:09,340
Speaker 1: Let's keep it real basic.

408
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:12,740
Speaker 1: Let's say I'm using Claude Code, but we could plug this into others.

409
00:22:13,250 --> 00:22:16,600
Speaker 1: But just even something just terminal-based, no UI or whatever.

410
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:17,980
Speaker 1: Yeah.

411
00:22:18,740 --> 00:22:21,120
Speaker 1: Is it going to discover them just out of the blue?

412
00:22:21,470 --> 00:22:22,480
Speaker 1: Probably not all of them.

413
00:22:22,510 --> 00:22:24,080
Speaker 1: You got to point it at them.

414
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:27,380
Speaker 1: And how does it know which ones it's allowed to use in this context?

415
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:29,820
Speaker 1: How do I get it so I can actually use one of these?

416
00:22:29,870 --> 00:22:31,100
Speaker 1: And we'll talk about maybe building them.

417
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:31,680
Speaker 2: Yeah.

418
00:22:31,830 --> 00:22:38,340
Speaker 2: So for MCP servers themselves, you add them explicitly to your host or your client,

419
00:22:38,660 --> 00:22:39,080
Speaker 2: whatever that might be.

420
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:41,320
Speaker 2: VS Code, Claude Code, Cloud Desktop, doesn't matter.

421
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:46,820
Speaker 2: So you explicitly say, I want to use my podcast MCP.

422
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:49,100
Speaker 2: I want to be using my Cloudflare MCP server.

423
00:22:49,110 --> 00:22:50,800
Speaker 2: I want to use my, I don't know,

424
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:53,520
Speaker 2: Descript MCP servers to remove the ums and uhs

425
00:22:53,660 --> 00:22:54,540
Speaker 2: from the podcast, right?

426
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:57,720
Speaker 2: So you would essentially go through some means

427
00:22:57,960 --> 00:22:59,660
Speaker 2: in that client, on your client of choice,

428
00:22:59,730 --> 00:23:01,000
Speaker 2: to go and add those MCP servers.

429
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:03,840
Speaker 2: Now, the question is, how do you discover those MCP servers?

430
00:23:04,060 --> 00:23:06,820
Speaker 2: So there's various places where you can go to.

431
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:09,240
Speaker 2: We just launched the MCP registry

432
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:12,360
Speaker 2: that is nothing short other than an API

433
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:15,800
Speaker 2: that indexes all of the available MCP servers

434
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:16,680
Speaker 2: that are out there.

435
00:23:17,180 --> 00:23:21,720
Speaker 2: right so uh we're looking right now at a blog post on the mcp blog it's called introducing the mcp

436
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:26,140
Speaker 2: registry that got published september 8th of this year so not not that long ago but but basically

437
00:23:26,660 --> 00:23:31,060
Speaker 1: 22 days or something like that and when you say we you're talking the official model context

438
00:23:31,430 --> 00:23:36,800
Speaker 1: protocol.io working yes yes the model context protocol folks uh and there's a bunch of them that

439
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:41,780
Speaker 2: were specifically focused on the registry right and you see them in the authors like david sariapara

440
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:44,820
Speaker 2: Adam Jones, Tadas, Toby, and Theo.

441
00:23:45,630 --> 00:23:46,860
Speaker 2: But they essentially were in charge

442
00:23:46,910 --> 00:23:47,820
Speaker 2: of kind of building this out.

443
00:23:47,930 --> 00:23:51,160
Speaker 2: And the registry is a centralized API,

444
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:54,420
Speaker 2: essentially, that aggregates an index

445
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:56,000
Speaker 2: of MCP servers that are out there.

446
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:58,640
Speaker 2: So you can use the registry inside your client,

447
00:23:58,920 --> 00:23:59,880
Speaker 2: whatever client you might be using,

448
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:02,780
Speaker 2: to find MCP servers for what you want.

449
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:04,660
Speaker 2: Maybe there is a Playwright MCP server.

450
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:06,800
Speaker 2: Maybe there is a Perflexity MCP server.

451
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:08,920
Speaker 2: So it's all coming from the registry.

452
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:12,220
Speaker 2: Okay. Sounds a little bit like Docker Hub.

453
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:25,660
Speaker 2: Kind of. Yes. And just like Docker Hub, you actually don't need Docker Hub to install an MCP server or in this case, like a Docker container, right? Like you can just go to random GitHub repos and find somebody built an MCP server for what you're trying to do. And you can just plug it in.

454
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:32,960
Speaker 1: Yeah, interesting. Yeah, that's how I use Docker Hub by not using Docker Hub for all the stuff I build. But you know, I get the foundations.

455
00:24:34,620 --> 00:24:36,360
Speaker 1: He's like, I'm like, ah, but I'm going to build it here.

456
00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:40,780
Speaker 1: It also has the concept of public and private registries.

457
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:41,440
Speaker 2: Yes.

458
00:24:42,260 --> 00:24:42,340
Speaker 2: Yeah.

459
00:24:42,580 --> 00:24:47,660
Speaker 2: So public registry is essentially something that, like GitHub, by the way, maintains their own registry.

460
00:24:48,060 --> 00:24:48,780
Speaker 2: So it's public.

461
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:54,660
Speaker 2: And you can just go and discover MCP servers through the GitHub registry or the public registry.

462
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:58,320
Speaker 2: Also, we know that MCP servers are used within different companies.

463
00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:06,420
Speaker 2: You might have, let's say, some data that you're locking in behind seven gates that only certain people can access.

464
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:08,720
Speaker 2: You can build internal MCP servers.

465
00:25:08,790 --> 00:25:13,700
Speaker 2: And for those things, you ship internal private registries where you can say, no, no, no.

466
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:18,940
Speaker 2: I want my folks in my company to only access these servers and nothing else.

467
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:20,200
Speaker 2: Right.

468
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:21,060
Speaker 1: Sure.

469
00:25:22,780 --> 00:25:23,300
Speaker 1: Yeah, that makes sense.

470
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:28,180
Speaker 1: Is there a place that I can go to the model context protocol registry,

471
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:32,420
Speaker 1: the MCP registry, and browse it like you can, Docker?

472
00:25:32,580 --> 00:25:32,720
Speaker 1: Yeah.

473
00:25:33,170 --> 00:25:33,320
Speaker 2: Yeah.

474
00:25:33,390 --> 00:25:36,280
Speaker 2: So right now, you can't browse it through a UI,

475
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:40,860
Speaker 2: but you can look at other registries that can consume some of the content from here.

476
00:25:40,930 --> 00:25:43,960
Speaker 2: So I believe GitHub registry is one of the consumers.

477
00:25:44,070 --> 00:25:47,860
Speaker 2: You can look at, I think it's gethub.com slash MCP.

478
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:50,840
Speaker 2: There we go.

479
00:25:51,180 --> 00:25:51,320
Speaker 2: Yeah.

480
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:52,620
Speaker 2: Okay.

481
00:25:53,020 --> 00:25:54,040
Speaker 2: And you can see some of the registries.

482
00:25:54,090 --> 00:25:56,020
Speaker 2: And you can see, like, if you click on one of the install buttons,

483
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:59,420
Speaker 2: it's going to, like, allow you to take it directly into, like, VS Code

484
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:02,980
Speaker 2: and then just bring it in and install it in the context of your editor.

485
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:04,320
Speaker 1: Okay.

486
00:26:04,810 --> 00:26:04,900
Speaker 1: Yeah.

487
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:05,500
Speaker 2: Very nice.

488
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:12,800
Speaker 1: So some of these are, like, web crawling, Notion.

489
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:13,340
Speaker 1: Okay.

490
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,720
Speaker 1: I know Notion just added a big agentic AI thing,

491
00:26:17,380 --> 00:26:19,120
Speaker 1: and I've seen a lot of pushback.

492
00:26:19,660 --> 00:26:22,360
Speaker 1: There's probably a lot of happy users who just use it, but...

493
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:23,000
Speaker 1: Yeah.

494
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:24,800
Speaker 1: People are like, why is this in my way?

495
00:26:24,820 --> 00:26:25,660
Speaker 1: I just want to work with this.

496
00:26:26,180 --> 00:26:30,600
Speaker 1: But, you know, if you were, it'd be really cool to maybe plug that in instead of going,

497
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:35,680
Speaker 1: we're going to try to use the API to download this embedded database with the information.

498
00:26:36,060 --> 00:26:36,140
Speaker 1: Exactly.

499
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:37,740
Speaker 1: Like you just talk to it, right?

500
00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:38,540
Speaker 2: Exactly.

501
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:44,240
Speaker 2: That's, again, what I like about MCP is that if I want to connect to Notion to get my notebook

502
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:48,160
Speaker 2: and some notes from my stand-up meetings, I don't need to worry about how they structure

503
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:50,480
Speaker 2: their API and how to use auth or something.

504
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:52,520
Speaker 2: Just install the Notion MCP and then ask the alarm,

505
00:26:52,650 --> 00:26:54,620
Speaker 2: like pull the latest notes and summarize them for me.

506
00:26:55,190 --> 00:26:55,980
Speaker 2: And then it's going to know.

507
00:26:57,660 --> 00:26:58,440
Speaker 2: Is there a LinkedIn one?

508
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:00,120
Speaker 2: Their API is so bad.

509
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:03,680
Speaker 1: Oh, it makes me sad.

510
00:27:03,860 --> 00:27:05,640
Speaker 2: For any LinkedIn people watching this,

511
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:07,260
Speaker 2: we need to have a LinkedIn MCP server.

512
00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:08,460
Speaker 1: Yes, I think so.

513
00:27:08,830 --> 00:27:09,560
Speaker 1: It might save me.

514
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:10,920
Speaker 1: Okay.

515
00:27:11,980 --> 00:27:13,040
Speaker 1: Very interesting here.

516
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:18,100
Speaker 1: I think people should come here and just kind of poke around.

517
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:24,940
Speaker 1: You can see there's a lot of interesting things that I think might spark some ideas as you

518
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:27,280
Speaker 1: start to play with it, like Postman.

519
00:27:27,590 --> 00:27:30,440
Speaker 1: So I guess one of the problems, not one of the problems, one of the things you're going

520
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:37,820
Speaker 1: to want to deal with is a lot of these I see here, LaunchDarkly, Postman, Atlassian, Notion,

521
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:38,400
Speaker 1: and so on.

522
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:46,720
Speaker 1: You go to pass things like, I am this person, therefore I want to see my information, not

523
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:50,620
Speaker 1: other people's or only public i gotta see private info but mine

524
00:27:54,260 --> 00:27:57,560
Speaker 1: there's a whole security side and i think that's kind of how you got pulled into it right

525
00:27:57,920 --> 00:28:03,520
Speaker 2: yeah oh yeah yeah yeah so for for these things yeah we just put like an api key in github and

526
00:28:03,580 --> 00:28:08,380
Speaker 1: just check that in and just use that when you're trying to don't do that don't put api keys in

527
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:14,520
Speaker 2: github and check them in um what what can be done so starting with the latest spec of mcp that again

528
00:28:14,540 --> 00:28:21,700
Speaker 2: shipped in June, there is a formal way for services to do authorization. So it's based on OAuth, OAuth 2.1.

529
00:28:22,180 --> 00:28:27,220
Speaker 2: I know that there's people listening that's like, oh no, did you just say OAuth? I have to learn OAuth now?

530
00:28:27,390 --> 00:28:31,640
Speaker 2: You don't. Again, there's a lot of libraries that do this. If you're an MCP server developer,

531
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:35,420
Speaker 2: it's solved for you. If you're an MCP server consumer, you don't even need to think about it.

532
00:28:35,830 --> 00:28:41,900
Speaker 2: So when you connect an MCP server, as a consumer, you'll essentially have the ability to log in with

533
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:47,260
Speaker 2: your credentials. So if an MCP server, for example, for like we saw Chromo and we're like MongoDB,

534
00:28:47,820 --> 00:28:51,720
Speaker 2: that's on the screen here. If I use the MongoDB server and I want to connect to a database,

535
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:57,280
Speaker 2: usually they provide you a way to either one. You go into your MCP server config and you say,

536
00:28:57,420 --> 00:29:02,760
Speaker 2: I will give you an API key if your server is using an API key. Or if it's using OAuth,

537
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:09,260
Speaker 2: then you can just essentially snap to using OAuth the standard flow. Your client is going to

538
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:10,760
Speaker 2: bootstrap the authentication flow.

539
00:29:11,300 --> 00:29:13,840
Speaker 2: You're going to go to the box, enter your credentials, log in.

540
00:29:14,250 --> 00:29:18,120
Speaker 2: The client is going to store the tokens, and then you access the server with your credentials

541
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:21,120
Speaker 2: as you getting access to your data, not something else.

542
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:28,280
Speaker 1: One thing that looks really interesting, and there's an example of it right here with the

543
00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:28,560
Speaker 1: Nux.

544
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:33,060
Speaker 1: Never written a Nux app in my life, but here we have.

545
00:29:33,070 --> 00:29:38,160
Speaker 1: I have one that helps you understand your Vite Nux app.

546
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:44,720
Speaker 1: one of the things that I think could be really interesting and probably MCPs could play a really

547
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:52,560
Speaker 1: important role is we have these huge foundation models open AI and cloud opus and so on that are

548
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:58,840
Speaker 1: generally knowledgeable about the whole world and are big expensive to train but I can see a future

549
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:08,160
Speaker 1: where we get good enough to have a bunch of small models like this is the view.js model yeah you if

550
00:30:08,180 --> 00:30:12,500
Speaker 1: to know Vue.js. It's as good as anything, but it runs on your computer in a gig of RAM

551
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:19,920
Speaker 1: because it's just trained so specifically on Vue. And I feel like maybe you could MCP your way

552
00:30:20,140 --> 00:30:25,280
Speaker 1: together. Like, well, I'm using this tech stack, so we're going to click together a bunch of things

553
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:31,380
Speaker 1: that don't provide data, but provide information about what your architecture or something like

554
00:30:31,410 --> 00:30:34,960
Speaker 1: that. What do you think? Yeah. I mean, I think it can go both ways, right? Like there's a

555
00:30:34,940 --> 00:30:39,940
Speaker 2: specialized model and there's an argument for saying that the more general scenarios would

556
00:30:39,970 --> 00:30:43,460
Speaker 2: always work best like there's i think there's always two camps of those folks that i talked to

557
00:30:44,020 --> 00:30:49,400
Speaker 2: i personally think that i think for certain things there is a tremendous amount of value for hyper

558
00:30:50,279 --> 00:30:56,580
Speaker 2: centralized or hyper hyper local models i'll give an example right like i want to organize

559
00:30:57,510 --> 00:31:01,880
Speaker 2: the photos on my machine like maybe i have a lot of duplicates that you know because

560
00:31:02,540 --> 00:31:04,580
Speaker 2: when you take photos of your modern cell phones,

561
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:06,180
Speaker 2: just click, click, click, click, click, and then you have

562
00:31:06,530 --> 00:31:08,020
Speaker 2: 10 images of your dog. And you're like,

563
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:09,760
Speaker 2: they're kind of the same, but I want to pick the best one.

564
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:12,240
Speaker 2: From a privacy standpoint,

565
00:31:12,510 --> 00:31:14,300
Speaker 2: I don't want to send that off

566
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:16,300
Speaker 2: to some server remotely somewhere with my photos,

567
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:18,160
Speaker 2: which, you know, there's family

568
00:31:18,530 --> 00:31:19,540
Speaker 2: photos, there's all sorts of

569
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:22,100
Speaker 2: stuff that I do not want to send off to some remote

570
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:24,260
Speaker 2: server. For those things, I want to use a local

571
00:31:24,580 --> 00:31:26,180
Speaker 2: model, and maybe there's an MCP server that

572
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:28,200
Speaker 2: allows me to basically be like, oh, I

573
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:30,140
Speaker 2: can find the photos and then crop them

574
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:30,740
Speaker 2: and like,

575
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:35,820
Speaker 2: add some metadata or remove metadata or whatever I want to do. Right. So for those things, I

576
00:31:36,140 --> 00:31:39,980
Speaker 2: absolutely see the value in these like local models where I can just say, I want it to be

577
00:31:40,250 --> 00:31:45,040
Speaker 2: very good at this one specific task and that task only. And I will never use this photo model for

578
00:31:45,150 --> 00:31:49,980
Speaker 2: web app creation, but photos is going to be darn good. And I think there's a lot of value for that.

579
00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:53,560
Speaker 2: And if you augment it with MCP, I think it's superpowers right there.

580
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:59,980
Speaker 1: Yeah, it does seem like it could be. It could be this little step would benefit from a local

581
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,740
Speaker 1: model, but I don't want to constrain the entire problem solving to a local model.

582
00:32:04,420 --> 00:32:04,640
Speaker 1: Right.

583
00:32:04,660 --> 00:32:04,800
Speaker 1: Right.

584
00:32:04,820 --> 00:32:06,420
Speaker 1: I think that's kind of the problem.

585
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:12,460
Speaker 1: Like I use LM Studio a lot and I've got, for example, I have the OpenAI 20 billion parameter

586
00:32:13,180 --> 00:32:16,840
Speaker 1: open weights model that I actually program against and it does all sorts of cool stuff

587
00:32:17,020 --> 00:32:20,620
Speaker 1: for me, but I don't use it for my general work because it's either too slow because

588
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:26,220
Speaker 1: it's on my Mac mini or I just want something that is better, right?

589
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:26,880
Speaker 1: Yeah.

590
00:32:27,420 --> 00:32:35,640
Speaker 1: And so if you're going to just start a, like, I'm using this model to solve this problem, like, that might not be the final outcome where we end up, right?

591
00:32:36,180 --> 00:32:36,780
Speaker 2: Yeah, for sure.

592
00:32:37,220 --> 00:32:47,040
Speaker 2: And especially because for a lot of the generalized models, you're, like, no matter how you look at this, you're not going to have the computer resources anywhere near what, like, OpenA Anthropic has.

593
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:47,900
Speaker 2: Right.

594
00:32:48,170 --> 00:32:50,340
Speaker 2: So, like, in terms of speed and quality, what are you going to get?

595
00:32:50,420 --> 00:32:55,280
Speaker 2: You might get some, like, fine-tuned examples where some scenarios work very, very well.

596
00:32:55,600 --> 00:33:01,140
Speaker 2: But I think ultimately, if we look at the general use case, these generalizable models are going to be ahead.

597
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:03,840
Speaker 1: Yeah, I definitely agree as well.

598
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:15,780
Speaker 1: But I hadn't really considered how MCPs might allow you to use the really high-end models to compose specialized, not quite as generally smart, but specialized versions of different things.

599
00:33:16,210 --> 00:33:16,620
Speaker 1: It could be.

600
00:33:17,060 --> 00:33:18,140
Speaker 1: Yeah, MCP can do anything.

601
00:33:18,660 --> 00:33:20,540
Speaker 2: MCP, again, it's a pipe.

602
00:33:21,020 --> 00:33:22,260
Speaker 1: What you do with that pipe is up to you.

603
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:23,080
Speaker 1: Yeah.

604
00:33:23,860 --> 00:33:31,240
Speaker 1: Well, let's talk about how one might build such pipes with Python.

605
00:33:31,370 --> 00:33:35,960
Speaker 1: So there's actually a model context protocol GitHub organization.

606
00:33:36,970 --> 00:33:39,100
Speaker 1: Within there, they have the Python-SDK,

607
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:42,260
Speaker 1: the official Python SDK for the MCP servers and clients.

608
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:45,360
Speaker 1: So that's also interesting, the clients bit.

609
00:33:46,780 --> 00:33:47,860
Speaker 1: So maybe we could kind of like,

610
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:51,260
Speaker 1: there's a lot of concepts and things here,

611
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:53,660
Speaker 1: and I don't want to dive too much into code,

612
00:33:53,780 --> 00:33:58,000
Speaker 1: but maybe we could work our way through some of the concepts and some of the steps of building

613
00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:04,000
Speaker 2: such a thing. Yeah, totally. Well, I mean, it all starts from just getting the SDK, right? And this

614
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:09,179
Speaker 2: is for like anybody that's using Python. You can just get it through pip or uv. I'm a big fan of

615
00:34:09,460 --> 00:34:13,620
Speaker 2: the folks at Astral. I think they're doing a fantastic job with uv and uvx. Like I use it for

616
00:34:13,780 --> 00:34:20,500
Speaker 2: GitHub spec kit. So, you know, uv add MCP, MCP CLI. And there you go. You can be on your way. It's as

617
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:29,040
Speaker 1: simple as that yeah okay that'll do it and then um yeah you can specify like the cli options or

618
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:35,320
Speaker 1: whatever kind you want yeah yeah and also it's using fast mcp are you familiar with fast mcp

619
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:41,700
Speaker 1: no i know some projects with fast in it but not mcp yeah so fast mcp is basically think of it like

620
00:34:41,820 --> 00:34:47,440
Speaker 2: fast api for mcp uh it's essentially like allowing you to compose mcp servers faster because it has

621
00:34:47,379 --> 00:34:51,840
Speaker 2: a lot of the primitives baked in. So things like authorization, which can be like kind of a pain

622
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:58,140
Speaker 2: point. But if you use Fast MCP, it makes it a little easier. And Fast MCP is a integral part

623
00:34:58,340 --> 00:35:04,400
Speaker 2: of the Python SDK story for the actual like official Python SDK. Right. The programming model

624
00:35:04,660 --> 00:35:13,620
Speaker 1: looks like it would feel quite familiar to anyone who knows the Flask API or beyond. I think it's

625
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:20,240
Speaker 1: Just a little sidebar, I think it's really interesting how Flask is quite popular, but

626
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:26,660
Speaker 1: it's also spawned almost every single web app after it has kind of borrowed its programming

627
00:35:26,820 --> 00:35:26,980
Speaker 1: model.

628
00:35:27,420 --> 00:35:32,620
Speaker 1: So even if you're not exactly using Flask, if you're using Litestar or FastAPI or whatever,

629
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:35,040
Speaker 1: you're still kind of doing that kind of programming.

630
00:35:35,180 --> 00:35:36,620
Speaker 1: And it's the same here, right?

631
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:39,060
Speaker 1: You create an MCP as the app.

632
00:35:39,260 --> 00:35:46,900
Speaker 1: You say at mcp.tool or at mcp.prompt, and you put these onto functions, and they now become webized.

633
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:52,220
Speaker 2: Isn't that like, okay, I write Python, but I'm not a Python expert.

634
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:54,900
Speaker 2: I'm sorry, Brett Cannon, if you're watching this.

635
00:35:56,619 --> 00:35:57,840
Speaker 1: We'll take that part out, don't we?

636
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:00,740
Speaker 2: As the stream's live, that's okay.

637
00:36:04,179 --> 00:36:07,300
Speaker 2: So in Python, do you call them decorators or is it like attributes?

638
00:36:07,790 --> 00:36:08,700
Speaker 2: In C#, it's attributes.

639
00:36:09,060 --> 00:36:10,080
Speaker 1: - Yeah, and C# is attributes,

640
00:36:10,310 --> 00:36:11,120
Speaker 1: you do it with square brackets.

641
00:36:11,290 --> 00:36:13,280
Speaker 1: In Python, it's decorators,

642
00:36:13,330 --> 00:36:14,240
Speaker 1: you can do it with the @ symbol.

643
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:16,200
Speaker 2: - Okay, so the decorators themselves.

644
00:36:16,420 --> 00:36:17,760
Speaker 2: Look at like the simplicity of this.

645
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:19,500
Speaker 2: We're looking at the screen right now of a sample

646
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:23,960
Speaker 2: where we're looking at the actual Python SDK repo.

647
00:36:24,450 --> 00:36:25,020
Speaker 2: And one of the samples,

648
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:26,560
Speaker 2: you literally have a Python function,

649
00:36:26,590 --> 00:36:27,680
Speaker 2: you have def add,

650
00:36:28,030 --> 00:36:29,600
Speaker 2: and there is like your arguments,

651
00:36:29,690 --> 00:36:31,180
Speaker 2: you would pass through a function, like two integers.

652
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:34,560
Speaker 2: And then all you need to do to make that a tool

653
00:36:34,740 --> 00:36:37,000
Speaker 2: that an LM can invoke is just add that

654
00:36:37,180 --> 00:36:38,240
Speaker 2: @mcp.tool decorator.

655
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:45,320
Speaker 2: That's it. You're not going and crafting elaborate JSON RPC envelopes and converters and all these things.

656
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:49,020
Speaker 2: All the stuff is done for you. Add a decorator, boom, you have a tool. That's it.

657
00:36:50,300 --> 00:36:53,500
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's really, really simple to program.

658
00:36:54,160 --> 00:37:02,280
Speaker 1: And there's actually some fairly complicated data exchange stuff going on, like streaming partial results as they come in.

659
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:05,200
Speaker 1: Because we're all used to two things.

660
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:07,720
Speaker 1: AI requests taken a real long time.

661
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:11,480
Speaker 1: but B, that you see the little dots thinking, thinking,

662
00:37:11,630 --> 00:37:14,140
Speaker 1: and periodically, like some stuff that's coming by to like,

663
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:16,420
Speaker 1: oh yeah, okay, I see where it's going.

664
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:18,640
Speaker 1: I don't know what it's going to come up with,

665
00:37:18,690 --> 00:37:20,220
Speaker 1: but at least we could see it's working, right?

666
00:37:20,330 --> 00:37:21,920
Speaker 1: So to sort of keep that flow going,

667
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:24,640
Speaker 1: you've got the streaming style, right?

668
00:37:25,319 --> 00:37:25,680
Speaker 2: Exactly.

669
00:37:26,390 --> 00:37:28,460
Speaker 2: And all of this is like, again, I'm looking at the sample.

670
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:31,060
Speaker 2: It's so, the way I would describe it

671
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:32,880
Speaker 2: is a delightful developer experience.

672
00:37:33,180 --> 00:37:36,500
Speaker 2: If I'm a developer, I focus on writing the core functions.

673
00:37:36,790 --> 00:37:37,800
Speaker 2: I don't have to worry about like,

674
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:39,000
Speaker 2: well, how do I make this into a tool?

675
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:39,900
Speaker 2: Put a decorator on.

676
00:37:40,020 --> 00:37:40,660
Speaker 2: That's how you make it a tool.

677
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:42,520
Speaker 1: Yeah, excellent.

678
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:45,540
Speaker 1: So I have this server.

679
00:37:46,780 --> 00:37:50,660
Speaker 1: And you mentioned that it's a FastAPI or Flask-like.

680
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:52,860
Speaker 1: How do I host it?

681
00:37:53,220 --> 00:37:57,180
Speaker 1: Once I call run or whatever I do on it, then what?

682
00:37:58,140 --> 00:37:58,360
Speaker 1: I know.

683
00:37:58,360 --> 00:37:59,860
Speaker 1: I probably don't put it straight on the internet.

684
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:00,300
Speaker 1: Maybe I do.

685
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:00,760
Speaker 1: I don't know.

686
00:38:01,460 --> 00:38:03,000
Speaker 2: So there's two types of servers that you can have.

687
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,540
Speaker 2: You can have local MCP servers.

688
00:38:05,260 --> 00:38:07,000
Speaker 2: And local MCP servers are essentially

689
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:09,260
Speaker 2: just a local application.

690
00:38:09,820 --> 00:38:11,000
Speaker 2: Think of it running like a console app

691
00:38:11,300 --> 00:38:12,760
Speaker 2: or like your regular Python script.

692
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:13,700
Speaker 2: And what it does,

693
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:15,660
Speaker 2: they might be referred to,

694
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:17,340
Speaker 2: you might hear like they're called STDIO

695
00:38:17,580 --> 00:38:18,640
Speaker 2: for standard input output.

696
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:21,960
Speaker 2: And it's using basically native OS constructs

697
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:24,320
Speaker 2: to talk between processes, right?

698
00:38:24,380 --> 00:38:25,860
Speaker 2: The MCP client and the server.

699
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:28,440
Speaker 2: So again, it's still JSON RPC,

700
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:30,360
Speaker 2: but JSON RPC over STDIO pipes.

701
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:34,320
Speaker 2: So the other one is streamable HTTP.

702
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:37,260
Speaker 2: On stream of HTTP, it's an MCP server

703
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:39,740
Speaker 2: that can be hosted somewhere in the cloud.

704
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:42,680
Speaker 2: It can be hosted on your own home lab server if you want to,

705
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:43,880
Speaker 2: and you give it an IP address.

706
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:47,460
Speaker 2: You can be hosted in AWS or Azure GCP,

707
00:38:48,020 --> 00:38:48,940
Speaker 2: it doesn't really matter.

708
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:53,280
Speaker 2: So for those servers, the JSON-RPC messages

709
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:54,760
Speaker 2: are basically done through the HTTP pipe

710
00:38:54,980 --> 00:38:56,260
Speaker 2: with some set of HTTP conventions.

711
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:57,920
Speaker 2: That's kind of where it is.

712
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:01,720
Speaker 2: There's no constraint as to where you have to host it.

713
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:04,580
Speaker 2: it's whoever supports running Python

714
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:06,400
Speaker 2: can host your MCT server.

715
00:39:07,100 --> 00:39:07,420
Speaker 2: - Right, okay.

716
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:11,640
Speaker 2: So I could put it behind engine X or caddy or whatever.

717
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:13,960
Speaker 2: - Like toss it into a container and put it somewhere.

718
00:39:14,820 --> 00:39:15,840
Speaker 1: Like it's totally fine.

719
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:17,000
Speaker 1: - Okay.

720
00:39:18,020 --> 00:39:19,740
Speaker 1: You know, you talked about all these sort of different

721
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:24,340
Speaker 1: like private, but online, but not quite online,

722
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:25,940
Speaker 1: you know, with like a home lab and stuff.

723
00:39:26,740 --> 00:39:29,060
Speaker 1: I just want to give a shout out to tail scale.

724
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:29,600
Speaker 1: Like have you,

725
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:31,420
Speaker 1: Have you tailscaled lately?

726
00:39:31,740 --> 00:39:32,700
Speaker 1: Oh, it is so good.

727
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:33,640
Speaker 2: It is wonderful.

728
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:34,640
Speaker 2: I love tailscaled.

729
00:39:35,140 --> 00:39:36,240
Speaker 2: It's my go-to thing.

730
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:37,140
Speaker 2: And I'll tell you this.

731
00:39:37,260 --> 00:39:39,680
Speaker 2: Like, do you remember the days when you had to work?

732
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:42,480
Speaker 2: This episode is not sponsored by tailscaled, for the record.

733
00:39:43,579 --> 00:39:44,060
Speaker 2: Should be.

734
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:44,660
Speaker 1: Should be.

735
00:39:44,740 --> 00:39:45,360
Speaker 1: They can reach out.

736
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:45,480
Speaker 1: Yeah.

737
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:46,360
Speaker 2: Yeah.

738
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:47,400
Speaker 2: Yeah.

739
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:48,620
Speaker 2: Yeah.

740
00:39:48,660 --> 00:39:49,500
Speaker 2: Michael Talks is awesome.

741
00:39:49,540 --> 00:39:50,160
Speaker 2: You should sponsor it.

742
00:39:50,220 --> 00:39:51,440
Speaker 2: But anyway, so tailscaled is great.

743
00:39:51,580 --> 00:39:55,080
Speaker 2: Like, remember the olden days when you had to, like, set up an open VPN and be like, let

744
00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:55,940
Speaker 2: me generate the keys.

745
00:39:56,600 --> 00:40:01,900
Speaker 2: Let me email myself the key so I can open it on the iPhone and then add the key and then go through this process.

746
00:40:02,130 --> 00:40:04,640
Speaker 2: And it's just like, oh, man, such a pain.

747
00:40:04,980 --> 00:40:05,480
Speaker 2: Such a pain.

748
00:40:05,620 --> 00:40:08,260
Speaker 2: And tail scale, just like flip the switch and you're in.

749
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:09,560
Speaker 1: Yeah.

750
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:10,260
Speaker 1: Magic.

751
00:40:10,260 --> 00:40:12,360
Speaker 1: Or DynDNS where you.

752
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:13,480
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.

753
00:40:13,570 --> 00:40:16,580
Speaker 2: Because you have to bind your IP address to their domain.

754
00:40:17,150 --> 00:40:20,040
Speaker 2: And then you have to run this agent to constantly update it.

755
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:20,760
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.

756
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:22,820
Speaker 1: The agent goes down, your IP changes.

757
00:40:23,020 --> 00:40:26,540
Speaker 1: Well, then there's also all the NAT firewall and your local machine on your local network

758
00:40:26,700 --> 00:40:26,840
Speaker 1: change.

759
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:27,680
Speaker 1: You're like, no, it doesn't work.

760
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:32,680
Speaker 1: Oh, it's my machine on my, we had a power outage when the router rebooted.

761
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:33,480
Speaker 1: I got a new IP.

762
00:40:33,580 --> 00:40:35,420
Speaker 1: It just, it was so bad.

763
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:38,200
Speaker 1: And so why is this sidebar worth going into here, folks?

764
00:40:39,039 --> 00:40:41,340
Speaker 1: Because this is what's called an overlay network.

765
00:40:42,140 --> 00:40:46,280
Speaker 1: And so you can put it up on your iPhone, you can put it on your laptop, you can put it on

766
00:40:46,340 --> 00:40:46,700
Speaker 1: your desktop.

767
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:48,800
Speaker 1: You can put it on your Linux server if you want.

768
00:40:48,940 --> 00:40:54,400
Speaker 1: And it basically exposes all of those things over a network

769
00:40:54,620 --> 00:40:57,280
Speaker 1: that's like a VPN, but the rest of your behavior

770
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:59,280
Speaker 1: is just not VPN.

771
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:00,080
Speaker 1: It's just normal.

772
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:03,540
Speaker 1: But it just brings those in in just the most incredible way.

773
00:41:03,700 --> 00:41:07,760
Speaker 1: So for example, I have a high-end Mac mini here

774
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:10,440
Speaker 1: that I use for the streaming that I'm talking to you on now.

775
00:41:10,460 --> 00:41:12,560
Speaker 1: It has tons of RAM and there's a Prochip and stuff.

776
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:17,620
Speaker 1: So I just have my one LLM and my database servers running there.

777
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:22,380
Speaker 1: And when I'm doing dev work, instead of my laptop,

778
00:41:22,590 --> 00:41:24,300
Speaker 1: my other machine, always running in replica,

779
00:41:24,780 --> 00:41:26,500
Speaker 1: it all just goes here to this.

780
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:30,140
Speaker 1: And even if I'm in a coffee shop or I'm out for work,

781
00:41:30,420 --> 00:41:33,300
Speaker 1: as long as Tailscale's running, I do a database query

782
00:41:33,780 --> 00:41:37,100
Speaker 1: or an LLM call through an API, and it just hits this thing

783
00:41:38,060 --> 00:41:38,780
Speaker 1: just as if I was here.

784
00:41:38,870 --> 00:41:39,980
Speaker 1: And it's glorious.

785
00:41:40,070 --> 00:41:40,880
Speaker 1: And all that's for free, right?

786
00:41:41,060 --> 00:41:42,640
Speaker 1: There's paid versions, but you can do a lot.

787
00:41:42,780 --> 00:41:43,960
Speaker 2: Yeah, you can do a lot for free.

788
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:45,920
Speaker 2: In their free tier, it's amazing.

789
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:47,480
Speaker 2: And it's all WireGuard.

790
00:41:47,820 --> 00:41:50,840
Speaker 2: It's all using kind of the most modern secure standards.

791
00:41:51,380 --> 00:41:59,100
Speaker 2: I'll say like to me, like if you want to access things like, oh, your security cameras at home, you do not trust cloud providers to have access to your security home cameras.

792
00:42:00,180 --> 00:42:01,860
Speaker 2: Put them on your local network and use tail scale.

793
00:42:02,180 --> 00:42:05,140
Speaker 2: And then you can go somewhere, flip the switch in your phone.

794
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:05,560
Speaker 2: Boom.

795
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:08,860
Speaker 2: You can see your cameras from remote without exposing them to the broader Internet.

796
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:09,320
Speaker 1: It's amazing.

797
00:42:09,820 --> 00:42:13,060
Speaker 1: You don't open up any ports on your router, nothing like that.

798
00:42:13,540 --> 00:42:16,340
Speaker 1: So why am I going on such an excited diversion?

799
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:20,520
Speaker 1: One, it's just so awesome, and I just recently discovered it this year, so it's a thing.

800
00:42:22,460 --> 00:42:23,640
Speaker 1: But it's relevant.

801
00:42:23,830 --> 00:42:34,980
Speaker 1: If you've got an MCP server and you want to keep it local, even local from your server back to your company or something potentially, you could hide all that stuff behind Tailscale.

802
00:42:35,180 --> 00:42:41,060
Speaker 1: It's transparently available, but also there's no ports, there's no open internet.

803
00:42:41,300 --> 00:42:44,560
Speaker 1: The easiest way to secure stuff is to just not let the internet have at it.

804
00:42:45,260 --> 00:42:46,000
Speaker 2: Yep, no, exactly.

805
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:49,980
Speaker 2: This is what I've been actually doing with one of my friends who was setting up a home lab.

806
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:56,120
Speaker 2: And they were experimenting with some of the MCP servers for like, I believe it was like setting up for like a Minecraft server.

807
00:42:56,620 --> 00:42:58,000
Speaker 2: And we just tossed them on the same server.

808
00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:05,040
Speaker 2: And because it's tail scale and I connect them to the clients with a IP that tail scale gives me, it just magically works.

809
00:43:05,560 --> 00:43:07,180
Speaker 2: And I didn't need to expose this to the internet.

810
00:43:07,340 --> 00:43:10,240
Speaker 2: I didn't need to pay for any cloud providers in somebody's home lab.

811
00:43:10,580 --> 00:43:10,920
Speaker 2: It's just there.

812
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:11,900
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.

813
00:43:11,940 --> 00:43:13,780
Speaker 1: And you don't need to use SSH across it.

814
00:43:13,820 --> 00:43:15,240
Speaker 1: Like you can just, it's just there.

815
00:43:15,360 --> 00:43:16,380
Speaker 1: It's all super, super good.

816
00:43:17,740 --> 00:43:18,540
Speaker 1: Okay, back.

817
00:43:19,780 --> 00:43:20,720
Speaker 1: Back to what I was asking.

818
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:21,900
Speaker 1: Back to MCP from our...

819
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:23,540
Speaker 1: Back to MCP, but I was asking,

820
00:43:23,660 --> 00:43:24,400
Speaker 1: how do you run it?

821
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:26,400
Speaker 1: And you're like, we could run it on our home lab

822
00:43:26,500 --> 00:43:28,160
Speaker 1: or on Raspberry Pi or something, right?

823
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:31,760
Speaker 1: This tail scale thing is a way to sort of really nicely

824
00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:34,200
Speaker 1: make that available to you.

825
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:38,700
Speaker 1: Make that available to your AI agents or whatever

826
00:43:39,080 --> 00:43:41,380
Speaker 1: without going, well, now how do I host it

827
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:43,600
Speaker 1: on like a server for real?

828
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:44,500
Speaker 1: Yeah.

829
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:54,500
Speaker 1: okay so let's see that is the registry there we go so i want to talk about a couple things

830
00:43:54,980 --> 00:44:00,820
Speaker 1: we talked about tools yeah and we talked about there's prompts there's resources let's maybe go

831
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:05,680
Speaker 1: through each one real quick these are all just decorators you put on functions but they're all

832
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:09,859
Speaker 1: they're slightly different yeah what is the purpose of a tool and why would i do that

833
00:44:10,300 --> 00:44:13,680
Speaker 2: yeah a tool basically is a function call right it's like you you're

834
00:44:15,420 --> 00:44:20,220
Speaker 2: tool equals function that's the way i describe it like that's basically like hey i want the llm to

835
00:44:20,220 --> 00:44:27,620
Speaker 2: go do something what does it need to do and this is where like get weather give me the sum it needs

836
00:44:27,700 --> 00:44:34,180
Speaker 2: to go and do this is what a tool is it's a primitive that does something insert record into

837
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:40,900
Speaker 1: database or whatever this looks like you could probably find and replace fast mcp with fast api

838
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:46,640
Speaker 1: and tool with get yeah yeah and and you or a post or something and you might be able to pretty much

839
00:44:46,940 --> 00:44:53,100
Speaker 1: that is kind of the closest match right yeah exactly yep yep that's basically it it's

840
00:44:53,240 --> 00:44:58,840
Speaker 2: i want to invoke some kind of action go do that action for me right and exactly at least in the

841
00:44:58,740 --> 00:45:04,980
Speaker 1: examples, there's no AI in the action. It's just... No. The AI knows that it needs to invoke the

842
00:45:05,060 --> 00:45:10,440
Speaker 2: action. Like if I go to the LLM and say, send an email to Michael that says the podcast was awesome.

843
00:45:11,080 --> 00:45:16,200
Speaker 2: And then it's going to go in and say, oh, let me go find the tool that is capable of sending emails.

844
00:45:16,500 --> 00:45:21,100
Speaker 2: Oh, there's a tool from like, I don't know, like MailChimp. Okay, let me go do that. There's a

845
00:45:21,880 --> 00:45:25,780
Speaker 2: tool in the MailChimp MCP server that says send email. That sounds great. I'm going to use that

846
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:26,700
Speaker 2: to send the email, right?

847
00:45:27,080 --> 00:45:29,140
Speaker 2: And that tool itself doesn't use AI behind the scenes.

848
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:31,900
Speaker 2: It's just like, it's just going to do SMTP send email.

849
00:45:32,200 --> 00:45:32,660
Speaker 2: That's all it does.

850
00:45:33,260 --> 00:45:33,600
Speaker 2: Yeah.

851
00:45:34,110 --> 00:45:34,220
Speaker 2: Awesome.

852
00:45:36,060 --> 00:45:41,960
Speaker 1: It also has other examples of sort of data exchange along the way, I guess.

853
00:45:42,420 --> 00:45:42,680
Speaker 1: Absolutely.

854
00:45:43,270 --> 00:45:49,880
Speaker 1: You can pass in this context and then the context can start pushing updates and information

855
00:45:50,180 --> 00:45:52,700
Speaker 1: back to the user, right?

856
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:54,440
Speaker 1: And report progress back.

857
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:57,280
Speaker 2: So for example, if your email takes like seven hops,

858
00:45:57,300 --> 00:45:58,240
Speaker 2: it's like, okay, let me first connect

859
00:45:58,380 --> 00:45:59,580
Speaker 2: to this SMTP server.

860
00:45:59,640 --> 00:46:00,840
Speaker 2: Let me then verify the credentials.

861
00:46:01,580 --> 00:46:02,980
Speaker 2: Like you can encode that basically

862
00:46:03,260 --> 00:46:05,720
Speaker 2: if you implement that, you might not,

863
00:46:06,120 --> 00:46:07,840
Speaker 2: but you can implement progress reporting

864
00:46:07,900 --> 00:46:09,200
Speaker 2: so that the client knows like,

865
00:46:09,240 --> 00:46:11,700
Speaker 2: oh, you're like 30% through your task

866
00:46:12,020 --> 00:46:13,680
Speaker 2: or you're like 40% through your task now

867
00:46:13,820 --> 00:46:15,600
Speaker 2: because it reports on the progress of what you're doing.

868
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:17,340
Speaker 1: Yeah, super cool.

869
00:46:18,700 --> 00:46:20,180
Speaker 1: You can also do structured output,

870
00:46:21,020 --> 00:46:21,920
Speaker 1: which is pretty interesting.

871
00:46:22,840 --> 00:46:24,700
Speaker 1: There's many ways in which it can be done,

872
00:46:24,980 --> 00:46:30,120
Speaker 1: but the number one way, as in if it was an ordered list,

873
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:32,900
Speaker 1: the first thing, would be Pydantic models, right?

874
00:46:34,100 --> 00:46:37,200
Speaker 1: Carrying on the FastAPI analogy here, right?

875
00:46:37,860 --> 00:46:38,240
Speaker 2: Yeah.

876
00:46:38,660 --> 00:46:38,780
Speaker 2: Yep.

877
00:46:38,920 --> 00:46:40,440
Speaker 2: For a lot of these things, again, it's very--

878
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:42,560
Speaker 2: if you're a Python developer, a lot of these concepts

879
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:43,780
Speaker 2: are going to be very much familiar to you.

880
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:48,560
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think one of the challenges people have often

881
00:46:48,580 --> 00:46:51,220
Speaker 1: is structured data versus--

882
00:46:51,840 --> 00:46:53,200
Speaker 1: I got an LLM answer.

883
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:55,540
Speaker 1: And it's a little different every time.

884
00:46:56,780 --> 00:47:00,780
Speaker 1: And they upgraded the model from 5.1 to 5.15.

885
00:47:01,110 --> 00:47:02,760
Speaker 1: And now it does something totally different.

886
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:05,160
Speaker 1: How do I code against this?

887
00:47:05,660 --> 00:47:08,760
Speaker 1: And so using structured data can be a big bonus, right?

888
00:47:09,100 --> 00:47:09,260
Speaker 1: Yeah.

889
00:47:11,119 --> 00:47:11,640
Speaker 1: OK.

890
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:13,240
Speaker 1: Super cool.

891
00:47:13,620 --> 00:47:14,520
Speaker 1: Let's see prompts.

892
00:47:15,060 --> 00:47:17,000
Speaker 1: Now it's starting to sound AI-like.

893
00:47:17,900 --> 00:47:21,340
Speaker 2: Yeah, so this is basically like the description says,

894
00:47:21,540 --> 00:47:24,540
Speaker 2: prompts are reusable templates that help LLMs interact with your server effectively.

895
00:47:26,100 --> 00:47:29,580
Speaker 2: If you have a server that does, I don't know, cooking recipes,

896
00:47:29,780 --> 00:47:34,740
Speaker 2: it might provide prompts for like what are the steps for a recipe

897
00:47:34,830 --> 00:47:36,120
Speaker 2: and what substitutions were needed.

898
00:47:36,340 --> 00:47:40,580
Speaker 2: So it allows you to basically pre-cook prompts that your server might be using.

899
00:47:41,980 --> 00:47:42,120
Speaker 1: Okay.

900
00:47:43,260 --> 00:47:45,740
Speaker 1: They might be passing these internally to...

901
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:47,780
Speaker 2: - Yes, yeah.

902
00:47:48,120 --> 00:47:49,960
Speaker 1: - Or they return to the host AI.

903
00:47:50,390 --> 00:47:51,860
Speaker 1: You know, there's a lot of AIs involved here.

904
00:47:52,760 --> 00:47:54,200
Speaker 2: - Right, you know, essentially like,

905
00:47:54,380 --> 00:47:55,860
Speaker 2: think of like you're exposing prompt templates.

906
00:47:56,720 --> 00:47:57,640
Speaker 2: Like that's what it is.

907
00:47:57,670 --> 00:47:59,000
Speaker 2: Like, and saying like, oh, if you're a user,

908
00:47:59,160 --> 00:48:00,820
Speaker 2: if you're looking for like creating a recipe,

909
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:02,840
Speaker 2: this is a template for that prompt for a recipe.

910
00:48:04,420 --> 00:48:05,140
Speaker 1: - Okay, cool.

911
00:48:06,079 --> 00:48:08,580
Speaker 1: There's also a little bit of a UI component,

912
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:09,520
Speaker 1: which is interesting.

913
00:48:09,650 --> 00:48:15,260
Speaker 1: You can have a iconography representation of your actions.

914
00:48:15,900 --> 00:48:18,140
Speaker 2: Yeah, this is relatively new, but basically for some of them,

915
00:48:18,210 --> 00:48:22,220
Speaker 2: like bake in some of the icons to just make it easier to differentiate

916
00:48:22,410 --> 00:48:23,020
Speaker 2: between different actions.

917
00:48:23,130 --> 00:48:26,380
Speaker 2: Because especially, again, like different servers can have different tools

918
00:48:26,580 --> 00:48:27,300
Speaker 2: and there are many tools.

919
00:48:27,370 --> 00:48:28,980
Speaker 2: And how do you like just parse the strings?

920
00:48:29,050 --> 00:48:30,200
Speaker 2: Like just look at iconography.

921
00:48:31,380 --> 00:48:31,500
Speaker 1: Yeah.

922
00:48:32,440 --> 00:48:35,900
Speaker 1: Another thing that it has built in support for is working with images.

923
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:37,860
Speaker 1: So that's pretty wild.

924
00:48:39,560 --> 00:48:42,160
Speaker 2: Yeah, I've noticed that for a lot of the stuff, it's also like it's baked into the,

925
00:48:42,380 --> 00:48:45,120
Speaker 2: these are not necessarily like MCP spec constructs.

926
00:48:45,160 --> 00:48:47,880
Speaker 2: is more like how the Python SDK exposes them

927
00:48:47,910 --> 00:48:49,200
Speaker 2: and allows you to operate on them, right?

928
00:48:49,300 --> 00:48:51,060
Speaker 2: Because like the fundamental constructs,

929
00:48:51,060 --> 00:48:52,420
Speaker 2: the primitives are we have tools,

930
00:48:52,830 --> 00:48:53,440
Speaker 2: we have prompts,

931
00:48:54,100 --> 00:48:56,400
Speaker 2: there is resources, which is another one.

932
00:48:56,570 --> 00:48:57,500
Speaker 2: And the resources is,

933
00:48:58,020 --> 00:48:59,720
Speaker 2: allows the LM to basically think of it

934
00:48:59,940 --> 00:49:02,680
Speaker 2: as how do you refer to databases

935
00:49:03,320 --> 00:49:06,460
Speaker 2: or files or entities within an API?

936
00:49:07,640 --> 00:49:09,740
Speaker 2: Those are, there's also elicitations

937
00:49:09,940 --> 00:49:11,460
Speaker 2: as what Michael's showing right now on the screen.

938
00:49:11,840 --> 00:49:14,000
Speaker 2: So we have elicitations is a way

939
00:49:14,020 --> 00:49:16,760
Speaker 2: for an MCP server to go to the client and say,

940
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:20,620
Speaker 2: I want the client to provide me structured input

941
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:21,440
Speaker 2: on a specific question.

942
00:49:21,590 --> 00:49:24,880
Speaker 2: Like, hey, can you give us your date of birth?

943
00:49:26,319 --> 00:49:28,060
Speaker 2: And I expect a date.

944
00:49:28,740 --> 00:49:30,400
Speaker 2: Can you give me a date back exactly

945
00:49:30,450 --> 00:49:33,220
Speaker 2: so I don't need to guess from the LLM context, right?

946
00:49:33,600 --> 00:49:35,280
Speaker 2: Or it can say like, you know,

947
00:49:35,810 --> 00:49:37,060
Speaker 2: what kind of pet do you have?

948
00:49:37,060 --> 00:49:38,960
Speaker 2: And it can give you a list of options

949
00:49:39,220 --> 00:49:40,380
Speaker 2: that you can actually have to pick from.

950
00:49:40,410 --> 00:49:42,540
Speaker 2: It's like, oh, dog, you know, pet, reptile,

951
00:49:42,740 --> 00:49:49,100
Speaker 2: like dog cat reptile whatever um it allows you have that structured controlled input that it's

952
00:49:49,100 --> 00:49:54,620
Speaker 2: not just you're typing into the chat box but you're selecting from a list that the server asks you to

953
00:49:55,070 --> 00:49:59,380
Speaker 1: so that's another neat thing that recently got added yeah that looks that looks quite

954
00:49:59,560 --> 00:50:04,260
Speaker 1: interesting it has to do with a little bit with the web socket type of exchange

955
00:50:05,640 --> 00:50:11,420
Speaker 1: as well right yeah not not exactly but it's going along it you've asked it something while it's

956
00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:15,160
Speaker 1: working on that it's come back and it's asking you to give it more information to carry on

957
00:50:15,490 --> 00:50:19,780
Speaker 1: yes exactly in that sense right yep yep so could this be

958
00:50:22,860 --> 00:50:28,800
Speaker 1: i i've worked on your requests i've used the database mcp or whatever and i've learned that

959
00:50:28,920 --> 00:50:32,380
Speaker 1: there's 20 records do you want to delete them like you asked or do you not want to delete them

960
00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:39,240
Speaker 2: yes yes exactly that or it can say hey i found like 10 conflicting records which ones do i need

961
00:50:39,240 --> 00:50:45,380
Speaker 2: to delete and then you can help and basically do yeah right so it it asks for structured input so

962
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:51,240
Speaker 2: that you don't have to have it guess from whatever you type in the chat because if you type in the

963
00:50:51,320 --> 00:50:55,960
Speaker 2: chat it's like it's non-deterministic right because oh delete all the records with the name

964
00:50:56,280 --> 00:51:00,980
Speaker 2: john doe and it's like oh i'll delete everything with doe because somehow like that's what it

965
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:09,200
Speaker 2: decides like oh no jane come back yeah um so it adds a little bit more structure yeah got it

966
00:51:09,220 --> 00:51:11,860
Speaker 1: And the programming model is super smooth here.

967
00:51:11,900 --> 00:51:12,840
Speaker 1: They did a great job.

968
00:51:13,300 --> 00:51:17,100
Speaker 1: So for example, you might be doing this elicitation

969
00:51:17,360 --> 00:51:18,800
Speaker 1: within a tool call.

970
00:51:19,800 --> 00:51:21,960
Speaker 1: And that's an async function, async web function.

971
00:51:22,440 --> 00:51:25,840
Speaker 1: And the way you do it is just await context.elicit

972
00:51:25,980 --> 00:51:27,360
Speaker 1: some message and schema.

973
00:51:28,920 --> 00:51:33,300
Speaker 1: And then when the person responds, the async thing

974
00:51:33,560 --> 00:51:34,600
Speaker 1: resumes, and off you go.

975
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:38,180
Speaker 1: There's not some nested callbacks and all that kind of business.

976
00:51:38,660 --> 00:51:40,120
Speaker 1: That's a very smooth developer experience.

977
00:51:40,230 --> 00:51:40,720
Speaker 1: I love it.

978
00:51:41,080 --> 00:51:42,420
Speaker 1: Yeah, it definitely is.

979
00:51:44,140 --> 00:51:44,300
Speaker 1: Okay.

980
00:51:46,980 --> 00:51:56,300
Speaker 1: I do want to talk about some of the popular ones out there through an awesome list because I'm just a sucker for awesome lists.

981
00:51:56,840 --> 00:52:02,180
Speaker 1: But is there anything else that you feel like we should be covering here on the SDK?

982
00:52:02,900 --> 00:52:06,600
Speaker 2: Yeah, there's a lot of great work done with the Python SDK and the FastMCP folks.

983
00:52:06,680 --> 00:52:09,480
Speaker 2: I would say like go through the repo.

984
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:12,060
Speaker 2: It's github.com/model context protocol

985
00:52:12,190 --> 00:52:13,900
Speaker 2: slash python dash SDK.

986
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:15,480
Speaker 2: Go there.

987
00:52:16,020 --> 00:52:17,860
Speaker 2: There's some great samples to get you started.

988
00:52:18,340 --> 00:52:20,520
Speaker 2: And again, we're always open to feedback.

989
00:52:20,570 --> 00:52:22,160
Speaker 2: So if something's like, oh, this was too confusing.

990
00:52:22,230 --> 00:52:22,800
Speaker 2: I didn't understand.

991
00:52:22,890 --> 00:52:25,160
Speaker 2: The team is very receptive to feedback.

992
00:52:25,250 --> 00:52:26,120
Speaker 2: So please let them know.

993
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:26,880
Speaker 1: Yeah.

994
00:52:27,820 --> 00:52:28,700
Speaker 1: 143 contributors.

995
00:52:29,940 --> 00:52:31,220
Speaker 1: Last release five days ago.

996
00:52:34,200 --> 00:52:35,960
Speaker 1: Bunch of PRs, right?

997
00:52:36,080 --> 00:52:42,000
Speaker 1: It looks like it's pretty open, you know, 600 closed PRs, pretty open to people working.

998
00:52:42,340 --> 00:52:55,500
Speaker 1: Also, it looks kind of very beginner friendly in the sense that the issues are tagged with lots of stuff that you could search for, like needs motivation.

999
00:52:55,880 --> 00:53:01,380
Speaker 1: You know, you could go through and come up with some examples and help, even if you're not an expert in the SDK, for example.

1000
00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:02,140
Speaker 2: Absolutely.

1001
00:53:02,500 --> 00:53:05,940
Speaker 2: And there's also, I believe the Python might be using the good first issue, too.

1002
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,400
Speaker 2: So if you're a new contributor, you've never looked at it,

1003
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:10,800
Speaker 2: it's like, don't be intimidated.

1004
00:53:11,100 --> 00:53:11,540
Speaker 2: There's plenty of-

1005
00:53:11,600 --> 00:53:12,820
Speaker 2: Yeah, good first issue.

1006
00:53:12,820 --> 00:53:13,820
Speaker 2: Good first issue.

1007
00:53:13,820 --> 00:53:17,000
Speaker 2: Like there's plenty of things that you can just drop in

1008
00:53:17,010 --> 00:53:21,080
Speaker 2: and see like, oh, I can help with that.

1009
00:53:21,370 --> 00:53:21,480
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1010
00:53:23,220 --> 00:53:23,740
Speaker 1: Love it.

1011
00:53:23,740 --> 00:53:23,980
Speaker 1: Okay.

1012
00:53:23,980 --> 00:53:25,160
Speaker 1: You too can be an AI developer.

1013
00:53:25,160 --> 00:53:25,860
Speaker 1: I love it.

1014
00:53:25,860 --> 00:53:28,720
Speaker 1: Now let's talk about awesome MCP servers.

1015
00:53:28,870 --> 00:53:30,400
Speaker 1: Awesome MCP servers.

1016
00:53:31,700 --> 00:53:35,260
Speaker 1: This comes to us from the very well-known Punk Pie.

1017
00:53:35,640 --> 00:53:37,100
Speaker 2: The person behind Glamour.ai.

1018
00:53:37,940 --> 00:53:38,400
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1019
00:53:39,240 --> 00:53:39,440
Speaker 1: Awesome.

1020
00:53:39,720 --> 00:53:42,680
Speaker 1: And 72,000 GitHub stars, no joke.

1021
00:53:42,860 --> 00:53:46,960
Speaker 1: So there may be a fad, but maybe people will stick around.

1022
00:53:46,980 --> 00:53:47,260
Speaker 1: I don't know.

1023
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:51,060
Speaker 1: So this actually has support for a lot of different languages.

1024
00:53:51,800 --> 00:53:56,140
Speaker 1: And it's got scopes like it's cloud or local or embedded and so on.

1025
00:53:56,160 --> 00:53:58,200
Speaker 1: But then you scroll down.

1026
00:53:59,420 --> 00:54:00,180
Speaker 1: Look at the list.

1027
00:54:00,460 --> 00:54:00,820
Speaker 1: It's massive.

1028
00:54:00,860 --> 00:54:03,500
Speaker 1: The list is, I mean, look at the scroll bar.

1029
00:54:04,640 --> 00:54:05,560
Speaker 2: It is massive.

1030
00:54:05,900 --> 00:54:07,380
Speaker 1: Yeah, we keep scrolling and scrolling.

1031
00:54:07,760 --> 00:54:08,320
Speaker 1: I don't know.

1032
00:54:08,320 --> 00:54:12,500
Speaker 1: If I page down full speed and just pin page down the pinch down button,

1033
00:54:13,220 --> 00:54:17,140
Speaker 1: it's something along the lines of like five seconds just to get through the list.

1034
00:54:17,140 --> 00:54:18,280
Speaker 1: And these are one per line.

1035
00:54:18,730 --> 00:54:26,320
Speaker 1: So, you know, it starts out as one should when they're building awesome lists with categories, right?

1036
00:54:26,500 --> 00:54:32,160
Speaker 1: Command line, cloud platforms, biology medicine and bioinformatics.

1037
00:54:33,920 --> 00:54:34,880
Speaker 1: There's one for everything.

1038
00:54:35,560 --> 00:54:35,940
Speaker 1: I know.

1039
00:54:36,600 --> 00:54:38,460
Speaker 1: You want to just jump around a bit and we can see what's here

1040
00:54:38,510 --> 00:54:39,660
Speaker 1: when you riff on it?

1041
00:54:39,950 --> 00:54:40,040
Speaker 1: Gaming.

1042
00:54:40,760 --> 00:54:44,300
Speaker 2: MCB server for Unity 3D game engine integration for game to own.

1043
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:44,980
Speaker 2: That's kind of cool.

1044
00:54:46,900 --> 00:54:47,940
Speaker 2: Go.Unity MCB.

1045
00:54:48,080 --> 00:54:48,680
Speaker 2: MCB chess.

1046
00:54:49,280 --> 00:54:51,820
Speaker 2: An MCB server playing chess against LLMs.

1047
00:54:53,220 --> 00:54:55,740
Speaker 2: Did you ever think of like, can I beat an LLM at chess?

1048
00:54:56,620 --> 00:54:58,600
Speaker 2: And you want to just get an MCB server to do that?

1049
00:54:58,660 --> 00:54:59,600
Speaker 2: There is one for that.

1050
00:55:00,360 --> 00:55:02,599
Speaker 1: I'm starting to feel like it's better to do the local models

1051
00:55:02,620 --> 00:55:04,000
Speaker 1: for the chess playing against me one.

1052
00:55:05,540 --> 00:55:07,000
Speaker 1: I don't want the really smart ones.

1053
00:55:07,700 --> 00:55:09,680
Speaker 1: There's also chess MCP, which is,

1054
00:55:10,040 --> 00:55:10,500
Speaker 1: this is interesting.

1055
00:55:10,680 --> 00:55:12,660
Speaker 1: It's not the same as the other one.

1056
00:55:12,720 --> 00:55:15,400
Speaker 1: This is accessyourchess.com player data

1057
00:55:15,600 --> 00:55:17,340
Speaker 1: and records and other public info.

1058
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:18,560
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1059
00:55:18,720 --> 00:55:18,840
Speaker 1: Right.

1060
00:55:19,480 --> 00:55:19,920
Speaker 1: That's kind of cool.

1061
00:55:19,960 --> 00:55:20,740
Speaker 1: So if you wanted to say,

1062
00:55:20,840 --> 00:55:22,840
Speaker 1: hey, I'm building something

1063
00:55:23,160 --> 00:55:24,800
Speaker 1: and I would like access to

1064
00:55:25,300 --> 00:55:27,400
Speaker 1: sort of the Kaggle of chess players type of thing, right?

1065
00:55:27,640 --> 00:55:30,340
Speaker 1: Like the list of competitive chess results.

1066
00:55:31,020 --> 00:55:31,220
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1067
00:55:31,220 --> 00:55:31,620
Speaker 1: That's kind of cool.

1068
00:55:31,880 --> 00:55:31,980
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1069
00:55:32,140 --> 00:55:32,280
Speaker 2: Yeah.

1070
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:38,680
Speaker 2: yeah i i personally have built one for uh halo i'm a big fan of halo the video game yeah and i

1071
00:55:38,980 --> 00:55:42,820
Speaker 2: it's not on the list which now i need to go and contribute to that list okay let's do a pr

1072
00:55:43,500 --> 00:55:48,740
Speaker 2: like that that's the thing that i have is basically analyze my halo stats and i'll tell

1073
00:55:48,740 --> 00:55:53,240
Speaker 2: you what the lms are getting really good at analyzing the stats you give them the data

1074
00:55:53,820 --> 00:55:59,739
Speaker 1: they can make some conclusions yeah i bet let's just keep it really um crazy let's do

1075
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:00,920
Speaker 1: I was going to do delivery.

1076
00:56:00,940 --> 00:56:01,500
Speaker 1: We'll do that in a moment.

1077
00:56:01,700 --> 00:56:01,960
Speaker 1: Marketing.

1078
00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:03,280
Speaker 1: Marketing.

1079
00:56:04,240 --> 00:56:04,380
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1080
00:56:05,120 --> 00:56:05,260
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1081
00:56:05,420 --> 00:56:08,080
Speaker 1: So I guess one of the things that looks,

1082
00:56:08,320 --> 00:56:10,460
Speaker 1: I'm after just a very quick first impression,

1083
00:56:10,720 --> 00:56:13,580
Speaker 1: like you're running ads on someone's platform

1084
00:56:13,880 --> 00:56:15,280
Speaker 1: or you're doing marketing on someone's platform,

1085
00:56:15,720 --> 00:56:17,640
Speaker 1: but you want visibility into how that's going.

1086
00:56:18,020 --> 00:56:20,820
Speaker 1: So we've got the Facebook ads and PC server.

1087
00:56:20,980 --> 00:56:23,100
Speaker 1: We've got the Google ads, MCP server,

1088
00:56:23,340 --> 00:56:25,580
Speaker 1: and Amazon ads and so on, right?

1089
00:56:25,740 --> 00:56:26,520
Speaker 1: But what else is, yeah,

1090
00:56:26,600 --> 00:56:28,700
Speaker 1: that sounds about like most of it there, I suppose.

1091
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:29,160
Speaker 2: Yeah.

1092
00:56:29,520 --> 00:56:30,540
Speaker 2: But think of it this way.

1093
00:56:30,590 --> 00:56:33,660
Speaker 2: Like if you connect several of these MCP servers to your client,

1094
00:56:34,140 --> 00:56:36,960
Speaker 2: then you connect them to all your ads accounts and then say,

1095
00:56:37,100 --> 00:56:40,880
Speaker 2: how are my ads performing and which ones of them are the best this past week?

1096
00:56:42,420 --> 00:56:42,500
Speaker 2: Right?

1097
00:56:42,700 --> 00:56:45,440
Speaker 2: Like I don't need to click around dashboards and figure out like the filters

1098
00:56:45,730 --> 00:56:46,000
Speaker 2: and everything.

1099
00:56:46,120 --> 00:56:48,140
Speaker 2: Just ask the LLM, pull the data, make a conclusion.

1100
00:56:49,140 --> 00:56:51,360
Speaker 2: Now you still need to verify the conclusion that make sure it's not

1101
00:56:51,540 --> 00:56:52,100
Speaker 2: hallucinating things.

1102
00:56:52,300 --> 00:56:55,460
Speaker 2: But nonetheless, it's kind of cool.

1103
00:56:56,600 --> 00:56:57,180
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's very cool.

1104
00:56:58,220 --> 00:57:03,260
Speaker 1: So one thing I realize now that we skipped over the Python SDK is we talked all about the server.

1105
00:57:03,450 --> 00:57:04,660
Speaker 1: What about client things?

1106
00:57:04,880 --> 00:57:12,760
Speaker 1: If I wanted to create an MCP server that is effectively the composition of some other MCP servers, could I do that?

1107
00:57:13,300 --> 00:57:14,480
Speaker 1: You absolutely can.

1108
00:57:14,920 --> 00:57:15,480
Speaker 2: Nothing stops you.

1109
00:57:15,590 --> 00:57:21,000
Speaker 2: An MCP server can also act as an MCP client and then connect to other MCP servers.

1110
00:57:22,420 --> 00:57:23,820
Speaker 2: There's no restriction to that, right?

1111
00:57:24,200 --> 00:57:24,360
Speaker 2: Nice.

1112
00:57:25,240 --> 00:57:26,740
Speaker 2: It's basically, it's very composable.

1113
00:57:26,840 --> 00:57:33,940
Speaker 2: And a client, for all intents and purposes, is basically an entity that can connect to an MCP server, which can also be an MCP server.

1114
00:57:34,060 --> 00:57:34,600
Speaker 2: It's kind of circular.

1115
00:57:35,300 --> 00:57:35,700
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1116
00:57:36,700 --> 00:57:36,800
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1117
00:57:37,440 --> 00:57:38,420
Speaker 1: It's turtles all the way down.

1118
00:57:38,600 --> 00:57:39,500
Speaker 1: But MCP this time.

1119
00:57:40,260 --> 00:57:40,340
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1120
00:57:40,600 --> 00:57:41,500
Speaker 1: It's AI turtles this time.

1121
00:57:41,980 --> 00:57:45,180
Speaker 1: So delivery, we just have the DoorDash delivery MCP server.

1122
00:57:45,660 --> 00:57:46,300
Speaker 1: Oh, man.

1123
00:57:46,740 --> 00:57:49,860
Speaker 1: Hey, Claude, why is my food not here?

1124
00:57:50,320 --> 00:57:53,260
Speaker 1: Have you ever seen those fail videos or whatever?

1125
00:57:53,680 --> 00:57:55,760
Speaker 1: I watch weird YouTube stuff with my daughter sometimes,

1126
00:57:55,980 --> 00:57:59,540
Speaker 1: and you'll see cops delivering DoorDash.

1127
00:57:59,640 --> 00:58:01,780
Speaker 1: We'll say, sorry, we had to arrest your DoorDash delivery,

1128
00:58:02,100 --> 00:58:04,500
Speaker 1: but we were pretty close, so we thought we'd just go and deliver your food.

1129
00:58:05,280 --> 00:58:06,960
Speaker 1: I mean, I don't know what the server's going to say,

1130
00:58:07,080 --> 00:58:08,000
Speaker 1: but it could say anything.

1131
00:58:08,680 --> 00:58:09,860
Speaker 1: The police are on their way.

1132
00:58:10,820 --> 00:58:13,040
Speaker 1: Yeah, people are generally really appreciative.

1133
00:58:13,160 --> 00:58:14,760
Speaker 1: Like, well, thanks for getting me my dinner anyway.

1134
00:58:16,080 --> 00:58:17,240
Speaker 1: Let's see what else is out here.

1135
00:58:19,520 --> 00:58:21,480
Speaker 1: Got text-to-speech, which is interesting.

1136
00:58:22,660 --> 00:58:23,060
Speaker 1: Sports.

1137
00:58:23,420 --> 00:58:23,820
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.

1138
00:58:25,120 --> 00:58:26,160
Speaker 2: Oh, look at the Strava.

1139
00:58:26,440 --> 00:58:31,460
Speaker 2: If you're running or biking, you can use this also to analyze your data.

1140
00:58:31,620 --> 00:58:34,080
Speaker 2: There's a lot of MCB servers for data analysis, which is kind of cool.

1141
00:58:34,900 --> 00:58:38,900
Speaker 1: Okay, I don't even – this one, this is the one that appeals to me.

1142
00:58:39,080 --> 00:58:43,260
Speaker 1: So, Multivewer, this is actually not a thing that I would want,

1143
00:58:43,740 --> 00:58:45,160
Speaker 1: but I think it's interesting.

1144
00:58:45,360 --> 00:58:48,860
Speaker 1: So, Multivewer is a motorsports desktop client.

1145
00:58:48,960 --> 00:58:54,880
Speaker 1: And what I think it does, it does for IndyCar, WAC, Formula One, and even like the feeder classes.

1146
00:58:55,960 --> 00:59:04,480
Speaker 1: I think what it lets you do is put up both an overlay of telemetry onto watching the live stream,

1147
00:59:04,620 --> 00:59:10,480
Speaker 1: but also put the multiple people up in live streams at the same time or something like that, right?

1148
00:59:11,020 --> 00:59:11,680
Speaker 1: That's kind of cool.

1149
00:59:12,280 --> 00:59:12,760
Speaker 1: That's cool.

1150
00:59:13,020 --> 00:59:17,260
Speaker 1: So the reason I don't really like that is I don't watch any of those sports live.

1151
00:59:17,400 --> 00:59:19,000
Speaker 1: I record them and so I can then pause it

1152
00:59:19,480 --> 00:59:20,320
Speaker 1: and then skip the commercials.

1153
00:59:20,600 --> 00:59:22,720
Speaker 1: And so this is like for a live stream sort of deal,

1154
00:59:22,840 --> 00:59:28,200
Speaker 1: but the MCP server, it controls multi viewer for that.

1155
00:59:28,640 --> 00:59:29,980
Speaker 1: So maybe you could set up an AI

1156
00:59:30,300 --> 00:59:31,660
Speaker 1: that is watching what's going on

1157
00:59:32,280 --> 00:59:35,700
Speaker 1: and switches the views around in the multi viewer for you.

1158
00:59:36,340 --> 00:59:36,400
Speaker 1: - Yeah.

1159
00:59:37,260 --> 00:59:37,680
Speaker 1: - That's wild.

1160
00:59:38,740 --> 00:59:40,580
Speaker 2: - Or swaps to the most interesting telemetry

1161
00:59:40,780 --> 00:59:41,960
Speaker 2: at the specific moment.

1162
00:59:42,400 --> 00:59:43,660
Speaker 1: - Yeah, listen to the radio,

1163
00:59:43,800 --> 00:59:44,960
Speaker 1: they start getting all frantic.

1164
00:59:45,200 --> 00:59:46,360
Speaker 1: Like, all right, we're switching to that view.

1165
00:59:49,640 --> 00:59:54,280
Speaker 2: yeah there's an nc server for everything like this list is massive i'm actually like every time i

1166
00:59:54,460 --> 00:59:57,240
Speaker 2: discover these these things like we're looking at this right now i was like oh i didn't know there

1167
00:59:57,240 --> 01:00:00,460
Speaker 2: was one for multi-viewer like i didn't know what multi-viewer is until we talked right now

1168
01:00:00,960 --> 01:00:06,860
Speaker 1: yeah but wouldn't that be a cool demo yeah you know at a conference you're like i know you've

1169
01:00:06,940 --> 01:00:13,139
Speaker 1: all seen the tic-tac-toe one but let me show you the final of f1 yeah yeah something right

1170
01:00:13,920 --> 01:00:16,900
Speaker 2: various student observation because again like there's a lot of these like hello world kind of

1171
01:00:16,930 --> 01:00:20,420
Speaker 2: things like oh look it's kind of neat it responded with a thing like give me a real thing this is

1172
01:00:20,540 --> 01:00:28,320
Speaker 1: that real thing yeah yeah that's super neat all right i guess i've got the support one

1173
01:00:28,470 --> 01:00:33,100
Speaker 1: that lassie and jira quick chat just whatever you want right that's the one to reduce your boring

1174
01:00:33,320 --> 01:00:37,040
Speaker 2: work the jira mcp server like you don't want to triage your bugs just let the lm do it for you

1175
01:00:37,610 --> 01:00:40,379
Speaker 2: hey can you go and find the things that are most important for me to work on today

1176
01:00:41,080 --> 01:00:41,760
Speaker 2: give me the bug numbers.

1177
01:00:42,580 --> 01:00:44,920
Speaker 1: Or if you see somebody assign a bug to me

1178
01:00:44,980 --> 01:00:45,300
Speaker 1: close it.

1179
01:00:46,700 --> 01:00:47,100
Speaker 1: Exactly.

1180
01:00:47,960 --> 01:00:49,340
Speaker 2: Query all the bugs assigned to me

1181
01:00:49,860 --> 01:00:50,920
Speaker 2: reassign them to somebody else.

1182
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:55,460
Speaker 1: Yeah crazy.

1183
01:00:55,760 --> 01:00:55,960
Speaker 1: Exactly.

1184
01:00:57,280 --> 01:00:58,340
Speaker 1: Not a good fit for this person.

1185
01:00:59,200 --> 01:00:59,980
Speaker 2: No exactly.

1186
01:01:01,120 --> 01:01:02,540
Speaker 2: These are the life hacks you learn

1187
01:01:02,820 --> 01:01:03,580
Speaker 2: only from this podcast.

1188
01:01:04,140 --> 01:01:04,460
Speaker 1: That's right.

1189
01:01:04,780 --> 01:01:06,980
Speaker 1: If it involves MCP servers

1190
01:01:07,020 --> 01:01:08,000
Speaker 1: and cool stuff I can code

1191
01:01:08,120 --> 01:01:08,740
Speaker 1: give it to me otherwise.

1192
01:01:10,100 --> 01:01:10,960
Speaker 1: - Send it somewhere else.

1193
01:01:11,200 --> 01:01:12,100
Speaker 1: - Send it somewhere else.

1194
01:01:14,080 --> 01:01:15,700
Speaker 1: All right, Dan, I think we're getting pretty close

1195
01:01:15,880 --> 01:01:18,980
Speaker 1: on time here in terms of what we got time to cover,

1196
01:01:19,120 --> 01:01:20,060
Speaker 1: but this is super fun.

1197
01:01:21,620 --> 01:01:23,280
Speaker 1: Maybe close things out for folks.

1198
01:01:23,540 --> 01:01:25,980
Speaker 1: Like they want to get started with MCP servers,

1199
01:01:26,880 --> 01:01:28,640
Speaker 1: either building them, consuming them,

1200
01:01:28,760 --> 01:01:29,500
Speaker 1: building and consuming them,

1201
01:01:30,400 --> 01:01:32,340
Speaker 1: plugging them into their tool chain.

1202
01:01:33,120 --> 01:01:33,520
Speaker 1: What do you tell them?

1203
01:01:33,820 --> 01:01:35,360
Speaker 2: - Yeah, so for folks that want to build

1204
01:01:36,220 --> 01:01:38,500
Speaker 2: modelcontextprotocol.io, as simple as it gets,

1205
01:01:38,700 --> 01:01:41,740
Speaker 2: go there, it has guides, tutorials, SDK starters,

1206
01:01:42,260 --> 01:01:42,700
Speaker 2: everything is there.

1207
01:01:43,240 --> 01:01:46,840
Speaker 2: If you are a consumer of the MCPs and you are like,

1208
01:01:46,930 --> 01:01:49,320
Speaker 2: "Hey, I wanna do this like awesome thing with MC servers."

1209
01:01:49,480 --> 01:01:52,940
Speaker 2: First of all, the GitHub MCP registry that we showed earlier

1210
01:01:53,200 --> 01:01:57,220
Speaker 2: is one of those things is github.com/mcp, go explore.

1211
01:01:57,490 --> 01:01:59,040
Speaker 2: And then of course on GitHub,

1212
01:01:59,240 --> 01:02:01,200
Speaker 2: there's plenty of servers that are tagged with MCP.

1213
01:02:01,640 --> 01:02:02,600
Speaker 2: You can also take a look there.

1214
01:02:02,940 --> 01:02:06,519
Speaker 2: And there's other registries that also index MCP servers

1215
01:02:06,540 --> 01:02:09,640
Speaker 2: of all sorts, like Glama AI from Punk Pie

1216
01:02:09,850 --> 01:02:10,660
Speaker 2: that we talked about before,

1217
01:02:11,220 --> 01:02:13,140
Speaker 2: is one such registry that you can also look at

1218
01:02:13,140 --> 01:02:14,740
Speaker 2: and see if there's anything that's of interest.

1219
01:02:15,640 --> 01:02:19,240
Speaker 2: I will say that as you are exploring MCP servers,

1220
01:02:20,280 --> 01:02:21,160
Speaker 2: exercise caution,

1221
01:02:21,980 --> 01:02:24,100
Speaker 2: just like you would exercise with any other software

1222
01:02:24,700 --> 01:02:26,640
Speaker 2: and APIs and websites where you log in

1223
01:02:26,880 --> 01:02:29,940
Speaker 2: because the responsibility is kind of on you

1224
01:02:30,320 --> 01:02:32,920
Speaker 2: to figure out what's safe, what's not.

1225
01:02:32,980 --> 01:02:34,080
Speaker 2: If you have an MCP server that's like,

1226
01:02:34,080 --> 01:02:36,500
Speaker 2: oh, it's going to read all my iMessages

1227
01:02:36,900 --> 01:02:38,040
Speaker 2: and sort them by importance.

1228
01:02:38,140 --> 01:02:39,620
Speaker 2: I'm like, yes.

1229
01:02:40,200 --> 01:02:42,180
Speaker 2: And do you know who built that

1230
01:02:42,200 --> 01:02:43,460
Speaker 2: and where your messages are going?

1231
01:02:43,800 --> 01:02:45,220
Speaker 1: So be careful with that.

1232
01:02:45,260 --> 01:02:46,460
Speaker 1: Are they also scanning for credit card numbers?

1233
01:02:46,740 --> 01:02:46,900
Speaker 1: Exactly.

1234
01:02:47,320 --> 01:02:48,280
Speaker 1: Why not?

1235
01:02:48,760 --> 01:02:50,400
Speaker 2: You messaged somebody with your social security number

1236
01:02:50,560 --> 01:02:50,920
Speaker 2: the other day.

1237
01:02:51,080 --> 01:02:51,160
Speaker 2: Nice.

1238
01:02:52,320 --> 01:02:52,400
Speaker 2: Yeah.

1239
01:02:52,520 --> 01:02:53,560
Speaker 2: So be careful with those.

1240
01:02:53,560 --> 01:02:54,820
Speaker 2: But I'd say like explore them.

1241
01:02:55,020 --> 01:02:58,440
Speaker 2: And then we are working on formalizing

1242
01:02:58,620 --> 01:02:59,400
Speaker 2: discovery a bit better.

1243
01:02:59,600 --> 01:03:02,460
Speaker 2: So your clients like VS Code and Cursor

1244
01:03:02,560 --> 01:03:04,240
Speaker 2: and Claw Desktop are going to become better and better

1245
01:03:04,720 --> 01:03:06,140
Speaker 2: with more discoverability affordances.
