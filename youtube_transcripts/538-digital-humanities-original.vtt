00:00:01.540 --> 00:00:03.560
<v Michael Kennedy>Hello, David. Welcome to Talk Python To Me.

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:04.700
<v Michael Kennedy>Amazing to have you here.

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:06.800
<v David Flood>I'm glad to be here.

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:10.060
<v David Flood>Talk Python has been part of my story up to this point.

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:11.760
<v Michael Kennedy>Has it? Okay. Well,

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:15.180
<v Michael Kennedy>you are about to write the next chapter in the story.

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:16.500
<v Michael Kennedy>So that's pretty excellent.

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:19.000
<v Michael Kennedy>I have a sense of what's coming.

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:22.640
<v Michael Kennedy>We planned out what we're going to talk about and that sort of thing.

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:26.280
<v Michael Kennedy>And I'm really excited about this topic.

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:29.640
<v Michael Kennedy>So it's going to be a good one.

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:34.600
<v Michael Kennedy>Honestly, I think one of the real powers of the Python community

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:37.320
<v Michael Kennedy>and the reason the language has such staying power

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:44.900
<v Michael Kennedy>is there's such a diversity of use cases, technology standpoints, right?

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:48.640
<v Michael Kennedy>Like I build software for this group or I build these types of apps

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:50.680
<v Michael Kennedy>and it's not just, you know, like Ruby on Rails,

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:53.200
<v Michael Kennedy>which, you know, it's been very popular and stuff,

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:54.840
<v Michael Kennedy>but it's for websites, right?

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:55.260
<v Michael Kennedy>You know what I mean?

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:07.880
<v David Flood>Yeah, absolutely. I mean, web development has dominated my use of it, but my entry into it,

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:12.180
<v David Flood>which I suppose I'll mention in a moment, was through all those little tools.

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:21.540
<v Michael Kennedy>Was it? Okay. Yeah. Well, let's hear it. Who are you, David Flood? Introduce yourself real quick

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:23.300
<v Michael Kennedy>and tell us about how you got into it.

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.200
<v David Flood>Yep.

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:30.500
<v David Flood>So my background is in music and the humanities.

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:34.820
<v David Flood>I mean, in 2019, I didn't know what Python was

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:36.560
<v David Flood>or the name of any programming language.

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:41.060
<v David Flood>And I've been doing textual criticism,

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:46.060
<v David Flood>which is, you know, there's lots of criticisms in the academy.

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:49.320
<v David Flood>This is the one where if you have lots and lots of versions

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:56.620
<v David Flood>of the same text you are comparing them to to work out what the initial text was and like how

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:03.980
<v Michael Kennedy>it changed over time okay give it give us an example okay so uh one of the famous examples

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:09.880
<v David Flood>hope i can remember it off the top of my head um is from shakespeare we're all familiar with the

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:16.280
<v David Flood>line to be or not to be that is the question that is the question uh well there's a there's a variant

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:23.840
<v David Flood>of it. There's a variant of it. One of the early copies written by Shakespeare himself has...

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:29.420
<v David Flood>Somebody's going to be able to type into the chat exactly what it is. They'll know this anecdote,

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:38.180
<v David Flood>but it's something more like to be or not to be. I, that's the question. And so which one is the

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:42.860
<v David Flood>original one? Why did he change it? That's kind of one example. I work mainly in the New Testament,

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:53.600
<v David Flood>which is especially complicated because no other corpus from ancient history has as many copies of the same text as that corpus does.

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:56.740
<v David Flood>So it's quite complicated.

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:03.140
<v David Flood>And our techniques have grown because of that and perhaps become more advanced than other fields.

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:21.400
<v Michael Kennedy>I mean, that many variations over that huge span of time over different groups with different, maybe not intentions, but certainly colored by different worldviews and philosophies and so on.

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:23.420
<v Michael Kennedy>And yeah, I see the travel.

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:24.980
<v David Flood>No, yeah.

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:26.980
<v David Flood>And they were people of the book.

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:30.420
<v David Flood>So copying it is something that happened a lot.

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:34.680
<v David Flood>And they copied the monks, like the medieval monks copied everything.

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:38.640
<v David Flood>They copied, you know, our Greek classics.

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:41.900
<v David Flood>So that's what I was interested in.

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:48.980
<v David Flood>And because of the wealth of data that we have, computer tools are more and more important in that field.

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:55.780
<v David Flood>So when I started my PhD in 2019, I knew that I wanted to use some of these cutting edge tools.

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:57.940
<v David Flood>Some of them may be surprising.

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:03.640
<v David Flood>For example, we've been using phylogenetic software.

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:15.460
<v David Flood>This is software that evolutionary biologists are using or computational biologists are using to track, for example, how COVID strains like mutate over time.

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:16.680
<v Michael Kennedy>Oh, interesting.

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:20.380
<v David Flood>What they're comparing are the DNA letters.

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:24.320
<v David Flood>And so you have the sequence of letters and you're comparing how those change over time.

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:37.120
<v David Flood>Well, you can swap in textual variants for DNA letters, and now we can track how texts change over time and group them into families, things like that.

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:41.980
<v Michael Kennedy>It's like a time series, but of words or letters or something.

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:42.720
<v Michael Kennedy>Yeah, how interesting.

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:43.540
<v David Flood>Yeah, I mean, yeah.

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:50.720
<v David Flood>There's lots of important algorithms for comparing sequences of things.

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:58.360
<v David Flood>And so if we can just swap in Greek, you know, Greek words and Greek text instead, then we can maybe apply it to textual criticism.

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:00.380
<v David Flood>So I was pretty interested in those things.

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:07.660
<v David Flood>That wasn't actually the method that brought me into it, but something like that kind of computer intensive tools.

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:13.700
<v David Flood>What I learned is that these tools were not like they weren't actually available to me.

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:15.840
<v David Flood>They weren't desktop applications.

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:18.780
<v David Flood>And for the most part, they weren't public web applications.

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:20.660
<v David Flood>They were software libraries.

00:05:22.139 --> 00:05:25.780
<v Michael Kennedy>I see. So something on PyPI or something like that, right?

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:33.600
<v David Flood>Yeah, exactly. Exactly. Or Java. And I needed to glue them together. So the long story short on

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:39.300
<v David Flood>that is during the first year of my PhD, I was picking up Python, watching YouTube videos while

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:45.360
<v David Flood>I was doing the dishes. And then the pandemic hit while I was living in Edinburgh in Scotland,

00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:53.760
<v David Flood>probably not far from will mccougan um and uh so the pandemic gave me the excuse to spend even a

00:05:53.880 --> 00:06:00.500
<v David Flood>few more hours um you know each day um picking up these new these new technical skills uh but so i

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:06.780
<v David Flood>did it i was able to use these advanced tools in my in my work but what was really important to me

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:12.519
<v David Flood>was sharing like making that available to my colleagues as i had to i had to move from writing

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:17.800
<v David Flood>these like bad top to bottom Python scripts into things that could be reused by other people.

00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:23.140
<v David Flood>And that led me into the web because the web is where that's how I can share with anybody.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:33.020
<v Michael Kennedy>It's the easiest way. And it's really wild how much the web is kind of the last bastion of

00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:40.639
<v Michael Kennedy>app freedom. It's so bizarre because, you know, I've many times told the stories of the insane

00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:46.820
<v Michael Kennedy>battles of just getting our apps that just playback video of content that's already on the web

00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:53.560
<v Michael Kennedy>into the app store. I mean, weeks of fighting about the weirdest, most nonsensical things with

00:06:53.700 --> 00:07:01.280
<v Michael Kennedy>both Google and Apple. But we also now have the Mac platform and the Windows platform very

00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:07.380
<v Michael Kennedy>aggressively looking for digital code certificates and all sorts of signing and other kinds of,

00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:10.540
<v Michael Kennedy>You can't even just send somebody an executable anymore.

00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:12.640
<v Michael Kennedy>It won't run. It's crazy.

00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:15.840
<v Michael Kennedy>It's down to like, okay, put it on the web, I guess.

00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:21.200
<v David Flood>- That's right. I played the game of distributing desktop apps.

00:07:21.340 --> 00:07:21.880
<v David Flood>That's how I did it.

00:07:22.980 --> 00:07:24.420
<v David Flood>That's how I initially distributed things.

00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:28.840
<v David Flood>And at this point, I just require people to install Python

00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:31.560
<v David Flood>and then install my desktop app from PyPI

00:07:31.780 --> 00:07:34.660
<v David Flood>because it's too hard otherwise for me.

00:07:34.980 --> 00:07:38.960
<v David Flood>I mean, I could pay for the code signing from Apple and do all of that,

00:07:39.020 --> 00:07:42.200
<v David Flood>but it's just too much work for the time that I have.

00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:44.500
<v Michael Kennedy>Yeah, I'm about to do another round of it.

00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:48.060
<v Michael Kennedy>I'm working on an app, and my developer account is still active,

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:50.060
<v Michael Kennedy>so we might have a fresh round of fun.

00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:51.660
<v Michael Kennedy>Hopefully it goes through this time.

00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:54.540
<v Michael Kennedy>Anyway, I do think it's such a challenge.

00:07:54.740 --> 00:07:55.920
<v Michael Kennedy>And are you leveraging?

00:07:56.320 --> 00:07:57.560
<v Michael Kennedy>I don't know if the timing was right.

00:07:57.700 --> 00:07:58.700
<v Michael Kennedy>Maybe this was too early.

00:07:59.620 --> 00:08:03.980
<v Michael Kennedy>But these days, are you leveraging things like uvx to run,

00:08:04.340 --> 00:08:07.840
<v Michael Kennedy>or are you just pip install this thing and then run it?

00:08:08.899 --> 00:08:11.120
<v David Flood>Yeah, I haven't updated the readme in a while,

00:08:11.180 --> 00:08:13.180
<v David Flood>so I think it just asks for pip.

00:08:13.860 --> 00:08:17.340
<v David Flood>But certainly, if somebody asked me today,

00:08:17.980 --> 00:08:20.100
<v David Flood>I would say, "Yeah, just install this with uv."

00:08:20.640 --> 00:08:20.940
<v Michael Kennedy>Yeah, yeah.

00:08:21.100 --> 00:08:22.380
<v David Flood>Because then they don't even need Python.

00:08:23.300 --> 00:08:23.560
<v David Flood>Exactly.

00:08:23.900 --> 00:08:24.700
<v Michael Kennedy>If they get it,

00:08:25.020 --> 00:08:25.620
<v Michael Kennedy>and that's a really,

00:08:25.820 --> 00:08:28.340
<v Michael Kennedy>it is another barrier reduced

00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:29.420
<v Michael Kennedy>in distributing these applications.

00:08:30.700 --> 00:08:33.719
<v Michael Kennedy>If you can get uv installed on a machine,

00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:37.700
<v Michael Kennedy>then you don't even have to say install just the way you run it is uvx my thing

00:08:38.419 --> 00:08:44.980
<v Michael Kennedy>and it's all transparent to you right which is beautiful so what was it like yeah so what was

00:08:44.980 --> 00:08:55.920
<v Michael Kennedy>it like coming from what sounds like a not super screen focus super techie aspect and having to

00:08:56.100 --> 00:09:01.019
<v Michael Kennedy>dive into this world and someday you're probably like how is it that i'm publishing stuff to pypi

00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:08.160
<v David Flood>what has happened to me yeah uh well yeah i i remember when i when i first signed up for github

00:09:08.500 --> 00:09:12.140
<v David Flood>because you know whatever youtube tutorial i was working through at the time

00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:21.700
<v David Flood>um you know said that i need that that i needed to do that um you know i i think it all started

00:09:21.860 --> 00:09:28.379
<v David Flood>making a lot of sense um i didn't have any technical background but the uh the world

00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:36.560
<v David Flood>the world kind of open source software it it just it kind of made sense it felt like it fit really

00:09:36.740 --> 00:09:43.740
<v David Flood>well into my into my academic um you know circle yeah i think a lot of the attitudes are similar

00:09:44.540 --> 00:09:48.820
<v Michael Kennedy>i agree i think they are actually and i think that's i think that's a pretty neat thing

00:09:51.040 --> 00:09:58.379
<v Michael Kennedy>yeah very cool all right well let's talk about what you're doing with digital humanities you're

00:09:58.400 --> 00:10:03.960
<v Michael Kennedy>actually at a really interesting project or organization, I guess that does many projects,

00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:09.700
<v David Flood>right? Yeah, yeah. So fast, fast forwarding, I did, I finished my PhD in the humanities.

00:10:09.880 --> 00:10:15.500
<v Michael Kennedy>Yeah, sorry, I cut you off there, didn't I? That's fine. I had so much fun writing like these tools

00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:20.640
<v David Flood>and then just get it solving the distribution problem to share them with other scholars.

00:10:21.960 --> 00:10:27.120
<v David Flood>That was so fun that I was open to this kind of opportunity where now I'm doing this full time.

00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:36.940
<v David Flood>And so, yes, I so I'm on the we call it affectionately Darth, which is digital arts and humanities at Harvard.

00:10:37.840 --> 00:10:42.380
<v Michael Kennedy>Awesome. There has to be a lot of Star Wars memes and references, I'm sure.

00:10:43.060 --> 00:10:46.360
<v David Flood>If you can pull up a 404, I think there will be a Darth Vader.

00:10:47.240 --> 00:10:48.860
<v Michael Kennedy>Oh, seriously, I'm here for it.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:57.020
<v Michael Kennedy>Yes, page not found. I find your lack of nav disturbing.

00:10:59.660 --> 00:11:05.020
<v Michael Kennedy>you know what i think that is beautiful and i really i really think that people should embrace

00:11:05.540 --> 00:11:14.300
<v Michael Kennedy>the 404 the fun 404 page you know more right there should really be something going on that

00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:19.600
<v Michael Kennedy>like makes it you know something hasn't worked out but you can just you can make people laugh

00:11:20.420 --> 00:11:21.500
<v Michael Kennedy>but I appreciate that

00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:25.120
<v David Flood>I've heard people push back against it

00:11:25.240 --> 00:11:26.020
<v David Flood>like if you're on

00:11:27.560 --> 00:11:29.080
<v David Flood>your medical website

00:11:29.660 --> 00:11:31.320
<v David Flood>and you're maybe about to get bad news

00:11:31.460 --> 00:11:33.120
<v David Flood>and then you get like a picture of a kitten

00:11:35.780 --> 00:11:37.720
<v Michael Kennedy>Dr. Kitten doesn't know where your results went

00:11:37.820 --> 00:11:39.140
<v Michael Kennedy>I get that that's not funny

00:11:40.740 --> 00:11:42.840
<v Michael Kennedy>but I mean most things are not that serious

00:11:44.280 --> 00:11:44.760
<v Michael Kennedy>mostly

00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:47.560
<v Michael Kennedy>okay so what kind of things

00:11:47.960 --> 00:11:48.899
<v Michael Kennedy>does Darth do

00:11:49.120 --> 00:11:54.160
<v Michael Kennedy>You've described this as kind of a web or tech agency within Harvard.

00:11:55.020 --> 00:11:56.260
<v Michael Kennedy>Maybe more within the digital art group.

00:11:56.420 --> 00:11:57.060
<v David Flood>Yeah, it is very much.

00:11:57.060 --> 00:11:59.520
<v David Flood>So, you know, Harvard has a gigantic IT group.

00:12:00.040 --> 00:12:06.800
<v David Flood>I don't know how many hundreds of people work, but more than 500 people in IT.

00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:12.720
<v David Flood>We are a small team, and we operate very much like a small agency.

00:12:13.540 --> 00:12:22.160
<v David Flood>So usually what happens is a faculty member has a funded research project that's going to last for an amount of time.

00:12:23.410 --> 00:12:25.820
<v David Flood>And then we consult with them to build it.

00:12:27.240 --> 00:12:35.760
<v David Flood>And most of the time, I kind of think of these as I kind of have these different categories of these kinds of projects that I think of.

00:12:36.500 --> 00:12:36.900
<v David Flood>Mm-hmm.

00:12:43.520 --> 00:12:46.640
<v David Flood>I lost in my notes what I called them, but they are there.

00:12:46.780 --> 00:12:50.480
<v David Flood>You have like a one is like a virtual research environment.

00:12:51.460 --> 00:12:57.560
<v David Flood>So the focus is this is this is a platform that we're building for the research to be done.

00:12:58.080 --> 00:13:05.720
<v David Flood>Like the reason the research should be done in like a web app would be because you have access to visualization, to Postgres,

00:13:06.740 --> 00:13:12.620
<v David Flood>to pandas so you we can we can kind of build up this platform to do the actual research on

00:13:13.040 --> 00:13:19.220
<v Michael Kennedy>and some of the data entry all right so like a full-on research application yeah and i guess

00:13:19.240 --> 00:13:27.920
<v Michael Kennedy>you can also kind of see your work through the different stages of research projects and academic

00:13:28.100 --> 00:13:34.479
<v Michael Kennedy>research and so on and we'll get to maybe end of life in a sense uh further down down in the

00:13:34.500 --> 00:13:41.500
<v Michael Kennedy>conversation. But so this would be, we have a grant or we just work here and we're going to work on

00:13:41.920 --> 00:13:47.260
<v Michael Kennedy>some form of research. What do you give them? Right? Like, I think that's a super interesting

00:13:47.560 --> 00:13:55.140
<v Michael Kennedy>challenge because one of the real common answers would be Jupyter, JupyterLab, Marimo, whatever.

00:13:56.420 --> 00:14:03.940
<v Michael Kennedy>But that's still pretty code heavy for people who are possibly philosophers or something, you know,

00:14:04.420 --> 00:14:16.220
<v David Flood>Oh, exactly. That's why in digital humanities, I won't even, maybe I won't even attempt to define it in any narrow sense, because I'll get in trouble with somebody.

00:14:17.640 --> 00:14:33.700
<v David Flood>But you have two groups that are interfacing with each other. And one is digital humanities as a field, like as a subfield, all of its own. And these are people who have humanities domain, like knowledge, and technical skills.

00:14:34.140 --> 00:14:35.140
<v David Flood>and they're bringing them together.

00:14:35.720 --> 00:14:38.200
<v David Flood>And in a lot of cases, the audience for that kind of work

00:14:38.540 --> 00:14:41.060
<v David Flood>is other people working in the digital humanities.

00:14:42.320 --> 00:14:45.060
<v David Flood>But far more common, and this is what we work with,

00:14:45.240 --> 00:14:49.280
<v David Flood>is people who have humanities domain expertise

00:14:49.820 --> 00:14:52.840
<v David Flood>and they want to publish or do research or share

00:14:53.040 --> 00:14:57.060
<v David Flood>with other people who have that same humanities domain expertise

00:14:57.560 --> 00:15:01.400
<v David Flood>and they are now interested in adding a technical component to it.

00:15:01.640 --> 00:15:03.920
<v David Flood>How can we supercharge what they have?

00:15:06.360 --> 00:15:08.280
<v Michael Kennedy>Maybe just take a moment and speak to,

00:15:10.140 --> 00:15:14.640
<v Michael Kennedy>maybe I don't know if this venue will actually speak directly to anybody who I was imagining here,

00:15:14.760 --> 00:15:16.520
<v Michael Kennedy>but people who work with folks,

00:15:17.380 --> 00:15:23.560
<v Michael Kennedy>what would you tell somebody who works with a group who have some technical skill,

00:15:23.700 --> 00:15:25.920
<v Michael Kennedy>who could create some of these things that we're going to talk about,

00:15:26.600 --> 00:15:30.960
<v Michael Kennedy>but the people who they agree for don't necessarily think they need it or know that they need it.

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:38.460
<v Michael Kennedy>Like, you know, I've gone often on rants about how programming is a superpower, not a replacement for your job, right?

00:15:41.880 --> 00:15:51.240
<v David Flood>Yeah, that's a problem for a lot of people, especially because you might use some new computer tools to supercharge your research.

00:15:51.980 --> 00:15:59.200
<v David Flood>But the article that you publish or the research output of that, the audience, they may not be interested in hearing about that at all.

00:15:59.820 --> 00:16:10.380
<v David Flood>And so for most people who are working in this space, the tools, you have to use them in such a way that you can talk about the research output without talking about the tool.

00:16:11.360 --> 00:16:16.700
<v David Flood>And we have other venues to talk about the tools themselves, like the Journal for Open Source Software.

00:16:17.180 --> 00:16:19.100
<v David Flood>And you can kind of get some of it out there.

00:16:20.200 --> 00:16:26.500
<v David Flood>But that's the significant challenge is convincing people that it could be useful and then convincing

00:16:26.560 --> 00:16:31.620
<v David Flood>the audience that they should be interested in the methods behind how some of the new research

00:16:31.700 --> 00:16:32.080
<v David Flood>comes out.

00:16:32.980 --> 00:16:38.780
<v Michael Kennedy>Also, I think I'm a big believer that presenting stuff in the right order is really, really

00:16:39.180 --> 00:16:39.320
<v Michael Kennedy>important.

00:16:40.100 --> 00:16:44.240
<v Michael Kennedy>If you present your research and it's beautiful and powerful, and oh, look, we've also, by

00:16:44.320 --> 00:16:47.600
<v Michael Kennedy>the way, covered 100 times more data than any prior research.

00:16:48.160 --> 00:16:48.400
<v Michael Kennedy>Surprise.

00:16:48.520 --> 00:16:49.420
<v Michael Kennedy>I wonder how I did that.

00:16:50.120 --> 00:16:51.300
<v Michael Kennedy>And then people are like, this is amazing.

00:16:52.640 --> 00:16:55.640
<v Michael Kennedy>Then after you kind of hook them with the inspiration and what's possible,

00:16:55.740 --> 00:16:57.680
<v Michael Kennedy>then you're like, let me tell you about the tool.

00:16:57.800 --> 00:16:59.000
<v Michael Kennedy>Don't say that's a cool tool, right?

00:16:59.160 --> 00:17:03.080
<v Michael Kennedy>This is not just like geekery, like programmer, you know,

00:17:03.320 --> 00:17:05.079
<v Michael Kennedy>a Charlie Brown speak, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah.

00:17:05.319 --> 00:17:06.620
<v Michael Kennedy>You know, it's like, no, I'm listening.

00:17:06.839 --> 00:17:07.420
<v Michael Kennedy>Tell me now.

00:17:08.819 --> 00:17:09.280
<v David Flood>Yeah, exactly.

00:17:09.680 --> 00:17:12.839
<v David Flood>I mean, one of the things I think that really opens people's eyes

00:17:13.140 --> 00:17:15.579
<v David Flood>is a really powerful search interface.

00:17:16.380 --> 00:17:17.860
<v David Flood>You have all of this research data.

00:17:18.480 --> 00:17:22.180
<v David Flood>Just put it behind Elasticsearch with some really good filtering on it.

00:17:22.560 --> 00:17:27.880
<v David Flood>And all of a sudden you have fast, rapid access to the data in a way you never had before.

00:17:28.110 --> 00:17:34.440
<v David Flood>Like you were never scrolling through the Excel spreadsheets and finding exactly what you wanted, like you were with this new search interface.

00:17:35.420 --> 00:17:37.640
<v David Flood>And that by itself is like so simple.

00:17:37.710 --> 00:17:42.320
<v David Flood>We're so used to that in web development that like everything needs to have a fantastic search now.

00:17:43.320 --> 00:17:47.900
<v David Flood>But so many people have their data locked behind, you know, a terrible search interface.

00:17:48.540 --> 00:17:57.140
<v Michael Kennedy>Yeah. Yeah. Just a few things to sort of expose that. So this, give us a sense of what these data

00:17:57.300 --> 00:18:02.840
<v Michael Kennedy>exploration web apps might look like. These are probably kind of mostly stuck to the inside,

00:18:03.140 --> 00:18:09.160
<v Michael Kennedy>kind of internal to the research lab research team groups and so on. These are probably not

00:18:09.460 --> 00:18:15.499
<v David Flood>that public facing, right? Almost everything we work on does end up having a public facing

00:18:15.520 --> 00:18:24.000
<v David Flood>component. So maybe the research itself is done locked behind a user login that's just for the

00:18:24.240 --> 00:18:30.500
<v David Flood>researchers. But then they expose that research to the public, usually with a good search interface

00:18:31.040 --> 00:18:37.360
<v David Flood>and different pages for exploring their data and visualizations and things like that. So

00:18:38.420 --> 00:18:43.200
<v David Flood>yeah, everything we do ends up becoming a production public web app in the end.

00:18:44.340 --> 00:18:45.000
<v Michael Kennedy>- Yeah, awesome.

00:18:47.020 --> 00:18:50.100
<v Michael Kennedy>And then another one of your categories you put in

00:18:50.180 --> 00:18:52.360
<v Michael Kennedy>was virtual research environments,

00:18:52.500 --> 00:18:55.180
<v Michael Kennedy>like data entry, publishing, authoring, collaboration.

00:18:55.540 --> 00:18:56.020
<v Michael Kennedy>Tell us about that.

00:18:57.800 --> 00:18:59.920
<v David Flood>- Yeah, so a good example of this maybe

00:19:00.100 --> 00:19:01.420
<v David Flood>is one of the projects that,

00:19:04.140 --> 00:19:05.320
<v David Flood>well, actually the best example of it

00:19:05.380 --> 00:19:09.460
<v David Flood>is the project I worked on during my PhD.

00:19:10.340 --> 00:19:12.400
<v Michael Kennedy>It's called Apatosaurus.

00:19:13.740 --> 00:19:18.060
<v David Flood>short story behind the name is that it sounds like apparatus in textual

00:19:18.360 --> 00:19:24.200
<v David Flood>criticism when you are when you are displaying and visualizing variant

00:19:24.520 --> 00:19:29.460
<v David Flood>readings to a to a base text that like that that form of visualizing it is a

00:19:29.680 --> 00:19:35.420
<v David Flood>critical apparatus a critical apparatus is a pretty boring website name but a

00:19:35.540 --> 00:19:41.600
<v Michael Kennedy>patasaurus dinosaurs might make textual criticism sound fun yeah I do love

00:19:41.540 --> 00:19:47.040
<v Michael Kennedy>dinosaurs. No, that's really cool. So this comes out as a web app. And I know you also have some,

00:19:47.300 --> 00:19:53.440
<v Michael Kennedy>you talked about some desktop apps as well. Yeah, yeah, that's right. So yeah, so there's

00:19:53.560 --> 00:19:57.460
<v David Flood>people upload their collation to this, and then they can visualize it. And

00:20:01.020 --> 00:20:07.280
<v David Flood>like there's a public component of this as well. But really the back end is editing a collation,

00:20:07.720 --> 00:20:10.040
<v David Flood>adding notes to all of the different readings and stuff.

00:20:10.740 --> 00:20:15.320
<v David Flood>So I could show what the back end looks like,

00:20:15.520 --> 00:20:16.740
<v David Flood>but we can also move on.

00:20:19.840 --> 00:20:24.480
<v Michael Kennedy>Let's move on, just because most people will not tell you.

00:20:24.530 --> 00:20:31.120
<v Michael Kennedy>But just give us a sense of what do you create for people

00:20:31.300 --> 00:20:34.040
<v Michael Kennedy>so that they're like, yeah, I can use this app.

00:20:34.420 --> 00:20:36.500
<v Michael Kennedy>Give us a sense of some of the features, I guess,

00:20:36.680 --> 00:20:43.740
<v David Flood>what I'm getting to yeah so another another good example is we have what we

00:20:43.740 --> 00:20:50.460
<v David Flood>have project at Darth at Harvard called mapping color in history and this is a

00:20:52.719 --> 00:20:59.040
<v David Flood>collaboration with a lab this lab brings in pieces of artwork and they do like

00:20:59.120 --> 00:21:04.400
<v David Flood>spectral analysis on the pigments so they can identify like what was used to

00:21:04.360 --> 00:21:10.920
<v David Flood>make a particular color of this red or what was made to make this color of blue.

00:21:11.910 --> 00:21:17.160
<v David Flood>And then the idea is tracking how did people make those pigments over time,

00:21:17.960 --> 00:21:23.500
<v David Flood>over time, and specifically in Asian art.

00:21:24.180 --> 00:21:25.780
<v Michael Kennedy>Is this the Dharmra of Puna?

00:21:27.720 --> 00:21:31.400
<v David Flood>No, this is mapping color in history.

00:21:31.430 --> 00:21:33.140
<v Michael Kennedy>I don't think it's up here.

00:21:33.230 --> 00:21:33.700
<v David Flood>Sorry about that.

00:21:34.040 --> 00:21:40.620
<v Michael Kennedy>somewhere. That's all right. I'll find it. Keep talking. Okay. So, so the front end is great,

00:21:40.900 --> 00:21:46.220
<v David Flood>you know, the, like the public end, this is, people can, can explore by pigments and then

00:21:46.500 --> 00:21:51.940
<v David Flood>see the images that, that contain those pigments. Now in the back end, what the research,

00:21:52.480 --> 00:22:00.699
<v David Flood>researchers will be able to do is correlate exactly which point of a painting the analysis was done

00:22:00.720 --> 00:22:04.420
<v David Flood>that. So they have like this deep zoom image viewer where they'll zoom in and

00:22:04.480 --> 00:22:10.320
<v David Flood>they'll select the point where that was taken from. And so, you know, how else

00:22:10.440 --> 00:22:15.760
<v David Flood>would you do that other than a digital interface to indicate on an image of a

00:22:15.820 --> 00:22:20.120
<v David Flood>painting where that spectral analysis was performed?

00:22:21.580 --> 00:22:24.700
<v Michael Kennedy>Sounds almost like astronomy in a weird way.

00:22:24.720 --> 00:22:24.960
<v Michael Kennedy>Oh yeah.

00:22:27.180 --> 00:22:32.740
<v Michael Kennedy>We zoomed into here and we took a different spectrum of the painting and

00:22:32.780 --> 00:22:36.280
<v Michael Kennedy>we realized that it's actually identical to this, something crazy like that, right?

00:22:36.650 --> 00:22:37.320
<v David Flood>Yeah, yeah.

00:22:39.840 --> 00:22:40.080
<v Michael Kennedy>Nice.

00:22:40.220 --> 00:22:42.820
<v David Flood>That's right, yeah, so it's essentially a pigments database.

00:22:45.320 --> 00:22:46.360
<v Michael Kennedy>Yeah, wild.

00:22:47.960 --> 00:22:54.039
<v Michael Kennedy>So the third category of these digital humanities projects that you put down was

00:22:54.060 --> 00:22:56.060
<v Michael Kennedy>like data extraction, transformation.

00:22:58.740 --> 00:23:00.480
<v Michael Kennedy>In data science, they often say,

00:23:00.920 --> 00:23:03.080
<v Michael Kennedy>80% of the work is the data wrangling,

00:23:03.280 --> 00:23:05.220
<v Michael Kennedy>which is like cleaning, organization,

00:23:05.960 --> 00:23:07.320
<v Michael Kennedy>just getting it so you could possibly

00:23:07.500 --> 00:23:09.040
<v Michael Kennedy>start asking questions about it.

00:23:09.460 --> 00:23:10.600
<v Michael Kennedy>I'm sure you all do a lot of that.

00:23:11.240 --> 00:23:11.800
<v David Flood>- Absolutely.

00:23:13.500 --> 00:23:17.600
<v David Flood>So often the very beginning of a project

00:23:18.020 --> 00:23:23.120
<v David Flood>might be an Excel sheet or several spreadsheets.

00:23:24.380 --> 00:23:28.900
<v David Flood>And the first task is to ingest these into a proper database.

00:23:29.580 --> 00:23:31.460
<v David Flood>Not so much MongoDB for us.

00:23:31.820 --> 00:23:34.420
<v David Flood>It's going into Postgres or Django Shop.

00:23:35.960 --> 00:23:37.120
<v David Flood>So it's going into Postgres.

00:23:38.640 --> 00:23:44.280
<v David Flood>And yeah, no, that is probably the number one challenge of the early stage

00:23:45.040 --> 00:23:47.800
<v David Flood>is figuring out what the right data model is,

00:23:48.260 --> 00:23:51.700
<v David Flood>what the right relationships are to model the data.

00:23:52.320 --> 00:24:03.360
<v David Flood>Doing that work is advantageous to everybody because, you know, it helps both the researchers who brought the data to think about it in a more organized way.

00:24:03.810 --> 00:24:06.100
<v David Flood>I mean, they've been trying to do that and they have the spreadsheets.

00:24:06.980 --> 00:24:14.860
<v David Flood>But now we're modeling out the data so that we can add it to database tables and then to use later.

00:24:14.970 --> 00:24:16.400
<v David Flood>So that works out well for everybody.

00:24:17.120 --> 00:24:21.200
<v David Flood>And yeah, absolutely cleaning the data, getting dates,

00:24:21.460 --> 00:24:26.340
<v David Flood>working with fuzzy dates, being able to parse July of 2020

00:24:27.700 --> 00:24:31.680
<v David Flood>or summer of 2020 and handling kind of all of those cases

00:24:31.750 --> 00:24:33.840
<v David Flood>so that we do get dates in the end.

00:24:35.240 --> 00:24:38.800
<v Michael Kennedy>One of the crazy stories from data parsing history

00:24:39.060 --> 00:24:40.980
<v Michael Kennedy>is one of the--

00:24:41.540 --> 00:24:43.040
<v Michael Kennedy>I can't remember exactly what it was.

00:24:44.720 --> 00:24:47.800
<v Michael Kennedy>We talked about biology tools or genetics tools earlier.

00:24:47.880 --> 00:24:50.520
<v Michael Kennedy>One of the groups that names genes

00:24:50.940 --> 00:24:52.940
<v Michael Kennedy>had to change the name of a gene

00:24:53.140 --> 00:24:55.560
<v Michael Kennedy>because it kept getting parsed by Excel into a date.

00:24:56.980 --> 00:24:57.760
<v David Flood>- I remember that.

00:24:57.840 --> 00:24:58.940
<v Michael Kennedy>I remember that. - So crazy.

00:24:59.640 --> 00:25:00.040
<v David Flood>- Yes.

00:25:00.660 --> 00:25:02.440
<v Michael Kennedy>- So like these are the weird edge cases

00:25:02.640 --> 00:25:03.460
<v Michael Kennedy>I'm sure you run into.

00:25:05.200 --> 00:25:06.440
<v Michael Kennedy>Like it's not even supposed to be a date.

00:25:06.580 --> 00:25:07.240
<v Michael Kennedy>Why is this a date?

00:25:07.420 --> 00:25:08.640
<v Michael Kennedy>I don't know why is it a date?

00:25:08.720 --> 00:25:09.540
<v Michael Kennedy>Help me out here.

00:25:10.380 --> 00:25:11.160
<v Michael Kennedy>The code keeps crashing.

00:25:11.420 --> 00:25:13.820
<v Michael Kennedy>Like pandas parsed it as a date and it's not or whatever.

00:25:15.600 --> 00:25:16.360
<v David Flood>Yeah, absolutely.

00:25:16.680 --> 00:25:16.820
<v David Flood>Yeah.

00:25:16.940 --> 00:25:17.120
<v David Flood>Yeah.

00:25:17.260 --> 00:25:22.200
<v David Flood>So yeah, usually lots of test suites around that ingest process until we've got it.

00:25:22.420 --> 00:25:28.100
<v David Flood>Now, once we've got it in, usually the research is ongoing and then we're able to provide them

00:25:28.220 --> 00:25:33.800
<v David Flood>now a new cleaned interface to, to do the additional data entry as the project is going.

00:25:34.280 --> 00:25:35.660
<v David Flood>And that's usually a win-win for everybody.

00:25:36.200 --> 00:25:36.520
<v Michael Kennedy>Sure.

00:25:36.760 --> 00:25:43.380
<v Michael Kennedy>And so this sort of ETL ingestion side of everything is it's like, don't worry.

00:25:43.760 --> 00:25:47.300
<v Michael Kennedy>Darth has got it for you. And then we'll provide you like a

00:25:47.960 --> 00:25:51.620
<v Michael Kennedy>database connection to start working or do you give them the

00:25:51.780 --> 00:25:55.160
<v Michael Kennedy>tools and then they kind of iterate on them? And how much?

00:25:55.790 --> 00:25:58.340
<v Michael Kennedy>How much is this you and how much is this you providing like

00:25:58.400 --> 00:26:00.680
<v Michael Kennedy>CLI tools and stuff or notebooks over to people?

00:26:02.580 --> 00:26:06.660
<v David Flood>Our the I'd say most of the people that we're working with

00:26:06.820 --> 00:26:10.620
<v David Flood>are aware of the technical tools, but they don't want a

00:26:10.480 --> 00:26:15.640
<v David Flood>database connection. So we are giving them, we're doing the ingest and then building a platform

00:26:15.990 --> 00:26:21.980
<v Michael Kennedy>where they can begin interacting with their data. Yeah, I'm sure they don't want one.

00:26:23.470 --> 00:26:28.420
<v Michael Kennedy>Maybe you give them an app though, right, with like Elasticsearch and other things that they can...

00:26:28.470 --> 00:26:31.020
<v David Flood>No, absolutely. Yeah, that's what we do. Yeah, okay.

00:26:31.370 --> 00:26:36.860
<v David Flood>Yeah, we give them a web platform to begin exploring, to begin publishing.

00:26:38.960 --> 00:26:46.420
<v Michael Kennedy>So I was thinking that you said you're a Django shop, which is cool.

00:26:47.820 --> 00:26:51.760
<v Michael Kennedy>It sounds, though, to me like describing what you're doing, just imagining how this is.

00:26:52.400 --> 00:26:55.300
<v Michael Kennedy>You're probably creating these projects often.

00:26:56.720 --> 00:27:00.460
<v Michael Kennedy>How often does one of these projects actually last?

00:27:02.240 --> 00:27:04.240
<v Michael Kennedy>Or how many of them do you iterate?

00:27:05.740 --> 00:27:06.440
<v Michael Kennedy>I'm trying to get a sense.

00:27:06.680 --> 00:27:09.680
<v Michael Kennedy>Do you work on stuff for a year or is it like every two weeks we're on a new project?

00:27:11.100 --> 00:27:21.920
<v David Flood>It's why I think of us as like an agency because we get to work on greenfield projects fairly often, like you're imagining, which would not be the case normally at a big university IT department.

00:27:23.420 --> 00:27:28.860
<v David Flood>So, you know, maybe two or three projects a year, two or three big ones a year.

00:27:29.510 --> 00:27:35.960
<v David Flood>And then we have to put to bed a few a year as well because these things, they're funded with grant money.

00:27:36.440 --> 00:27:38.940
<v David Flood>and then the grant money runs out, and it's time.

00:27:39.180 --> 00:27:41.280
<v David Flood>And then we have to figure out, what do we do with it now?

00:27:41.340 --> 00:27:46.620
<v David Flood>We don't want to lose the data and this way of presenting it.

00:27:46.680 --> 00:27:48.700
<v David Flood>But we can't keep paying for Elasticsearch.

00:27:49.560 --> 00:27:50.200
<v Michael Kennedy>Yeah, of course.

00:27:50.800 --> 00:27:51.680
<v Michael Kennedy>Certainly, we're going to dive into that.

00:27:53.020 --> 00:27:54.360
<v Michael Kennedy>But let's save that for the end.

00:27:54.400 --> 00:27:57.500
<v Michael Kennedy>It seems like that's the arc of the story of these things.

00:27:57.600 --> 00:28:02.400
<v Michael Kennedy>But I certainly think it's something that you don't think about that much, right?

00:28:02.680 --> 00:28:06.240
<v Michael Kennedy>Like you said, it was only $100 a month for this, and we got a big grant.

00:28:06.380 --> 00:28:07.180
<v Michael Kennedy>There's a bunch of, no big deal.

00:28:07.210 --> 00:28:08.480
<v Michael Kennedy>But like when the grant's out,

00:28:08.680 --> 00:28:10.160
<v Michael Kennedy>who's on the hook for a hundred dollars a month

00:28:11.240 --> 00:28:13.260
<v Michael Kennedy>and making sure it survives upgrades

00:28:13.700 --> 00:28:15.260
<v Michael Kennedy>and all that kind of business.

00:28:16.660 --> 00:28:17.080
<v David Flood>No, that's right.

00:28:17.700 --> 00:28:17.780
<v Michael Kennedy>Yeah.

00:28:17.970 --> 00:28:21.240
<v Michael Kennedy>So my original question when I started on this path

00:28:21.400 --> 00:28:22.660
<v Michael Kennedy>was thinking like, do you,

00:28:25.380 --> 00:28:26.560
<v Michael Kennedy>how do you get started on these?

00:28:26.560 --> 00:28:27.900
<v Michael Kennedy>Do you have like a big framework

00:28:28.760 --> 00:28:30.440
<v Michael Kennedy>or a cookie cutter sort of thing or something?

00:28:30.530 --> 00:28:31.700
<v Michael Kennedy>Like this is how we do it

00:28:31.810 --> 00:28:33.520
<v Michael Kennedy>because it plugs into all this other automation

00:28:33.750 --> 00:28:35.920
<v Michael Kennedy>and tools we built for the last 10 projects.

00:28:36.400 --> 00:28:37.700
<v Michael Kennedy>You know, that's kind of a unique position.

00:28:39.400 --> 00:28:47.420
<v Michael Kennedy>A lot of companies build one website for themselves and that's their app or they're an agency that goes across so much variation they can't do that kind of stuff, right?

00:28:48.680 --> 00:28:49.060
<v David Flood>That's right.

00:28:49.620 --> 00:28:50.000
<v David Flood>That's right.

00:28:51.640 --> 00:28:52.240
<v David Flood>That's a good question.

00:28:52.840 --> 00:28:56.300
<v David Flood>We have things that we reuse.

00:28:56.540 --> 00:29:06.080
<v David Flood>Some of them are open source, different, you know, like search components and things that we maintain that we'll use across projects.

00:29:06.570 --> 00:29:09.900
<v David Flood>And we have tried to do the cookie cutter Django project.

00:29:10.720 --> 00:29:13.200
<v David Flood>The truth is each project is different enough.

00:29:13.640 --> 00:29:13.980
<v Michael Kennedy>Yeah.

00:29:14.440 --> 00:29:24.120
<v David Flood>Really, we like to evaluate it from first principles as we're evaluating it and thinking, what is the best technology to use?

00:29:26.920 --> 00:29:32.280
<v David Flood>Yeah, so we don't have a cookie cutter.

00:29:32.320 --> 00:29:38.520
<v David Flood>We don't have a kind of a meta framework for bootstrapping them because they're sufficiently different from each other.

00:29:40.639 --> 00:29:41.680
<v Michael Kennedy>I find that too.

00:29:42.820 --> 00:29:47.780
<v Michael Kennedy>The idea of how we could just grab this cookie cutter or copier.

00:29:47.880 --> 00:29:48.880
<v Michael Kennedy>Are you familiar with copier?

00:29:49.320 --> 00:29:50.740
<v Michael Kennedy>People out there might be familiar with that.

00:29:50.840 --> 00:29:56.360
<v Michael Kennedy>It's a little bit like cookie cutter with the bonus that you can update it later

00:29:56.800 --> 00:29:58.220
<v Michael Kennedy>if you change your mind about something,

00:29:58.300 --> 00:30:01.840
<v Michael Kennedy>like actually change this project to use Postgres rather than SQLite or something,

00:30:03.800 --> 00:30:04.480
<v Michael Kennedy>which is pretty cool.

00:30:04.640 --> 00:30:08.759
<v Michael Kennedy>But every time that I do, every time I try to work with one of those projects,

00:30:09.600 --> 00:30:11.900
<v Michael Kennedy>even ones that I've created for myself, I'm not hating on anyone.

00:30:12.380 --> 00:30:16.660
<v Michael Kennedy>I'm like, oh, it's like 75% awesome and 25% I just got to take this stuff out.

00:30:17.720 --> 00:30:19.600
<v Michael Kennedy>You know, I'll just do it from scratch.

00:30:19.700 --> 00:30:20.700
<v Michael Kennedy>It's not how hard is this?

00:30:20.780 --> 00:30:23.240
<v Michael Kennedy>I'll just create a few folders and put a few things in there,

00:30:23.740 --> 00:30:27.040
<v Michael Kennedy>and I'll copy the PyProject.tom, like the one thing that's like,

00:30:27.120 --> 00:30:27.900
<v Michael Kennedy>how do I do this again?

00:30:27.940 --> 00:30:29.620
<v Michael Kennedy>I'll just copy that, and we're good to go.

00:30:33.880 --> 00:30:35.460
<v David Flood>Yeah, I mean, that's what I find.

00:30:35.660 --> 00:30:36.220
<v David Flood>That's what I find.

00:30:36.440 --> 00:30:40.080
<v David Flood>I find it seems like a really brilliant idea, but in practice,

00:30:41.380 --> 00:30:42.920
<v David Flood>it hasn't saved us time yet.

00:30:44.080 --> 00:30:45.480
<v Michael Kennedy>No, I mean, maybe it's a case study.

00:30:45.620 --> 00:30:47.480
<v Michael Kennedy>Like, okay, let's see what they're doing for this one.

00:30:47.520 --> 00:30:49.360
<v Michael Kennedy>Oh, that is interesting how they're integrating

00:30:49.780 --> 00:30:52.580
<v Michael Kennedy>this other thing maybe, but as a true foundation,

00:30:52.720 --> 00:30:55.060
<v Michael Kennedy>I find it in theory awesome.

00:30:55.480 --> 00:30:58.080
<v Michael Kennedy>In practice, I just end up not doing it for various reasons.

00:30:58.440 --> 00:30:58.780
<v Michael Kennedy>Don't know why.

00:31:04.720 --> 00:31:05.680
<v Michael Kennedy>I'm going to save this for later.

00:31:06.460 --> 00:31:07.820
<v Michael Kennedy>Because the question I'm about to ask you

00:31:07.780 --> 00:31:10.760
<v Michael Kennedy>is going to send us just down a rat hole.

00:31:11.460 --> 00:31:17.300
<v Michael Kennedy>So instead, before we go down the rat hole, maybe we could, not that one, maybe we could

00:31:17.380 --> 00:31:23.340
<v Michael Kennedy>talk about, I mean, you talked about something, but let's maybe just feature some of the projects

00:31:23.520 --> 00:31:25.520
<v Michael Kennedy>that are maybe more well-known that you guys have done.

00:31:26.380 --> 00:31:26.480
<v David Flood>Sure.

00:31:27.060 --> 00:31:27.420
<v David Flood>Yeah, good.

00:31:28.020 --> 00:31:31.600
<v David Flood>So yeah, one of them is called the amendments project.

00:31:33.519 --> 00:31:37.380
<v David Flood>And this is, I didn't know this until I started working on this project.

00:31:37.600 --> 00:31:45.260
<v David Flood>that there have been thousands of, I think it's at least 22,000 proposed amendments

00:31:45.930 --> 00:31:49.600
<v David Flood>to the United States Constitution that never went anywhere.

00:31:50.530 --> 00:31:55.840
<v David Flood>And so kind of the goal of this project is to show that there have been lots of attempts

00:31:56.660 --> 00:32:01.140
<v David Flood>to amend the Constitution, but actually the Constitution is frozen.

00:32:01.990 --> 00:32:06.940
<v David Flood>I mean, it's not actually amendable anymore, at least not in the politics of any time recently.

00:32:07.740 --> 00:32:16.080
<v Michael Kennedy>yeah yeah it's so this is a database i cannot imagine a situation where the u.s constitution

00:32:16.400 --> 00:32:22.000
<v Michael Kennedy>gets admitted it has to be unanimous across all the states right is that right if i can't remember

00:32:22.160 --> 00:32:25.400
<v David Flood>but it's been a long time i remember off the top of my head it has to be unanimous but it certainly

00:32:25.580 --> 00:32:30.519
<v Michael Kennedy>has to be it's got to be lines yeah it's got to be pretty darn close if it's not it all

00:32:30.540 --> 00:32:36.480
<v Michael Kennedy>Alstair in. Yeah, it's like, you know, time travel, or the speed of your travels be light,

00:32:36.960 --> 00:32:39.200
<v Michael Kennedy>could be theoretically possible, probably not going to happen.

00:32:40.840 --> 00:32:44.640
<v David Flood>No, it's hard to see. It's hard to see. Yeah. So this is from a historian,

00:32:45.700 --> 00:32:51.560
<v David Flood>historian at Harvard. Interesting. Okay. So, so it's a database of all of and the full text

00:32:52.740 --> 00:33:00.180
<v David Flood>from all of these amendments. And, you know, it's, it's from the public's point of view,

00:33:00.480 --> 00:33:12.340
<v David Flood>It's a Postgres full text vector search interface for finding and filtering through on all of the different amendments that have been proposed.

00:33:13.980 --> 00:33:14.200
<v Michael Kennedy>Awesome.

00:33:14.480 --> 00:33:14.660
<v Michael Kennedy>Okay.

00:33:18.080 --> 00:33:18.640
<v Michael Kennedy>Let's see.

00:33:20.660 --> 00:33:21.220
<v Michael Kennedy>I love it.

00:33:23.600 --> 00:33:24.700
<v Michael Kennedy>Yeah, this is a nice looking site.

00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:27.240
<v David Flood>We work with a designer.

00:33:27.860 --> 00:33:28.280
<v David Flood>Okay.

00:33:29.060 --> 00:33:29.240
<v Michael Kennedy>Okay.

00:33:29.240 --> 00:33:29.320
<v Michael Kennedy>Yeah.

00:33:29.400 --> 00:33:31.800
<v Michael Kennedy>Yeah. Of course, like an agency would, right?

00:33:32.580 --> 00:33:33.040
<v David Flood>Yep. Yep.

00:33:36.840 --> 00:33:42.380
<v Michael Kennedy>Nice. So we'll get a really pretty rich search interface and then off you go.

00:33:42.660 --> 00:33:44.280
<v Michael Kennedy>I have no idea even what I would search for.

00:33:45.720 --> 00:33:47.460
<v David Flood>Yeah. Well, you can always search for something religious,

00:33:47.900 --> 00:33:50.600
<v David Flood>something abortion related. There's going to be lots of things there.

00:33:50.860 --> 00:33:53.520
<v Michael Kennedy>I thought all those also like guns, but like, I don't want to go down.

00:33:53.640 --> 00:33:56.020
<v Michael Kennedy>I'm not sure I even want to go down that route.

00:33:57.020 --> 00:33:58.320
<v Michael Kennedy>Awesome. This looks super useful.

00:33:59.440 --> 00:34:02.940
<v Michael Kennedy>Maybe someday we'll have a functional government again.

00:34:03.200 --> 00:34:03.460
<v Michael Kennedy>We'll see.

00:34:05.400 --> 00:34:06.120
<v Michael Kennedy>Let's change it.

00:34:06.520 --> 00:34:07.780
<v Michael Kennedy>Or maybe we'll go down in its folklore.

00:34:08.610 --> 00:34:09.300
<v Michael Kennedy>Like, look, it used to work.

00:34:09.300 --> 00:34:09.460
<v Michael Kennedy>All right.

00:34:10.190 --> 00:34:10.520
<v David Flood>So, yeah.

00:34:10.530 --> 00:34:21.440
<v David Flood>So another really great project, at least from a content point of view, that's interesting, the research that it's doing, is the Finn Folklore Database.

00:34:23.419 --> 00:34:39.940
<v David Flood>So in Celtic storytelling, you know, moms have been telling stories to daughters and people have been telling stories for a very long time, hundreds or a thousand years.

00:34:42.280 --> 00:34:49.540
<v David Flood>Finn McCommel who is a hero a hero from Irish mythology some of it some of it

00:34:49.700 --> 00:34:56.820
<v David Flood>based in you know historical events but it goes back it goes back so far so there

00:34:56.919 --> 00:35:03.020
<v David Flood>are there's many hundreds or thousands of of these stories that have been spread

00:35:03.160 --> 00:35:06.640
<v David Flood>and versions of these stories that have that have been told and so some of them

00:35:06.540 --> 00:35:12.220
<v David Flood>are audio recordings where somebody like some research researcher has has gone out to an island

00:35:12.250 --> 00:35:18.180
<v David Flood>off the coast of scotland and recorded somebody telling you know their version of the hero of finn

00:35:18.360 --> 00:35:25.000
<v David Flood>and his band of you know his band of heroes you know they defend scotland and ireland from from

00:35:25.480 --> 00:35:31.959
<v David Flood>invaders and attackers uh very exciting uh stories and stuff and a team of a team of characters

00:35:33.580 --> 00:35:37.440
<v David Flood>So there's audio recordings and then there's documents,

00:35:37.830 --> 00:35:39.920
<v David Flood>like written documents that contain these.

00:35:39.920 --> 00:35:44.280
<v David Flood>And so this is a database of kind of all of those all in one place with,

00:35:45.550 --> 00:35:51.980
<v David Flood>on the public side, a nice search interface for discovering them,

00:35:52.330 --> 00:35:54.700
<v David Flood>you know, either using the map view or searching.

00:35:55.340 --> 00:35:56.140
<v Michael Kennedy>Yeah, that's cool.

00:35:56.540 --> 00:35:59.320
<v Michael Kennedy>I got my map view for some random thing I searched about here.

00:36:00.380 --> 00:36:00.820
<v Michael Kennedy>Amazing.

00:36:02.980 --> 00:36:06.720
<v Michael Kennedy>Yeah, but this is pretty interesting, all these different tellings and stuff.

00:36:07.610 --> 00:36:14.020
<v David Flood>Oh, and yeah, one of the big challenges with this project is that it's fully internationalized.

00:36:14.330 --> 00:36:16.000
<v Michael Kennedy>So it's available in English.

00:36:16.220 --> 00:36:21.040
<v David Flood>Everything is available in English, Scottish Gaelic, and Irish Gaelic.

00:36:21.370 --> 00:36:22.960
<v David Flood>But that extends into the database.

00:36:23.330 --> 00:36:26.900
<v David Flood>So usually people have multiple names recorded for them.

00:36:28.180 --> 00:36:33.100
<v David Flood>And so, yeah, you may have one person with any number of names in different languages,

00:36:33.260 --> 00:36:36.260
<v David Flood>sometimes more than one Scottish name, that kind of thing.

00:36:36.280 --> 00:36:43.180
<v David Flood>And so the data model on this one is quite messy, but sensible.

00:36:44.400 --> 00:36:47.100
<v David Flood>But yeah, it's quite a lot of different kinds of data to wrangle.

00:36:47.320 --> 00:36:49.220
<v David Flood>And then with all of the translations for each thing.

00:36:49.960 --> 00:36:50.460
<v Michael Kennedy>Yeah, that's wild.

00:36:50.540 --> 00:36:56.520
<v Michael Kennedy>It's not just, we need the user interface of this thing to translate about.

00:36:57.920 --> 00:36:58.720
<v Michael Kennedy>That's way more, right?

00:36:59.420 --> 00:37:04.180
<v David Flood>Right. Yeah. Yeah. It is that. It is that. And then it is also, yes, all the items in the database

00:37:04.820 --> 00:37:06.380
<v David Flood>have a translation or can.

00:37:06.450 --> 00:37:11.940
<v Michael Kennedy>Okay. Yeah. I can see how that makes a lot of sense. You want to work in the native language

00:37:12.460 --> 00:37:15.180
<v Michael Kennedy>of the people who did that part of the folklore or whatever, right?

00:37:17.520 --> 00:37:21.280
<v David Flood>Yeah. Well, and people are still speaking those languages. So people who would use this

00:37:21.700 --> 00:37:25.499
<v David Flood>to, you know, like somebody may have heard a story from their mom or dad

00:37:25.680 --> 00:37:28.000
<v David Flood>and now would like to find other versions of that story.

00:37:28.430 --> 00:37:32.200
<v David Flood>And they live in a part of Scotland where they speak Scottish Gaelic as their first language.

00:37:32.760 --> 00:37:33.700
<v Michael Kennedy>Right, right. Very cool.

00:37:33.700 --> 00:37:34.540
<v David Flood>They can still access the site.

00:37:35.230 --> 00:37:39.960
<v Michael Kennedy>Yeah. And then that mapping color history one, that's another one of the public ones that you

00:37:40.740 --> 00:37:41.940
<v Michael Kennedy>said is pretty major.

00:37:43.620 --> 00:37:51.339
<v David Flood>Yeah, that's right. Yeah. So yeah, that's a pigments database. You can search by either

00:37:51.360 --> 00:37:57.520
<v David Flood>English color names like blue and find all of these Asian paintings that have blue or a particular kind

00:37:57.520 --> 00:38:05.440
<v Michael Kennedy>of pigment of how they made the blue. Yeah, nice. So what's the open source story? You're creating

00:38:05.440 --> 00:38:11.740
<v Michael Kennedy>all these apps, maybe some of these frameworks, there's got to be some tools. Is there a big

00:38:12.540 --> 00:38:19.579
<v Michael Kennedy>desire or already an effort to have a lot of these things open source or is it too niche or is it just

00:38:19.600 --> 00:38:26.560
<v Michael Kennedy>like this is the advantage of harvard has is other universities don't get this uh no it's it's

00:38:26.820 --> 00:38:32.720
<v David Flood>something we talk about quite a bit um usually these things start usually they start closed source

00:38:33.100 --> 00:38:38.460
<v David Flood>um during development and then we and then we work with the faculty and we talk about um

00:38:39.200 --> 00:38:45.099
<v David Flood>how we can take you know like the repo for the for the web app how we can take that um public

00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:48.640
<v David Flood>And so we've done that for a number of projects.

00:38:48.760 --> 00:38:49.620
<v David Flood>Not all of them are.

00:38:50.720 --> 00:38:54.420
<v David Flood>But the ideal is that they all make their way into the open,

00:38:55.440 --> 00:38:57.220
<v David Flood>and especially when they become archived.

00:38:58.580 --> 00:38:58.740
<v Michael Kennedy>Sure.

00:38:59.220 --> 00:39:01.500
<v Michael Kennedy>Yeah, that's a good way to help them live on.

00:39:02.320 --> 00:39:08.800
<v Michael Kennedy>And they might even go into GitHub's Arctic Vault, which is crazy.

00:39:08.840 --> 00:39:10.180
<v Michael Kennedy>I don't know if people know about that out there,

00:39:10.360 --> 00:39:17.240
<v Michael Kennedy>but GitHub has quite a while ago started taking copies of all of the repos and putting them,

00:39:18.200 --> 00:39:20.780
<v Michael Kennedy>backing them up and storing them in the Arctic vault.

00:39:21.700 --> 00:39:22.140
<v Michael Kennedy>It's kind of cool.

00:39:23.150 --> 00:39:26.280
<v Michael Kennedy>I really, really, really hope we never need that, but it's kind of neat.

00:39:26.920 --> 00:39:27.380
<v David Flood>Yeah, me too.

00:39:28.380 --> 00:39:31.140
<v David Flood>Usually universities have their own archival system,

00:39:31.440 --> 00:39:38.680
<v David Flood>so any important research data is usually part of that system as well.

00:39:39.080 --> 00:39:39.460
<v Michael Kennedy>I see.

00:39:39.590 --> 00:39:39.700
<v Michael Kennedy>Okay.

00:39:39.930 --> 00:39:40.060
<v Michael Kennedy>Yeah.

00:39:40.840 --> 00:39:48.960
<v Michael Kennedy>obviously right like i'm i can't remember where it was it was somewhere i think it was south korea

00:39:49.040 --> 00:39:55.180
<v Michael Kennedy>or taiwan where like seven years of government data got lost or something like that it was really

00:39:55.340 --> 00:39:59.280
<v Michael Kennedy>really bad recently there was a fire and i think they had backups but maybe just into the building

00:39:59.750 --> 00:40:02.979
<v Michael Kennedy>you know like we'll put that out we'll back it up to the hard drive over here

00:40:05.920 --> 00:40:06.280
<v Michael Kennedy>Not good.

00:40:06.880 --> 00:40:07.280
<v Michael Kennedy>No.

00:40:09.180 --> 00:40:09.620
<v Michael Kennedy>Not good.

00:40:09.640 --> 00:40:11.060
<v Michael Kennedy>You definitely want this stuff to survive.

00:40:11.060 --> 00:40:14.460
<v Michael Kennedy>I mean, academia has this history of, like,

00:40:15.520 --> 00:40:17.040
<v Michael Kennedy>tomes that have survived the past

00:40:17.680 --> 00:40:21.500
<v Michael Kennedy>and really, really long-lived information, right?

00:40:23.400 --> 00:40:26.160
<v Michael Kennedy>Besides the Library of Alexandria or something like that, maybe.

00:40:26.680 --> 00:40:27.460
<v David Flood>That's what we want.

00:40:27.700 --> 00:40:28.160
<v David Flood>That's what we want.

00:40:28.220 --> 00:40:30.400
<v David Flood>We want it to, yeah, we want it to last.

00:40:32.020 --> 00:40:32.300
<v Michael Kennedy>Absolutely.

00:40:32.680 --> 00:40:37.820
<v Michael Kennedy>So maybe that's a good time to sort of talk about the trailing end.

00:40:37.820 --> 00:40:40.300
<v Michael Kennedy>I think there's a lot of interesting things going on here.

00:40:43.180 --> 00:40:49.840
<v Michael Kennedy>Just like you've run out of money, not because you actually run out of money.

00:40:50.380 --> 00:40:53.620
<v Michael Kennedy>The grant is done, and you've either spent or given back or whatever

00:40:53.810 --> 00:40:55.580
<v Michael Kennedy>with the remaining little bits of money.

00:40:56.800 --> 00:40:58.260
<v Michael Kennedy>It's always a weird balance with research.

00:40:58.620 --> 00:41:01.800
<v Michael Kennedy>It's like, oh, we got $3,000 left on this research grant.

00:41:01.900 --> 00:41:02.780
<v Michael Kennedy>What are we going to do with it?

00:41:02.840 --> 00:41:03.900
<v Michael Kennedy>It's not like, well, we're going to give it back.

00:41:04.040 --> 00:41:04.720
<v Michael Kennedy>We just didn't need it.

00:41:04.960 --> 00:41:09.380
<v Michael Kennedy>It's like, we're going to find a way to like fund a student to do a little more work or

00:41:09.460 --> 00:41:09.540
<v Michael Kennedy>whatever.

00:41:09.760 --> 00:41:11.880
<v Michael Kennedy>But eventually the grant is over.

00:41:14.440 --> 00:41:18.380
<v Michael Kennedy>Then you've got some expensive app access to a big database because it needs a big search

00:41:18.640 --> 00:41:20.740
<v Michael Kennedy>or a lot of compute or something.

00:41:21.760 --> 00:41:22.040
<v David Flood>That's right.

00:41:22.460 --> 00:41:27.720
<v David Flood>Everything during like, I mean, anything, anything that's a, that's a Django app.

00:41:28.520 --> 00:41:38.600
<v David Flood>We deploy to AWS using containers, which isn't the cheapest way to host anything.

00:41:40.699 --> 00:41:43.700
<v David Flood>But that's for the most part the Harvard way.

00:41:45.680 --> 00:41:47.780
<v David Flood>And it is robust and is reliable.

00:41:48.540 --> 00:41:58.460
<v David Flood>And we don't have a DevOps person on call on the weekend to rescue one of these people.

00:41:58.480 --> 00:42:04.780
<v David Flood>apps so having having them reliable is good okay so it's so it's on AWS and

00:42:05.120 --> 00:42:09.320
<v David Flood>paying you know paying for the containers paying for that elastic search cluster

00:42:09.800 --> 00:42:16.640
<v David Flood>the art RDS Postgres database okay well even if somebody wants to start paying

00:42:16.740 --> 00:42:19.740
<v David Flood>for that out-of-pocket all of those little services they add up they add up

00:42:19.780 --> 00:42:26.359
<v David Flood>to enough that we need to do something when the project hits end of life and so

00:42:26.420 --> 00:42:53.720
<v David Flood>So our gold standard that we've developed so far is asking, can this become a static website? Can we bake this out into all HTML files and acknowledge that there will be some trade-offs? We will trade off some searching. It's not going to have Elasticsearch. It doesn't mean that it won't have any search, though. So we'll trade out Elasticsearch, and it'll be very difficult to add new data.

00:42:54.360 --> 00:43:20.360
<v David Flood>But that's okay because it's being archived. So can we get it into a static site? And that's challenging depending on how you've set it up. So we now have projects where we set them up from the beginning to be archivable like this. And one of them is called Water Stories. And it was a companion to an art installation at the Radcliffe Institute on the Harvard campus.

00:43:21.440 --> 00:43:30.420
<v David Flood>And so this was this live site during the duration of the art installation where people could come in and add stories that they had about water onto an iPad.

00:43:31.960 --> 00:43:33.200
<v David Flood>And then those went up to our database.

00:43:35.500 --> 00:43:43.980
<v David Flood>We built that with something called Django Bakery, which if you opt in and you use all of their class-based views the way that they're meant to be used,

00:43:45.680 --> 00:43:48.520
<v David Flood>then you can bake this out into static files when you're done.

00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:49.700
<v David Flood>Very low effort.

00:43:50.310 --> 00:43:50.880
<v David Flood>That was perfect.

00:43:51.320 --> 00:44:15.740
<v Michael Kennedy>That is such a cool idea. And mad props to them for ASCII art logos. Come on now. I feel like that should be in the view source if it's not. But this is such a cool idea because you can just take a working site. You guys are at Django Shop, so a lot of your sites are written in Django and you just go, make it static, right? More or less?

00:44:15.800 --> 00:44:20.900
<v David Flood>Yes. And what's really great about it is if they wanted to make a change, and they have,

00:44:21.040 --> 00:44:24.620
<v David Flood>they have asked since we, since we made it static, they've asked for a couple of changes.

00:44:25.300 --> 00:44:31.220
<v David Flood>So locally, I just Docker compose up this whole application, make the change in the Django admin

00:44:31.840 --> 00:44:32.740
<v David Flood>and rebake the site.

00:44:34.020 --> 00:44:34.620
<v Michael Kennedy>Yeah, that's cool.

00:44:34.980 --> 00:44:35.820
<v Michael Kennedy>It can still be updated.

00:44:36.540 --> 00:44:40.660
<v Michael Kennedy>Something, if you've never tried this, like something like, hey, can we just add one more

00:44:40.840 --> 00:44:44.720
<v Michael Kennedy>menu item? And you're like, no, no, no, we're not adding the menu item because you know what that

00:44:44.700 --> 00:44:51.180
<v Michael Kennedy>That means we're changing 7,300 pages because they all bake in the whole HTML, right?

00:44:51.680 --> 00:44:52.060
<v David Flood>Exactly.

00:44:52.530 --> 00:44:53.140
<v David Flood>Yeah, exactly.

00:44:53.230 --> 00:44:58.060
<v David Flood>But if that's in my Django database, in my SQLite file, then no problem at all.

00:44:58.570 --> 00:44:59.840
<v Michael Kennedy>Because then I just rebake it.

00:45:00.270 --> 00:45:00.440
<v David Flood>Yeah.

00:45:00.780 --> 00:45:02.240
<v Michael Kennedy>Yeah, absolutely.

00:45:03.960 --> 00:45:07.480
<v Michael Kennedy>So I think this is super neat.

00:45:07.540 --> 00:45:14.720
<v Michael Kennedy>There's also Frozen Flask, if I could get rid of all the ads.

00:45:14.750 --> 00:45:16.540
<v Michael Kennedy>I do not need a Yeti thing, whatever that is.

00:45:17.700 --> 00:45:20.320
<v Michael Kennedy>The glass, not the mythical thing.

00:45:21.260 --> 00:45:27.680
<v Michael Kennedy>But Frozen Flask, which does a similar thing for Flask apps,

00:45:27.840 --> 00:45:30.740
<v Michael Kennedy>if you're a Flask person, probably would work with Quart.

00:45:31.040 --> 00:45:32.460
<v Michael Kennedy>Don't know for sure, but probably.

00:45:33.600 --> 00:45:35.720
<v Michael Kennedy>So that's a pretty interesting idea as well.

00:45:36.490 --> 00:45:37.060
<v Michael Kennedy>Throw that in there.

00:45:38.200 --> 00:45:42.140
<v Michael Kennedy>But also, what else?

00:45:42.900 --> 00:45:46.420
<v Michael Kennedy>Also, you talked about search, right?

00:45:46.660 --> 00:45:49.920
<v Michael Kennedy>That can be such a problem.

00:45:50.560 --> 00:45:56.040
<v Michael Kennedy>And I'm a huge fan of your recommendation here with PageFind.

00:45:58.620 --> 00:45:59.760
<v Michael Kennedy>Tell us about PageFind.

00:46:00.140 --> 00:46:04.299
<v David Flood>So this has been, I think it's been a bit of a game changer in how

00:46:04.320 --> 00:46:10.640
<v David Flood>functional one of these archived sites can remain. So we're actually in the process of that amendments

00:46:11.200 --> 00:46:18.640
<v David Flood>website that searches across 22,000 full texts of amendments. We are in the process of sunsetting

00:46:18.800 --> 00:46:24.620
<v David Flood>that and that will become a static site. And that's for that search. We already have an internal demo

00:46:24.840 --> 00:46:33.020
<v David Flood>that that proves that we can replace that Postgres full search with PageFind. You lose vector search.

00:46:33.980 --> 00:46:38.200
<v Michael Kennedy>Yeah. You kind of got to get really true keyword matching.

00:46:39.670 --> 00:46:44.820
<v David Flood>Yeah. Yeah, that's right. But you still get filtering. I mean, and really faceting and filtering

00:46:45.520 --> 00:46:52.460
<v David Flood>is when it comes to discovery of things, I mean, I find that's really what's useful. So filtering

00:46:52.800 --> 00:46:59.500
<v David Flood>these amendments by state or by the Congress that was active at the time or by the person who

00:47:02.280 --> 00:47:09.660
<v David Flood>who co-wrote it um all of those are totally great in page find and the uh the keyword search is just

00:47:09.780 --> 00:47:14.240
<v David Flood>fine in page find uh one of the things i really like about it is that it it takes your index

00:47:15.300 --> 00:47:20.520
<v David Flood>and it chops it up into lots of little files that can just fly across the network so it's a very fast

00:47:20.740 --> 00:47:28.140
<v David Flood>search um it's it's not a huge network load even if your index is initially very large and it

00:47:28.160 --> 00:47:30.580
<v David Flood>It essentially cuts it up somewhat alphabetically.

00:47:31.110 --> 00:47:36.800
<v David Flood>So if your search starts with T, or I should say a better word for audio,

00:47:36.920 --> 00:47:43.400
<v David Flood>if it starts with W, then it will load up the index for words that start with W

00:47:43.970 --> 00:47:46.180
<v David Flood>and fly that over the network instead of the whole thing.

00:47:46.270 --> 00:47:49.400
<v David Flood>So it's pretty slick, and it has a great Python API.

00:47:50.280 --> 00:47:53.960
<v David Flood>So to do the proof of concept for the amendments search,

00:47:54.200 --> 00:48:00.860
<v David Flood>I just took a database dump and then manually indexed with a Python script into PageFind.

00:48:01.060 --> 00:48:03.880
<v Michael Kennedy>Wait, there's a Python API for PageFind?

00:48:04.820 --> 00:48:04.900
<v David Flood>Yeah.

00:48:05.080 --> 00:48:13.100
<v David Flood>So the way PageFind works, I should have said that, is the way most people will use it is by normally PageFind consumes HTML.

00:48:13.780 --> 00:48:16.880
<v David Flood>So you give it access to your dist folder.

00:48:18.280 --> 00:48:18.880
<v Michael Kennedy>Oh, okay.

00:48:20.040 --> 00:48:22.700
<v David Flood>And then it crawls through all of your HTML files.

00:48:22.840 --> 00:48:31.800
<v David Flood>And you can do great things like adding little HTML tags that are just for PageFind that give it the filtering ability or that you want to sort by something.

00:48:32.260 --> 00:48:33.300
<v David Flood>And so that's great.

00:48:34.100 --> 00:48:41.600
<v David Flood>Or you can just call PageFind from Python or from TypeScript and just build that index manually.

00:48:42.400 --> 00:48:43.200
<v Michael Kennedy>Well, thanks a lot, David.

00:48:43.320 --> 00:48:44.680
<v Michael Kennedy>I have another thing I've got to go research.

00:48:44.900 --> 00:48:45.380
<v Michael Kennedy>This is awesome.

00:48:46.300 --> 00:48:48.060
<v Michael Kennedy>I'm a huge fan of PageFind, as I said.

00:48:48.080 --> 00:48:53.540
<v Michael Kennedy>on my personal website, mkennedy.codes, is just a pure stat.

00:48:53.570 --> 00:48:56.020
<v Michael Kennedy>It starts in Markdown and ends up in HTML.

00:48:56.440 --> 00:48:59.100
<v Michael Kennedy>But if you add page find in, you get a super rich,

00:48:59.320 --> 00:49:00.740
<v Michael Kennedy>if you want to just know, you want to talk about,

00:49:00.860 --> 00:49:06.480
<v Michael Kennedy>like what was about Docker, it shows you really nice results,

00:49:07.500 --> 00:49:10.620
<v Michael Kennedy>pulling out the different parts of the page and sections that talk about it,

00:49:10.720 --> 00:49:12.720
<v Michael Kennedy>like the headers and then what is said.

00:49:12.760 --> 00:49:17.400
<v Michael Kennedy>and it even does like sub word, you know,

00:49:17.520 --> 00:49:20.300
<v Michael Kennedy>like if you just type doc, it finds all the words that match that.

00:49:20.560 --> 00:49:23.520
<v Michael Kennedy>And what I really like about it is a couple of things is it's instant.

00:49:23.800 --> 00:49:26.580
<v Michael Kennedy>It basically is like nearly instant.

00:49:26.760 --> 00:49:29.800
<v Michael Kennedy>If you type a few things, it gets way faster because it's pulling down.

00:49:29.910 --> 00:49:33.560
<v Michael Kennedy>And if you go and look in the network console here

00:49:33.740 --> 00:49:35.000
<v Michael Kennedy>and you type something,

00:49:35.210 --> 00:49:39.520
<v Michael Kennedy>you can see that it's actually pulling in these little tiny fragments,

00:49:40.440 --> 00:49:43.120
<v Michael Kennedy>which this one's coming off disk cache in three milliseconds, right?

00:49:43.240 --> 00:49:48.940
<v Michael Kennedy>But it breaks your index into a bunch of very small page find fragments

00:49:50.600 --> 00:49:54.000
<v Michael Kennedy>that I think it starts with anything that starts with the word DO.

00:49:54.260 --> 00:49:56.680
<v Michael Kennedy>These are all the prebuilt results and stuff like that, right?

00:49:57.420 --> 00:49:58.360
<v David Flood>That's right. That's right.

00:49:58.840 --> 00:49:59.820
<v Michael Kennedy>Yeah, that's super cool.

00:50:00.620 --> 00:50:00.700
<v David Flood>Yeah.

00:50:01.320 --> 00:50:09.740
<v David Flood>One of our open source projects that we maintain is a Vue.js component library for page find.

00:50:10.120 --> 00:50:13.780
<v David Flood>so that we can style it and reuse it across different projects.

00:50:15.500 --> 00:50:16.460
<v Michael Kennedy>Oh, that's awesome.

00:50:16.850 --> 00:50:17.280
<v Michael Kennedy>I love it.

00:50:18.300 --> 00:50:19.760
<v Michael Kennedy>Yeah, I think this really unlocks it.

00:50:19.760 --> 00:50:24.980
<v Michael Kennedy>And when you go to so many sites, like their documentation

00:50:25.620 --> 00:50:28.760
<v Michael Kennedy>or just their web app, and the search is so bad.

00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:32.500
<v Michael Kennedy>You type something, and it's like thinking, spinning, spinning,

00:50:33.020 --> 00:50:34.040
<v Michael Kennedy>spinning, spinning.

00:50:34.420 --> 00:50:37.800
<v Michael Kennedy>And then five seconds later, it gives you kind of janky results.

00:50:38.240 --> 00:50:39.960
<v Michael Kennedy>And if you just throw a page find in there,

00:50:41.740 --> 00:50:44.520
<v Michael Kennedy>you can't type fast enough to outrun the results.

00:50:44.540 --> 00:50:44.980
<v Michael Kennedy>You know what I mean?

00:50:45.280 --> 00:50:45.860
<v David Flood>No, that's right.

00:50:45.860 --> 00:50:46.000
<v David Flood>Yeah.

00:50:46.900 --> 00:50:48.880
<v David Flood>Too many static site search solutions,

00:50:49.040 --> 00:50:53.060
<v David Flood>they use like a JSON blob that you have to pull down

00:50:53.700 --> 00:50:54.520
<v David Flood>and then iterate through.

00:50:55.100 --> 00:50:57.060
<v Michael Kennedy>You know what's worse, and I see this a lot,

00:50:57.200 --> 00:51:03.780
<v Michael Kennedy>would be if you go to google.com, and then you would say,

00:51:04.400 --> 00:51:05.780
<v Michael Kennedy>effectively, site, colon, whatever,

00:51:05.960 --> 00:51:06.880
<v Michael Kennedy>and then you search Docker.

00:51:07.780 --> 00:51:10.040
<v Michael Kennedy>They basically pull that.

00:51:11.080 --> 00:51:13.040
<v Michael Kennedy>They just say, search this, and you just

00:51:13.180 --> 00:51:15.840
<v Michael Kennedy>get Google results for your site.

00:51:15.930 --> 00:51:18.840
<v Michael Kennedy>And obviously, Google's fine, but it's just--

00:51:18.840 --> 00:51:20.580
<v David Flood>No, I find that unusable, really.

00:51:20.720 --> 00:51:21.100
<v Michael Kennedy>I do, too.

00:51:21.210 --> 00:51:22.720
<v Michael Kennedy>It really-- you're like, ah, jeez.

00:51:23.500 --> 00:51:25.500
<v Michael Kennedy>But now I'm super excited to realize

00:51:25.650 --> 00:51:28.500
<v Michael Kennedy>I can do that from my dynamic content as well.

00:51:29.740 --> 00:51:31.580
<v Michael Kennedy>So with the Python integration.

00:51:32.070 --> 00:51:32.180
<v Michael Kennedy>OK.

00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:34.100
<v Michael Kennedy>Nice.

00:51:36.880 --> 00:51:38.660
<v Michael Kennedy>What about something truly static?

00:51:38.780 --> 00:51:41.620
<v Michael Kennedy>Have you looked at Hugo and some of the other type of things?

00:51:42.100 --> 00:51:42.340
<v David Flood>Sure.

00:51:42.570 --> 00:51:47.220
<v David Flood>So when I see you've even got the tab up for the SUMEB project,

00:51:47.560 --> 00:51:49.040
<v David Flood>which is--

00:51:50.260 --> 00:51:57.400
<v David Flood>that's essentially a database of many, many specimens taken

00:51:57.620 --> 00:51:58.540
<v David Flood>from the SUMEB mine.

00:52:00.140 --> 00:52:00.580
<v Michael Kennedy>OK.

00:52:01.440 --> 00:52:02.080
<v David Flood>Looks beautiful.

00:52:02.920 --> 00:52:03.540
<v David Flood>Oh, it is.

00:52:03.550 --> 00:52:03.660
<v David Flood>Yeah.

00:52:03.770 --> 00:52:04.240
<v David Flood>Yeah, it is.

00:52:04.700 --> 00:52:06.240
<v David Flood>So if you click on Minerals database,

00:52:06.740 --> 00:52:07.920
<v David Flood>you open up that search interface

00:52:08.100 --> 00:52:10.700
<v David Flood>and that's powered by PageFind.

00:52:10.880 --> 00:52:11.840
<v Michael Kennedy>- Oh, this is?

00:52:12.320 --> 00:52:12.620
<v David Flood>- Yes.

00:52:16.160 --> 00:52:18.260
<v David Flood>I forget what I was...

00:52:19.220 --> 00:52:19.560
<v Michael Kennedy>- I see.

00:52:19.940 --> 00:52:21.620
<v Michael Kennedy>You've even like hooked into,

00:52:21.980 --> 00:52:25.240
<v Michael Kennedy>I was thinking just like pure static, like Hugo, like...

00:52:25.800 --> 00:52:27.200
<v David Flood>- Oh yes, yes, yes.

00:52:27.460 --> 00:52:28.620
<v David Flood>So this is an astro site.

00:52:29.420 --> 00:52:32.680
<v David Flood>So for this website, we have this as an astro site

00:52:32.700 --> 00:52:34.080
<v David Flood>so that we have a little bit,

00:52:34.260 --> 00:52:37.960
<v David Flood>Because with Astro, they make it so easy to pull in Vue components.

00:52:38.720 --> 00:52:39.280
<v Michael Kennedy>I see.

00:52:39.420 --> 00:52:44.180
<v David Flood>So our page find is a custom Vue.js component library.

00:52:44.920 --> 00:52:46.900
<v David Flood>With Astro, you can use React components.

00:52:47.000 --> 00:52:48.620
<v David Flood>You can use Vue components.

00:52:48.820 --> 00:52:51.640
<v David Flood>But what it does is it's just a static site generator.

00:52:51.740 --> 00:52:51.880
<v Michael Kennedy>Yeah.

00:52:52.460 --> 00:52:52.560
<v Michael Kennedy>Yeah.

00:52:53.780 --> 00:52:54.180
<v Michael Kennedy>Fantastic.

00:52:54.820 --> 00:52:58.780
<v Michael Kennedy>So a little bit more designable than Hugo or something.

00:52:59.040 --> 00:52:59.800
<v Michael Kennedy>Here's your markdown file.

00:52:59.880 --> 00:53:00.420
<v Michael Kennedy>Good luck with that.

00:53:00.480 --> 00:53:01.320
<v David Flood>Yeah, I love Hugo, though.

00:53:01.560 --> 00:53:05.240
<v David Flood>Yeah, I use Hugo for different personal sites here and there.

00:53:05.560 --> 00:53:07.780
<v David Flood>And it's just so fast and easy to get up and running.

00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:08.940
<v Michael Kennedy>But it's great.

00:53:08.940 --> 00:53:09.140
<v Michael Kennedy>I do too.

00:53:09.620 --> 00:53:11.320
<v Michael Kennedy>That's what my website's written in, is in Hugo.

00:53:13.540 --> 00:53:15.660
<v Michael Kennedy>But if I'm integrating with anything else,

00:53:15.780 --> 00:53:17.120
<v Michael Kennedy>I used to kind of split it up.

00:53:17.160 --> 00:53:19.300
<v Michael Kennedy>Like this part's Hugo and this part's a Python app.

00:53:20.300 --> 00:53:22.300
<v Michael Kennedy>And it's pretty easy to get something

00:53:22.440 --> 00:53:23.920
<v Michael Kennedy>that will take a bunch of Markdown files

00:53:24.060 --> 00:53:27.160
<v Michael Kennedy>and just turn them into HTML and just put a page template

00:53:27.300 --> 00:53:27.720
<v Michael Kennedy>around that.

00:53:27.900 --> 00:53:31.740
<v Michael Kennedy>So I've kind of stepped away from mixing and matching that

00:53:31.840 --> 00:53:32.700
<v Michael Kennedy>as much as I used to.

00:53:32.940 --> 00:53:35.960
<v Michael Kennedy>So now if I've got a static section of a dynamic site.

00:53:36.340 --> 00:53:40.500
<v Michael Kennedy>But that has nothing to do with the archival side of things,

00:53:40.700 --> 00:53:40.860
<v Michael Kennedy>right?

00:53:41.480 --> 00:53:43.780
<v Michael Kennedy>Because the idea is that the thing that I'm describing

00:53:43.980 --> 00:53:44.900
<v Michael Kennedy>is gone on purpose.

00:53:45.220 --> 00:53:45.620
<v David Flood>That's right.

00:53:47.800 --> 00:53:48.280
<v Michael Kennedy>OK.

00:53:51.560 --> 00:53:53.100
<v Michael Kennedy>So you've got some--

00:53:54.540 --> 00:53:55.760
<v Michael Kennedy>we've got Django Bakery.

00:53:56.340 --> 00:54:02.780
<v Michael Kennedy>I threw out Frozen Flask, and I'm sure there's a ton more that neither of us are aware of at the moment.

00:54:03.260 --> 00:54:10.800
<v David Flood>So Django Bakery was really good for that purpose, and we're keeping our eyes open for projects that it's a good fit for.

00:54:11.730 --> 00:54:13.740
<v David Flood>But that was a pretty simple website.

00:54:13.950 --> 00:54:16.580
<v David Flood>It needed a dynamic backend, but it was quite straightforward.

00:54:17.420 --> 00:54:22.080
<v David Flood>And for Django Bakery, you have to opt into inheriting from their class-based views.

00:54:22.190 --> 00:54:22.440
<v David Flood>I see.

00:54:23.060 --> 00:54:25.120
<v David Flood>So you've got to think ahead of it.

00:54:25.920 --> 00:54:27.260
<v David Flood>Yeah, absolutely.

00:54:27.920 --> 00:54:30.080
<v David Flood>Hard to add retroactively, probably impossible.

00:54:31.680 --> 00:54:34.500
<v David Flood>Now our other websites, like the fin example

00:54:34.740 --> 00:54:40.080
<v David Flood>and the mapping color example, those are APIs.

00:54:40.640 --> 00:54:42.940
<v David Flood>That's a Django API, Django REST framework for one,

00:54:43.960 --> 00:54:45.360
<v David Flood>GraphQL for the other.

00:54:46.160 --> 00:54:48.460
<v David Flood>One has a view front end, one has a React front end.

00:54:48.940 --> 00:54:52.480
<v David Flood>Okay, well Django Bankery just isn't gonna work very well

00:54:52.700 --> 00:54:54.080
<v David Flood>for like serializing JSON.

00:54:54.700 --> 00:54:57.980
<v Michael Kennedy>It's like, awesome, here's your unrendered JavaScript

00:54:58.220 --> 00:55:00.220
<v Michael Kennedy>front-end code and it's just gonna look empty or something.

00:55:01.340 --> 00:55:04.360
<v David Flood>- Yeah, so it is a good reason to consider using

00:55:05.230 --> 00:55:07.140
<v David Flood>like vanilla Django templates when possible,

00:55:08.110 --> 00:55:11.300
<v David Flood>like for that reason, but those were inherited

00:55:12.700 --> 00:55:15.580
<v David Flood>from the vendors, those two sites,

00:55:15.610 --> 00:55:17.080
<v David Flood>and we've made a lot of progress on those.

00:55:17.700 --> 00:55:21.020
<v David Flood>So, you know, what to do in that,

00:55:21.580 --> 00:55:24.380
<v David Flood>Like in that situation, Django Bakery isn't an option.

00:55:26.130 --> 00:55:28.120
<v David Flood>And those projects are not end of life yet.

00:55:28.310 --> 00:55:32.080
<v David Flood>So we have some time, but we're, so what we're doing is strategizing.

00:55:32.280 --> 00:55:33.740
<v David Flood>Okay, how will we rescue them?

00:55:33.790 --> 00:55:39.160
<v David Flood>How will we keep them alive once somebody needs to stop paying for hosting?

00:55:40.220 --> 00:55:41.600
<v David Flood>And we have ideas.

00:55:41.990 --> 00:55:45.160
<v David Flood>We have, I think there's clever, interesting things out there.

00:55:46.160 --> 00:55:47.400
<v David Flood>We'll have to keep looking into it.

00:55:51.320 --> 00:55:55.760
<v Michael Kennedy>There are some pretty interesting ideas and I know that you had been thinking about them.

00:55:56.640 --> 00:55:59.720
<v Michael Kennedy>What if instead of having a back-end that ran in a container,

00:56:00.440 --> 00:56:03.440
<v Michael Kennedy>you could just have WebAssembly,

00:56:04.070 --> 00:56:05.520
<v Michael Kennedy>but still have it go,

00:56:05.730 --> 00:56:07.460
<v Michael Kennedy>just a local loopback type of thing?

00:56:08.000 --> 00:56:14.159
<v David Flood>Yeah, I'm really interested in this one because it enables essentially

00:56:14.180 --> 00:56:21.260
<v David Flood>the full functionality of the live site to exist as what is just a static site.

00:56:22.440 --> 00:56:30.300
<v David Flood>So because of Pyodide and projects like PyScript, we can run Python in the browser.

00:56:31.760 --> 00:56:33.620
<v David Flood>And we can run SQLite in the browser.

00:56:34.240 --> 00:56:37.960
<v David Flood>And now we can even run Postgres in the browser with PG Lite.

00:56:39.540 --> 00:56:44.280
<v David Flood>So we can run all those things in the browser, then couldn't we run, couldn't we have Django

00:56:44.900 --> 00:56:46.620
<v David Flood>hosted right in the browser?

00:56:47.500 --> 00:56:47.880
<v Michael Kennedy>And you can.

00:56:48.730 --> 00:56:49.300
<v David Flood>You can.

00:56:49.310 --> 00:56:54.860
<v David Flood>So there's a proof of concept that proves it's possible called Django WebAssembly.

00:56:56.660 --> 00:57:02.860
<v David Flood>And if you load up this, if you load this up, it'll let you log in to the Django admin

00:57:03.100 --> 00:57:04.900
<v David Flood>and you're not logging into anybody's backend.

00:57:05.240 --> 00:57:11.120
<v David Flood>logging into your own browser where this is running in a service worker.

00:57:11.960 --> 00:57:12.400
<v Michael Kennedy>Awesome.

00:57:12.980 --> 00:57:13.380
<v Michael Kennedy>Look at that.

00:57:14.200 --> 00:57:14.700
<v Michael Kennedy>Oh, hold on.

00:57:14.760 --> 00:57:15.640
<v Michael Kennedy>I told you where the password was.

00:57:17.280 --> 00:57:17.820
<v Michael Kennedy>Very secure.

00:57:18.420 --> 00:57:18.800
<v Michael Kennedy>Matt?

00:57:19.960 --> 00:57:20.400
<v Michael Kennedy>Password.

00:57:20.500 --> 00:57:25.600
<v David Flood>Well, it can be entirely insecure because, yeah, it's running right in your own browser.

00:57:25.920 --> 00:57:26.500
<v Michael Kennedy>Yeah, that's awesome.

00:57:26.570 --> 00:57:27.980
<v Michael Kennedy>And here we are, Django admin.

00:57:28.520 --> 00:57:28.940
<v Michael Kennedy>Incredible.

00:57:30.220 --> 00:57:31.360
<v Michael Kennedy>Yeah, so I'm pretty interested in this.

00:57:32.140 --> 00:57:38.160
<v David Flood>You've got to convert an RDS Postgres database into either SQLite or something like PGLite.

00:57:38.440 --> 00:57:39.400
<v David Flood>But I think that's all doable.

00:57:39.820 --> 00:57:41.800
<v David Flood>So I think it's an exciting possibility.

00:57:42.160 --> 00:57:42.760
<v Michael Kennedy>Yeah, for sure.

00:57:42.820 --> 00:57:49.680
<v Michael Kennedy>I do think, so maybe you have a rich query system that you're powering by your database

00:57:50.020 --> 00:57:50.580
<v Michael Kennedy>that's really heavy.

00:57:51.560 --> 00:57:51.940
<v David Flood>Exactly.

00:57:52.240 --> 00:57:56.420
<v Michael Kennedy>And it's got a bunch of data that's like, here's all of our working data that you might ask

00:57:56.580 --> 00:57:57.080
<v Michael Kennedy>questions about.

00:57:57.760 --> 00:58:01.240
<v Michael Kennedy>Maybe you just convert that to PageFind to help you find the pieces.

00:58:01.360 --> 00:58:03.200
<v Michael Kennedy>and just keep the operational data

00:58:03.330 --> 00:58:06.000
<v Michael Kennedy>and maybe like even a SQLite with like the Django ORM,

00:58:06.000 --> 00:58:09.000
<v Michael Kennedy>you can just switch the connection, keep talking to it.

00:58:09.110 --> 00:58:12.780
<v Michael Kennedy>I mean, there's possibilities to just get something not too terrible

00:58:12.920 --> 00:58:14.560
<v Michael Kennedy>that's not the same, but not that far off.

00:58:15.560 --> 00:58:15.960
<v David Flood>Yeah, exactly.

00:58:16.680 --> 00:58:19.900
<v David Flood>And then it goes on GitHub pages and it can live hopefully forever.

00:58:20.050 --> 00:58:22.520
<v David Flood>I mean, it feels like GitHub will last forever,

00:58:23.160 --> 00:58:25.020
<v David Flood>but it'll last longer than funding will anyways.

00:58:26.400 --> 00:58:34.920
<v Michael Kennedy>It's definitely going to last longer than just something that we can't pay for anymore.

00:58:36.320 --> 00:58:41.900
<v Michael Kennedy>I don't know how long GitHub is going to be around for, I think a while, but you never know.

00:58:42.430 --> 00:58:43.740
<v Michael Kennedy>It seems like stuff is going to last forever.

00:58:43.830 --> 00:58:46.920
<v Michael Kennedy>Then it gets changed.

00:58:47.050 --> 00:58:47.740
<v Michael Kennedy>We had subversion.

00:58:49.380 --> 00:58:50.880
<v Michael Kennedy>Now it's completely gone, right?

00:58:51.430 --> 00:58:53.100
<v Michael Kennedy>Just 20 years, 15 years later.

00:58:53.320 --> 00:58:55.440
<v Michael Kennedy>But still, I think 100% there.

00:58:56.340 --> 00:58:59.120
<v David Flood>- Yeah, but if something ever happened,

00:58:59.540 --> 00:59:02.360
<v David Flood>somebody just needs to copy that folder of HTML,

00:59:03.200 --> 00:59:06.740
<v David Flood>CSS and JavaScript files and dump it into an S3 bucket

00:59:07.400 --> 00:59:10.140
<v David Flood>or somewhere else and then it can continue living there.

00:59:10.840 --> 00:59:11.900
<v David Flood>So it's a good option.

00:59:12.640 --> 00:59:13.420
<v Michael Kennedy>- It's a great option.

00:59:13.740 --> 00:59:14.820
<v Michael Kennedy>It's a really, really good option.

00:59:14.950 --> 00:59:21.040
<v Michael Kennedy>I mean, I guess one of the long-term concerns might be

00:59:22.100 --> 00:59:25.440
<v Michael Kennedy>what if the WebAssembly standard changes so much

00:59:25.460 --> 00:59:32.020
<v Michael Kennedy>it's not supported anymore but you could probably bite wise convert it if you had to you know like

00:59:32.140 --> 00:59:37.300
<v David Flood>somebody would probably be able to create one yeah that would that would be unfortunate so

00:59:37.720 --> 00:59:43.820
<v David Flood>i suppose if that happens i mean if that happens yeah we're um booting up one of these projects

00:59:44.360 --> 00:59:50.680
<v David Flood>projects is like booting up an emulator for some old dos game right right well i mean i guess

00:59:51.940 --> 00:59:59.180
<v Michael Kennedy>let's think about this for a second somebody got oh gosh what was the chain this is the whole um

01:00:02.360 --> 01:00:09.820
<v Michael Kennedy>yavascript the pycon talk where got like firefox compiled into

01:00:11.060 --> 01:00:18.960
<v Michael Kennedy>wet not wasm into asm js or something like that so it was run like chrome was running firefox

01:00:19.060 --> 01:00:25.820
<v Michael Kennedy>which was running I think Doom which was also Asm.js. If we can do that we could get something

01:00:25.960 --> 01:00:30.800
<v Michael Kennedy>that would run that would read old WebAssembly into new WebAssembly if it really mattered to the world.

01:00:33.440 --> 01:00:39.780
<v David Flood>Absolutely. Yeah. Especially if it's in a public repo that people who care about the data can

01:00:40.260 --> 01:00:47.000
<v Michael Kennedy>can rescue it somehow. Yeah. What about like a virtual machine? You know, I agree. Yeah,

01:00:47.020 --> 01:00:53.960
<v Michael Kennedy>I'm gonna save me some, take a snapshot of Ubuntu LTS,

01:00:54.100 --> 01:00:55.880
<v Michael Kennedy>some version and just, what are we gonna do?

01:00:56.680 --> 01:00:58.560
<v David Flood>- Everything we do is Dockerized.

01:00:59.100 --> 01:00:59.980
<v Michael Kennedy>Everything is in a container.

01:01:00.450 --> 01:01:01.560
<v David Flood>So in the worst case scenario,

01:01:02.010 --> 01:01:03.240
<v David Flood>we could give somebody the image

01:01:03.970 --> 01:01:05.300
<v David Flood>and they could run it if they have Docker.

01:01:06.500 --> 01:01:10.060
<v David Flood>I think that's a nice peace of mind to know that

01:01:10.170 --> 01:01:13.360
<v David Flood>no matter what, something will be able to run this container.

01:01:13.620 --> 01:01:15.660
<v David Flood>And even in, I don't know if you've used GitHub,

01:01:16.340 --> 01:01:17.440
<v David Flood>What is it called? Codespaces.

01:01:18.740 --> 01:01:18.940
<v David Flood>- Yeah.

01:01:19.760 --> 01:01:22.080
<v David Flood>- I've, I've, I archived one project.

01:01:23.480 --> 01:01:25.220
<v David Flood>It was kind of dramatic and all,

01:01:25.440 --> 01:01:27.320
<v David Flood>and sudden that it needed to be archived.

01:01:27.500 --> 01:01:29.260
<v David Flood>So without much time to do anything.

01:01:29.320 --> 01:01:31.660
<v David Flood>And it was a Ruby on Rails project

01:01:31.980 --> 01:01:34.200
<v David Flood>and I'm not a Rails developer,

01:01:34.380 --> 01:01:37.880
<v David Flood>but I was able to get it archived in a way that anybody could

01:01:38.480 --> 01:01:41.320
<v David Flood>with one command, go to the repo on GitHub

01:01:41.640 --> 01:01:45.220
<v David Flood>and boot it up in Codespaces and then have it live.

01:01:46.120 --> 01:01:47.980
<v David Flood>running from their code space.

01:01:48.040 --> 01:01:49.340
<v David Flood>And so that works too.

01:01:51.240 --> 01:01:54.040
<v Michael Kennedy>Very cool. I think as WebAssembly grows,

01:01:54.520 --> 01:01:57.700
<v Michael Kennedy>there'll be more possibilities for these types of things.

01:01:59.780 --> 01:02:03.280
<v Michael Kennedy>Yeah, amazing. I'm pretty excited

01:02:03.460 --> 01:02:05.520
<v Michael Kennedy>about PageFind having a Python API.

01:02:05.620 --> 01:02:06.400
<v Michael Kennedy>I didn't realize that.

01:02:06.540 --> 01:02:09.020
<v Michael Kennedy>So I'm going to be doing something with that for sure.

01:02:12.300 --> 01:02:13.700
<v Michael Kennedy>Let me ask you one more thing

01:02:13.700 --> 01:02:19.180
<v Michael Kennedy>forward, I kind of let you wrap up with some final thoughts here. What about AI?

01:02:20.700 --> 01:02:27.640
<v David Flood>Oh, that's a good question. So AI, I mean, there's like, in my story, there's like one

01:02:27.840 --> 01:02:33.900
<v David Flood>interesting part of AI, which is that I got started and self-learned everything I needed

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:41.319
<v David Flood>to about software development to begin doing this right before ChatGPT really came on and was able

01:02:41.340 --> 01:02:48.420
<v Michael Kennedy>to do real programming yeah you're like four years of legit programming before right so i think i

01:02:48.520 --> 01:02:52.340
<v David Flood>mean so i was thinking i was thinking and i was thinking about how i got into it i thought what

01:02:52.500 --> 01:03:02.120
<v David Flood>if i was four years later starting my phd and wanting to do these tools um i would have been

01:03:02.160 --> 01:03:08.760
<v David Flood>able to accomplish what i needed to for my research without acquiring the technical skills i know and

01:03:08.780 --> 01:03:12.020
<v Michael Kennedy>I don't know that's a good thing. I'm not sure if that's a good or bad thing. It could be both.

01:03:12.170 --> 01:03:29.260
<v David Flood>I would have thought it was a good thing. I would have thought it's a good thing. But in my hands now, like a software engineer, AI is more powerful in my hands now than it would have been then.

01:03:30.240 --> 01:03:31.720
<v Michael Kennedy>Even the same model, same everything.

01:03:31.840 --> 01:03:36.380
<v David Flood>for me. Yeah, I can make it work for me in a way that I couldn't have been able to then. So I'm

01:03:36.560 --> 01:03:41.860
<v David Flood>thankful for that. But it's something I think of, you know, I don't want to say it's a necessarily

01:03:41.990 --> 01:03:47.580
<v David Flood>a bad thing. But it definitely marks a difference, a difference in time between other people who are

01:03:48.220 --> 01:03:53.140
<v David Flood>maybe wanting to get into digital humanities, their humanities researchers, they want to add

01:03:53.150 --> 01:03:58.660
<v David Flood>some digital tools. You know, I think this will kind of this will probably knock people off of

01:03:58.680 --> 01:03:59.980
<v David Flood>the more technical path.

01:04:00.680 --> 01:04:01.700
<v Michael Kennedy>I think it will too.

01:04:01.850 --> 01:04:03.800
<v Michael Kennedy>And I think that that might be a negative.

01:04:04.080 --> 01:04:07.000
<v Michael Kennedy>When you were telling me your story originally,

01:04:07.630 --> 01:04:12.520
<v Michael Kennedy>I was thinking kind of like how neat is it that you didn't sign up for

01:04:12.570 --> 01:04:15.900
<v Michael Kennedy>and the people you were working with probably didn't intend to sign you up

01:04:16.020 --> 01:04:18.960
<v Michael Kennedy>for learning true software development.

01:04:19.610 --> 01:04:22.940
<v Michael Kennedy>But look at this cool and interesting job that you now have

01:04:23.560 --> 01:04:24.900
<v Michael Kennedy>that you never would have imagined.

01:04:25.180 --> 01:04:26.780
<v Michael Kennedy>I'm sure when you signed up for your PhD,

01:04:26.810 --> 01:04:28.440
<v Michael Kennedy>you're like, you know what I'm going to do when I get my PhD?

01:04:28.600 --> 01:04:31.260
<v Michael Kennedy>I'm going to go X, Y, like, I'm going to join the Darth program.

01:04:31.380 --> 01:04:34.020
<v Michael Kennedy>Like, no, probably not. Right. But here you are.

01:04:34.740 --> 01:04:38.260
<v Michael Kennedy>And I think that's actually a really interesting knock on effect for a lot of

01:04:38.560 --> 01:04:41.300
<v Michael Kennedy>researchers and people in grad schools.

01:04:41.660 --> 01:04:44.960
<v Michael Kennedy>They're kind of put into this programming adjacent type of thing.

01:04:46.100 --> 01:04:49.760
<v Michael Kennedy>You know, and a lot of folks sort of, actually, that's pretty interesting.

01:04:49.960 --> 01:04:53.160
<v Michael Kennedy>I'm going to kind of lean into that. And I think AI might knock,

01:04:54.580 --> 01:04:56.560
<v Michael Kennedy>not like you said, knock people off that path to some degree.

01:04:57.800 --> 01:05:22.000
<v David Flood>Yeah, definitely. So that's just one part of the AI story. The other one is how we use it. It's great for data extraction, pulling data out of different, to make these search interfaces more powerful, to extract different data from them. That's just one example where it's been handy.

01:05:22.780 --> 01:05:27.700
<v David Flood>we're looking for ways that it can really empower faculty.

01:05:28.380 --> 01:05:30.840
<v David Flood>You know, we're still very much in the exploration phase

01:05:31.040 --> 01:05:34.220
<v David Flood>of like how we can use it and provide it to faculty

01:05:34.620 --> 01:05:37.520
<v David Flood>as a like digital humanities tool.

01:05:38.380 --> 01:05:40.140
<v Michael Kennedy>- Sure, I was thinking pretty much

01:05:40.780 --> 01:05:41.800
<v Michael Kennedy>when I asked the question of it,

01:05:41.820 --> 01:05:44.800
<v Michael Kennedy>it's just like two parts, like one, how does it,

01:05:45.020 --> 01:05:48.080
<v Michael Kennedy>are you guys using it to help take project?

01:05:48.260 --> 01:05:49.100
<v Michael Kennedy>Well, that would have been a month.

01:05:49.180 --> 01:05:50.140
<v Michael Kennedy>No, actually it's three days.

01:05:50.540 --> 01:05:51.060
<v Michael Kennedy>You know what I mean?

01:05:52.200 --> 01:05:57.880
<v Michael Kennedy>that and then if people are asking you know a professor comes along and says and we want our

01:05:57.930 --> 01:06:05.280
<v Michael Kennedy>own custom ai thing or we're using harvard's internal one that we're allowed to use

01:06:06.880 --> 01:06:09.400
<v Michael Kennedy>but we won't be able to use it once the grant runs out you know what i mean

01:06:11.120 --> 01:06:16.340
<v David Flood>yeah yeah i think um one one good example of this type of thing is that um what we're starting to

01:06:16.280 --> 01:06:20.540
<v David Flood>to get is faculty who are vibe coding.

01:06:21.160 --> 01:06:23.300
<v David Flood>And now we're going to teach them.

01:06:23.780 --> 01:06:25.020
<v David Flood>We're going to teach them how to do it.

01:06:25.860 --> 01:06:25.960
<v Michael Kennedy>Yeah.

01:06:26.600 --> 01:06:27.120
<v David Flood>Instead of--

01:06:27.120 --> 01:06:27.780
<v Michael Kennedy>It is a skill.

01:06:28.520 --> 01:06:28.860
<v David Flood>Yeah.

01:06:28.940 --> 01:06:30.120
<v David Flood>It's absolutely a skill.

01:06:30.940 --> 01:06:31.140
<v David Flood>Yeah.

01:06:31.220 --> 01:06:31.780
<v David Flood>No, it is.

01:06:31.900 --> 01:06:32.260
<v David Flood>It is.

01:06:33.020 --> 01:06:37.980
<v David Flood>Instead of copy and pasting from ChatGPT into VS Code,

01:06:39.400 --> 01:06:42.060
<v David Flood>having them learn Copilot, maybe even having them download

01:06:42.300 --> 01:06:42.460
<v David Flood>cursor.

01:06:43.100 --> 01:06:45.660
<v David Flood>Download some real dedicated tools

01:06:45.680 --> 01:06:47.880
<v David Flood>to get this done to make them more productive.

01:06:48.320 --> 01:06:52.820
<v David Flood>So yeah, educating about how to do it is one thing.

01:06:53.740 --> 01:06:54.760
<v David Flood>You asked if we're using it.

01:06:55.920 --> 01:07:02.640
<v David Flood>We have access to a co-pilot and that's great.

01:07:04.820 --> 01:07:06.540
<v David Flood>I can't say that we've shipped anything in three days

01:07:06.940 --> 01:07:10.500
<v David Flood>instead of a month yet, but one anecdote is that

01:07:11.880 --> 01:07:13.620
<v David Flood>right now I'm doing some really interesting

01:07:15.400 --> 01:07:22.420
<v David Flood>Processing of music of music audio files and somebody asked to have a beatboxer if I could chop that file up

01:07:22.860 --> 01:07:29.100
<v David Flood>So that all of the individual sounds that the beatboxer makes are identified in a file and so okay

01:07:30.120 --> 01:07:34.400
<v David Flood>So I'm using some music library. So a Python library library called Librosa

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:38.400
<v David Flood>There's some complicated math in there. It's a little bit too much for me

01:07:39.080 --> 01:07:45.360
<v David Flood>It's no problem for Claude Claude knows how to do that math and then and I use my expertise to string it together to get

01:07:45.600 --> 01:07:53.420
<v Michael Kennedy>good output. Yeah, awesome. You got time for one more quick question before we clap things up.

01:07:53.420 --> 01:07:58.320
<v Michael Kennedy>For sure. Raymond out there, Raymond Yees asks, it says, it'd be good to hear how Harvard uses

01:07:59.240 --> 01:08:04.160
<v Michael Kennedy>containers on AWS and its reliability. It's reliable, not the cheapest way to host things.

01:08:05.280 --> 01:08:11.420
<v Michael Kennedy>Are you thinking about moving that or is it not that much, you know, not that big of an expense?

01:08:11.440 --> 01:08:21.839
<v David Flood>about a failed experiment. We were using ECS and we're still using ECS. So that's AWS's main,

01:08:22.759 --> 01:08:28.859
<v David Flood>it's not Kubernetes, but it's one step down with their horizontal scaling container clusters.

01:08:30.859 --> 01:08:36.100
<v David Flood>And I wanted to move us onto a single EC2 instance because our projects are popular,

01:08:36.319 --> 01:08:39.900
<v David Flood>but they're not so popular that we actually have to worry about horizontal scaling.

01:08:40.080 --> 01:08:46.600
<v Michael Kennedy>Right. It's not like it's front page in New York Times. I guess it probably could be. But even so,

01:08:46.630 --> 01:08:48.759
<v Michael Kennedy>for the static sites, they probably still can take it.

01:08:50.049 --> 01:08:55.640
<v David Flood>Yeah. So I priced it out and I got an example deployed, an example project deployed,

01:08:56.420 --> 01:09:03.199
<v David Flood>and was able to confirm that it would indeed be much cheaper. And it was deployed in a similar way

01:09:03.220 --> 01:09:10.319
<v David Flood>using AWS CDK. So it's all infrastructure is code all the way down. But it turns out there's all

01:09:10.500 --> 01:09:16.180
<v David Flood>kinds of compliance when you are in charge of the VM at like a big university, or I'm sure any

01:09:16.620 --> 01:09:23.620
<v David Flood>any corporate setting, if you are in charge of the VM and the OS on it, then you have to know that you

01:09:23.700 --> 01:09:28.720
<v David Flood>have the latest patches in. You have to know that you have latest Ubuntu. And then there's other

01:09:28.740 --> 01:09:35.759
<v David Flood>things of different observability things that you have to have in place that you that are not usually

01:09:35.980 --> 01:09:41.859
<v David Flood>required if you're running in a container cluster like ecs i see so it ends up being a lot less

01:09:42.540 --> 01:09:48.020
<v David Flood>a lot less work and much easier to achieve compliance if we run containers or some other

01:09:48.180 --> 01:09:54.960
<v David Flood>serverless some other serverless thing if i run my all my personal projects they all run in a single

01:09:55.020 --> 01:10:01.500
<v David Flood>a single virtual machine but um sure we're running in containers yeah yeah and you've got all the

01:10:01.640 --> 01:10:08.520
<v Michael Kennedy>sock 2 stuff and all those different things right like there's layers yeah that's right awesome okay

01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:16.360
<v Michael Kennedy>yeah very cool final thoughts you want to talk to people who may be doing similar all right go ahead

01:10:16.660 --> 01:10:20.760
<v Michael Kennedy>you've got something more to add for you yeah i mean i'll mention that um but what i didn't say is

01:10:20.660 --> 01:10:28.060
<v David Flood>that in that 2019 when i started learning python i discovered talk python almost immediately and

01:10:28.180 --> 01:10:33.780
<v David Flood>one of the first episodes that i listened to was was the other digital humanities um the one with

01:10:34.260 --> 01:10:39.140
<v Michael Kennedy>cornelius van lit he was an awesome guest yeah that's right yeah and i thought i thought that

01:10:39.140 --> 01:10:44.620
<v David Flood>was great and that was also a bit about manuscripts a little bit more in the image side than the text

01:10:44.800 --> 01:10:50.620
<v David Flood>side and um i didn't understand everything that everybody was saying but i just i kept tuning

01:10:50.640 --> 01:10:56.180
<v David Flood>in. And I think because of that, because Talk Python was like this, you know, I've been remote

01:10:56.590 --> 01:11:03.480
<v David Flood>working for most of my time. And Talk Python has been kind of like that conversation with

01:11:03.610 --> 01:11:08.340
<v David Flood>the open source community that's been always in my ear. And I think that made, you know,

01:11:08.510 --> 01:11:14.820
<v David Flood>a difference making me feel like I understood the software landscape and like the developer

01:11:14.940 --> 01:11:19.660
<v David Flood>culture and what was going on. And then the different Python libraries and what was possible.

01:11:20.400 --> 01:11:32.520
<v David Flood>So to people who are interested in taking things in a more technical direction, I think it's helpful just to find a few things like that, that give you an insight into that world.

01:11:32.980 --> 01:11:43.320
<v David Flood>And the more you listen to it, the more you start to hear the same acronyms and the same things said enough that you start to feel like, okay, now you're part of the club.

01:11:43.820 --> 01:11:45.060
<v Michael Kennedy>I really appreciate that.

01:11:45.940 --> 01:11:46.300
<v Michael Kennedy>That's cool.

01:11:46.880 --> 01:11:52.140
<v Michael Kennedy>I've certainly had people reach out to me and say things that at first didn't make any sense to me.

01:11:52.260 --> 01:11:56.440
<v Michael Kennedy>Like, I've been listening for six weeks now, and it's starting to make sense what you're talking about.

01:11:56.500 --> 01:11:58.720
<v Michael Kennedy>Like, why have you been listening for six months when it made no sense?

01:11:58.860 --> 01:11:59.200
<v Michael Kennedy>That's insane.

01:11:59.820 --> 01:12:06.640
<v Michael Kennedy>But a lot of people use listening to the podcast, mine and others, as language immersion, right?

01:12:06.880 --> 01:12:13.000
<v Michael Kennedy>Like, I could get Duolingo, and I could learn Portuguese, or I could move to Brazil for a month.

01:12:13.340 --> 01:12:13.800
<v Michael Kennedy>You know what I mean?

01:12:14.100 --> 01:12:15.060
<v Michael Kennedy>Then I would really learn it.

01:12:15.120 --> 01:12:15.220
<v Michael Kennedy>Yeah, exactly.

01:12:15.580 --> 01:12:15.840
<v Michael Kennedy>Right.

01:12:16.600 --> 01:12:23.820
<v David Flood>Exactly. I think there's truth to that. Some of the things I did was search the word deployment

01:12:24.440 --> 01:12:28.340
<v David Flood>because I'm trying to get my head around how to deploy for the first time. I just want to hear

01:12:28.480 --> 01:12:32.280
<v David Flood>people talk about it. I could read about it. I could read the tutorial, but I just want to hear

01:12:32.400 --> 01:12:37.560
<v David Flood>people talk about deployment to get a sense of what actual deployment sounds like.

01:12:37.860 --> 01:12:42.940
<v Michael Kennedy>There's something really different when you're learning or trying, even you're maybe an experienced

01:12:42.960 --> 01:12:48.820
<v Michael Kennedy>programmer but not in this particular area to hear a human side of it not just the docs not a sterile

01:12:49.260 --> 01:12:55.160
<v Michael Kennedy>these are the four steps but like a human i love it i mean it's probably why i create the show

01:12:55.420 --> 01:13:00.840
<v Michael Kennedy>because like i didn't hear those stories we got to tell those stories awesome i appreciate that so

01:13:02.100 --> 01:13:06.980
<v Michael Kennedy>super cool all right so if other people are listening maybe one of your pieces of advice is

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:15.480
<v David Flood>keep listening you'll get there yeah and and if anybody's in is like in the humanities and somehow

01:13:15.620 --> 01:13:22.120
<v David Flood>found their way onto this episode with no technical uh experience i just would would give the caution

01:13:22.280 --> 01:13:29.840
<v David Flood>of of like you know the anecdote that if um ai coding had been around the way it is now when i

01:13:29.940 --> 01:13:36.620
<v David Flood>was learning i wouldn't be doing digital humanities at harvard i wouldn't have been able to get into

01:13:36.640 --> 01:13:39.240
<v David Flood>this field, I wouldn't have known about it.

01:13:39.980 --> 01:13:45.280
<v David Flood>So I guess just think about that when you're learning and applying new tools.

01:13:46.960 --> 01:13:49.740
<v Michael Kennedy>I don't really know what the right fix for that is.

01:13:49.840 --> 01:13:51.080
<v Michael Kennedy>That's a very challenging problem.

01:13:51.300 --> 01:13:54.780
<v Michael Kennedy>I mean, you can say I'm just literally not going to fire it up.

01:13:54.940 --> 01:13:59.440
<v Michael Kennedy>But I mean, we used to hunt through Stack Overflow and the web and over and over.

01:13:59.560 --> 01:14:03.680
<v Michael Kennedy>And if you're really stuck or you really don't understand, like they're good at explaining

01:14:03.780 --> 01:14:04.260
<v Michael Kennedy>stuff to you.

01:14:04.800 --> 01:14:10.220
<v Michael Kennedy>really stay in a learner's mindset, not just press the easy button and make this thing and move on.

01:14:13.440 --> 01:14:18.940
<v Michael Kennedy>Easier said than done. Easier and said than done. So yeah, I just I want to leave this with kind of a

01:14:19.800 --> 01:14:29.239
<v Michael Kennedy>thought about how much things like Python and these, these tools and technology can really empower

01:14:29.940 --> 01:14:31.460
<v Michael Kennedy>stuff that you wouldn't think is even related,

01:14:31.980 --> 01:14:33.400
<v Michael Kennedy>like understanding old manuscripts

01:14:33.800 --> 01:14:40.480
<v Michael Kennedy>and how painting is connected or changed over time and stuff, right?

01:14:40.680 --> 01:14:43.720
<v Michael Kennedy>Those sound very much disjointed from tech and software,

01:14:44.200 --> 01:14:47.800
<v Michael Kennedy>but they really are superpowers that you can bring to your work,

01:14:48.460 --> 01:14:50.000
<v Michael Kennedy>whatever your industry is.

01:14:50.020 --> 01:14:51.540
<v Michael Kennedy>I know our field of study,

01:14:51.560 --> 01:14:54.540
<v Michael Kennedy>I know there's some sociologists out in the audience

01:14:54.720 --> 01:14:55.700
<v Michael Kennedy>and I'm sure others as well.

01:14:58.960 --> 01:15:01.500
<v Michael Kennedy>All right. Final thoughts, David, close it out.

01:15:09.800 --> 01:15:10.400
<v David Flood>That's it.

01:15:10.820 --> 01:15:11.400
<v David Flood>That's it. All right.

01:15:12.280 --> 01:15:12.800
<v David Flood>You said it great.

01:15:12.990 --> 01:15:18.600
<v David Flood>I mean, just applying these technical tools to old questions,

01:15:19.170 --> 01:15:21.080
<v David Flood>that is the core of digital humanities.

01:15:21.940 --> 01:15:22.520
<v Michael Kennedy>Awesome. Yeah.

01:15:24.080 --> 01:15:25.120
<v Michael Kennedy>When I first started hearing about this,

01:15:25.120 --> 01:15:26.900
<v Michael Kennedy>I thought I really don't know how this ties together.

01:15:27.120 --> 01:15:30.760
<v Michael Kennedy>and after seeing it a few times, I definitely see the power of it.

01:15:31.680 --> 01:15:32.980
<v Michael Kennedy>Thank you for your time coming on.

01:15:33.220 --> 01:15:37.460
<v Michael Kennedy>Thank you for sharing your look and the look inside of your team

01:15:37.800 --> 01:15:40.200
<v Michael Kennedy>and inside of a small piece of Harvard.

01:15:41.240 --> 01:15:43.020
<v Michael Kennedy>I really like these kinds of episodes

01:15:43.320 --> 01:15:46.000
<v Michael Kennedy>because it's hard to see this from the outside.

01:15:47.260 --> 01:15:48.720
<v Michael Kennedy>You just see the results,

01:15:48.830 --> 01:15:51.000
<v Michael Kennedy>but you don't see the inner workings of the team

01:15:51.070 --> 01:15:51.980
<v Michael Kennedy>and the motivation and stuff.

01:15:52.840 --> 01:15:54.460
<v Michael Kennedy>Thank you so much for being here.

01:15:55.760 --> 01:15:56.420
<v Michael Kennedy>Bye, everyone.

01:15:56.860 --> 01:15:57.000
<v Michael Kennedy>Yep.
