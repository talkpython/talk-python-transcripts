1
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:06,640
Michael Kennedy: Trevor, welcome to Talk Python To Me. Awesome to have you here. Thanks for coming.

2
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:08,060
Trevor Manz: Yeah, thanks for having me, Michael.

3
00:00:08,879 --> 00:00:15,360
Michael Kennedy: Yeah. We're going to talk about building Lego blocks for data scientists. Is that maybe a good

4
00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:19,860
Trevor Manz: way to put it? Yeah, definitely. Yeah, so we're going to talk about your project,

5
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:25,760
Michael Kennedy: AnyWidget, which is a super cool project that allows people to build

6
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:34,860
Michael Kennedy: more adaptable, more reusable widgets rather than just saying I'm going to build it for Jupyter or

7
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:39,780
Michael Kennedy: Remo or whatever. But I'm going to build something that can be used broadly through your platform

8
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:45,580
Michael Kennedy: and a lot simpler deployment as well. So I know a lot of people out there are excited.

9
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:50,280
Michael Kennedy: Not everyone necessarily wants to build widgets, but this also makes more widgets

10
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:53,180
Michael Kennedy: available for people, right? So super cool project.

11
00:00:55,540 --> 00:00:55,900
Michael Kennedy: Yeah.

12
00:00:57,740 --> 00:01:01,780
Michael Kennedy: And before we get into that, of course, maybe just tell us a bit about yourself.

13
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:03,920
Trevor Manz: Yeah, so I'm Trevor.

14
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:06,560
Trevor Manz: I'm a software engineer at Marimo.

15
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:13,940
Trevor Manz: But prior to being at Marimo, I was doing my PhD in data visualization at Harvard Medical School.

16
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:20,880
Trevor Manz: So I got into this whole Python web world from working on tools for biological scientists

17
00:01:21,230 --> 00:01:25,480
Trevor Manz: to explore large genomics or spatial genomic data sets.

18
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:28,640
Michael Kennedy: That is a super interesting topic.

19
00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:34,420
Michael Kennedy: I'm sure there were some really niche things you had to build, right?

20
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:37,380
Michael Kennedy: We have this crazy research machine.

21
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:38,660
Michael Kennedy: There's three of them in the world.

22
00:01:38,810 --> 00:01:41,060
Michael Kennedy: And here's the data that comes out of it.

23
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:44,420
Michael Kennedy: How do I put that into notebooks or whatever, right?

24
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:46,600
Trevor Manz: Yeah, yeah, exactly.

25
00:01:46,850 --> 00:01:47,980
Trevor Manz: And it's funny you mentioned that.

26
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:51,720
Trevor Manz: I think starting off in more like the visualization side,

27
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:54,760
Trevor Manz: we'd build these very bespoke and custom applications

28
00:01:55,050 --> 00:01:57,400
Trevor Manz: for looking at large biological data sets.

29
00:01:57,980 --> 00:01:59,800
Trevor Manz: And then I think a motivation for me

30
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:01,800
Trevor Manz: was realizing a lot of the folks that I was working with

31
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:04,900
Trevor Manz: to build these tools for worked in Python

32
00:02:05,090 --> 00:02:06,420
Trevor Manz: and worked in notebooks specifically.

33
00:02:06,610 --> 00:02:08,160
Trevor Manz: And so there was sort of this gap between

34
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:10,940
Trevor Manz: the research that we were doing to build these specialized tools

35
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:12,840
Trevor Manz: and trying to meet users where they were at

36
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:15,080
Trevor Manz: to actually use those tools in their research

37
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,380
Trevor Manz: and as a part of their data exploration workflows.

38
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:19,840
Michael Kennedy: And this was your PhD work?

39
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:21,960
Trevor Manz: Yes, yeah, this was my PhD work.

40
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:22,780
Michael Kennedy: Incredible.

41
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:25,600
Michael Kennedy: So I'm sure it wasn't just Python.

42
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:27,700
Michael Kennedy: No.

43
00:02:28,599 --> 00:02:29,800
Michael Kennedy: What was involved with it?

44
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:34,960
Trevor Manz: So, yeah, I'd say the research community, at least in bio,

45
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:36,900
Trevor Manz: is sort of split between R and Python,

46
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,560
Trevor Manz: but specifically some of our closest collaborators

47
00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:40,820
Trevor Manz: were in the Python ecosystem.

48
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:47,700
Trevor Manz: And then my team was building a lot of user interfaces for visual exploration of data sets.

49
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:52,920
Trevor Manz: And I think Notebook sort of became this base, and specifically Python Notebooks, where you

50
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:56,660
Trevor Manz: can really blend those programmatic and user interfaces together.

51
00:02:57,420 --> 00:03:02,580
Trevor Manz: That's sort of why I centered on trying to solve some of the rough edges about bringing

52
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:05,280
Michael Kennedy: these interactive tools inside of Notebooks.

53
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:06,640
Michael Kennedy: That's cool.

54
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:11,800
Michael Kennedy: Did you do any other platforms?

55
00:03:12,210 --> 00:03:19,740
Michael Kennedy: I'm thinking like Unity or the Real Engine for flying through data?

56
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:21,080
Michael Kennedy: What else did you all do?

57
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:28,960
Trevor Manz: Yeah, there were some folks on my team that are currently working in more spatial AR, VR type scenarios.

58
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,060
Trevor Manz: And that I think is based on the Unity engine.

59
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:33,120
Trevor Manz: Most of my work was web-based.

60
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:43,220
Trevor Manz: And specifically, and we'll probably get into it, I think the web is just a really important platform to develop for in the sense that, I mean, we're recording right now in a web browser.

61
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:48,620
Trevor Manz: It's a very capable platform that everyone sort of has an entry point to on some sort of device.

62
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:57,320
Trevor Manz: And so developing for the web often means that you can reuse a lot of that application amongst different devices and in different contexts.

63
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:01,520
Michael Kennedy: It's unbelievable what the web can do these days.

64
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:14,600
Michael Kennedy: I made the comment before we started, like, I can't believe this is a web browser that we're building, that we're doing this live streaming, video sharing, local recording, all this stuff is just like, it's so wild.

65
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:18,959
Michael Kennedy: And, you know, I built an app recently that I'm using to kind of help out with some of the interview stuff.

66
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,640
Michael Kennedy: And it's on the web.

67
00:04:20,709 --> 00:04:21,739
Michael Kennedy: It just runs on my iPad.

68
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,300
Michael Kennedy: You know, I mean, it's like, it goes underappreciated some of the time.

69
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:28,520
Michael Kennedy: I think it was just like how far you can push it.

70
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:28,660
Michael Kennedy: Right.

71
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:31,620
Michael Kennedy: It's not just documents and Ajax.

72
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:33,180
Trevor Manz: Yeah, yeah.

73
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:36,620
Trevor Manz: The fact that a version of Photoshop runs in the browser is pretty amazing.

74
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:40,580
Trevor Manz: And Figma itself is all running in the web browser.

75
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,540
Trevor Manz: So it's definitely a capable platform.

76
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:47,800
Trevor Manz: But one thing it's not very good at is, or doesn't have the ecosystem for, is a lot of data work.

77
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,640
Trevor Manz: And I think that that's really the big divide.

78
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:57,220
Trevor Manz: So I see the web as really one of the most accessible platforms for building user interfaces and applications.

79
00:04:58,060 --> 00:05:02,420
Trevor Manz: But then there's this whole other world, which is like tools that you actually do data science stuff in.

80
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:09,340
Trevor Manz: And that is not the web whatsoever, but has like a similar amount of maturity in terms of being very ergonomic and good at doing that type of work.

81
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:18,940
Michael Kennedy: Right. And those two worlds meet in the web, right?

82
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:23,800
Michael Kennedy: But the people doing the Python work, they aren't necessarily web developers.

83
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:29,320
Michael Kennedy: You gave a talk a year ago about any widget that I'll definitely link to.

84
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:34,240
Michael Kennedy: And you have this graphic here like, okay, we've got the front end,

85
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:38,440
Michael Kennedy: which often is Jupyter, not always, as we'll see in a minute.

86
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:44,820
Michael Kennedy: But often is Jupyter with the way you build for it is with all these web front end tools

87
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:49,540
Michael Kennedy: that even me doing web development is a lot of times I'm like,

88
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:51,260
Michael Kennedy: what is this and why is it so complicated?

89
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,220
Michael Kennedy: I just don't even know.

90
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:55,260
Michael Kennedy: And I do web stuff all the time.

91
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:59,380
Michael Kennedy: And then you've got the backend stuff where Python people live doing NumPy,

92
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:01,960
Michael Kennedy: pollers, at Plotlib, et cetera.

93
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:05,260
Michael Kennedy: Do you want to riff on that challenge a little bit?

94
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:08,160
Michael Kennedy: Because I know your project is really here to kind of solve some of this

95
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:09,480
Michael Kennedy: disjointedness.

96
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:10,220
Trevor Manz: Yeah.

97
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:13,220
Trevor Manz: I think one interesting thing, like taking a step back,

98
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:15,640
Trevor Manz: and I mentioned this in the talk that I gave a while back,

99
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:20,000
Trevor Manz: but the web and Python ecosystems have been around for almost the same exact

100
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:20,680
Trevor Manz: amount of time.

101
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:25,660
Trevor Manz: I think the first web page was around the same year that the first release of Python came out.

102
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:29,780
Trevor Manz: And so they sort of have been evolving in their own respective,

103
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:33,080
Trevor Manz: or developing their own respective ecosystems for that period of time.

104
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:37,540
Trevor Manz: And then as the web became really this platform for building user interfaces,

105
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:45,460
Trevor Manz: I think that some pretty visionary folks saw that you could connect these backend resources

106
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:49,220
Trevor Manz: to these very interactive applications that could be developed very quickly.

107
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:53,840
Trevor Manz: So over the years, these things that started off very far apart have now come very close together.

108
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:58,960
Trevor Manz: And now with WebAssembly, sometimes it's just turtles all the way down.

109
00:06:59,140 --> 00:07:00,320
Trevor Manz: It's all actually running in the browser.

110
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,200
Trevor Manz: So it's pretty amazing.

111
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:05,120
Trevor Manz: But I think that there definitely is this friction.

112
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:10,280
Trevor Manz: And one thing I've also noticed from being in both the web and Python ecosystems for so long

113
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:15,540
Trevor Manz: is sort of these ebbs and flows of maturity or places that need to catch up to one another.

114
00:07:15,690 --> 00:07:19,160
Trevor Manz: And so I came from definitely the web side originally.

115
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:28,380
Trevor Manz: And there's a lot that I took for granted, I guess, in that ecosystem of tooling that for a while, I think, gave the language a very bad rap.

116
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:32,660
Trevor Manz: Because it was sort of the scripting language that was invented, I think, famously in two weeks.

117
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:35,600
Trevor Manz: And now people are trying to build applications in it.

118
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:40,060
Trevor Manz: But over the years, there have been standards and things have matured.

119
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:47,040
Trevor Manz: And actually, the web is very backwards compatible and has some of these properties that are kind of amazing for something that's been around for that long.

120
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:49,440
Trevor Manz: And then I'd say in the last couple of years,

121
00:07:49,650 --> 00:07:55,140
Trevor Manz: like we've seen a bunch of like new developer tool work

122
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:57,580
Trevor Manz: going into the Python ecosystem that in some part

123
00:07:57,580 --> 00:08:00,080
Trevor Manz: is also inspired by some of the tooling in like the web ecosystem.

124
00:08:00,210 --> 00:08:02,520
Trevor Manz: So I love to see sort of how these things go back and forth.

125
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:06,860
Trevor Manz: And I think if you haven't checked in on the ecosystem for a while,

126
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:09,320
Trevor Manz: you might think like it's, you know,

127
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:12,260
Trevor Manz: it isn't what it was five years ago as it is today.

128
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:15,699
Trevor Manz: And one of the goals of AnyWidget is to try to like demystify

129
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:22,200
Trevor Manz: some of the maybe those like prior bad experiences folks had developing and just you know get back

130
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:26,980
Trevor Manz: to like opening up some html and writing some javascript um and and getting your python data

131
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:32,340
Michael Kennedy: in the browser yeah yeah absolutely you know i wonder as you describe it being made in

132
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:40,179
Michael Kennedy: in uh two weeks which i also think this is this is true when it was made i think at mozilla right

133
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:49,700
Michael Kennedy: yeah anyway java one of the javascript's real issues is it doesn't have a real

134
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:57,060
Michael Kennedy: numerical system right everything is a float that has a lot of problems for data science when it

135
00:08:57,280 --> 00:09:02,020
Michael Kennedy: really really has to be integers or whatever right like you need more control over the numbers

136
00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:09,699
Michael Kennedy: i wonder how much of python's benefit in the data science space originates from people going

137
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:14,880
Michael Kennedy: JavaScript is super popular, but can't do numbers there. I do science, can't do JavaScript. What am

138
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:17,420
Michael Kennedy: I doing now? You know what I mean? What do you think about that? It just occurred to me.

139
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:25,560
Trevor Manz: Yeah. It's interesting. That is originally a constraint of the language and maybe when you're

140
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:32,480
Trevor Manz: picking ecosystems early on. Also, there was no server way to run JavaScript until 2010. So the

141
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:39,580
Trevor Manz: idea of just running this without a browser was also not very good. So yeah, I'm not quite sure,

142
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:42,840
Trevor Manz: but it's funny because JavaScript has reacted to that

143
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:45,820
Trevor Manz: by adding some big ints as a data type,

144
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:48,680
Trevor Manz: but also now there's a fourth language for the web,

145
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:49,560
Trevor Manz: which is WebAssembly,

146
00:09:49,770 --> 00:09:52,160
Trevor Manz: and there are proper data types in WebAssembly.

147
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:56,420
Trevor Manz: I guess it is reactionary, but I haven't really seen.

148
00:09:57,060 --> 00:09:58,440
Trevor Manz: Now you can run Python in the browser,

149
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:02,940
Trevor Manz: but you'd have to have all this ecosystem grift or migration

150
00:10:03,130 --> 00:10:04,880
Trevor Manz: that I just don't think anybody wants.

151
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:08,500
Trevor Manz: Maybe these ecosystems can play a lot nicer together.

152
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:10,200
Michael Kennedy: Yeah.

153
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:11,120
Michael Kennedy: Yeah.

154
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:14,280
Michael Kennedy: And certainly they are with things like Jupyter and stuff, right?

155
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,620
Michael Kennedy: Most users of Jupyter don't write JavaScript.

156
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:19,520
Trevor Manz: Yes.

157
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:21,700
Trevor Manz: And I think that everyone's happy about that.

158
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:23,400
Michael Kennedy: Exactly.

159
00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:24,000
Michael Kennedy: That's true.

160
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:25,120
Michael Kennedy: There's a lot of people are like, you know what?

161
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:25,720
Michael Kennedy: That's not for me.

162
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:33,900
Michael Kennedy: So, you know, you were at Harvard doing your work and now you're at Marimo.

163
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:36,280
Michael Kennedy: I always mess up saying this.

164
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:37,980
Michael Kennedy: Tell us how to do it.

165
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:38,800
Trevor Manz: It's Marimo.

166
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:39,840
Michael Kennedy: Marimo.

167
00:10:40,090 --> 00:10:40,680
Michael Kennedy: Okay, Marimo.

168
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:46,740
Michael Kennedy: Yeah, and I'd actually on, and I know we talked a lot about it, and he set me straight, and then I drifted, I'm sure.

169
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:52,100
Michael Kennedy: So what's your experiences here?

170
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:55,500
Michael Kennedy: How's it coming from academia to this world?

171
00:10:56,660 --> 00:10:57,180
Trevor Manz: It's been great.

172
00:10:57,340 --> 00:11:04,760
Trevor Manz: I think that having worked with, so part of AnyWidget was trying to address some user needs working inside of notebooks,

173
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,460
Trevor Manz: and there's only so much that you can do

174
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:07,580
Trevor Manz: sort of as like a plugin

175
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:11,660
Trevor Manz: to get that extra bit to like help users.

176
00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:13,360
Trevor Manz: And so I think one really exciting thing

177
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:15,520
Trevor Manz: about working on this team with Marimo

178
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:16,920
Trevor Manz: is they got very involved

179
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:19,320
Trevor Manz: or they were aware of AnyWidget like a while ago

180
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:22,600
Trevor Manz: and they kind of actually like legitimized AnyWidget

181
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:25,140
Trevor Manz: as like, hey, this is a standard

182
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:26,540
Trevor Manz: because we were able to like implement

183
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:28,060
Trevor Manz: around like this specification.

184
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:30,580
Trevor Manz: And so that got us together.

185
00:11:30,770 --> 00:11:32,660
Trevor Manz: And then from there, it's just been super exciting

186
00:11:32,690 --> 00:11:34,820
Trevor Manz: to work with the team that is like so passionate

187
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:37,920
Trevor Manz: about notebooks and thinking about this next generation of notebooks

188
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:40,640
Trevor Manz: and what that environment needs to look like.

189
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:43,580
Trevor Manz: And so there's much more that we can do inside of Marimo

190
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:45,300
Trevor Manz: beyond the AnyWidget specification,

191
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:48,360
Trevor Manz: but also AnyWidget is an important component of that.

192
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:51,620
Trevor Manz: So I like to be able to sort of think about both of these two worlds.

193
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:52,360
Michael Kennedy: That's cool.

194
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:58,980
Michael Kennedy: So when I use widgets in Marimo, it's often an AnyWidget?

195
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:00,440
Trevor Manz: Yep. Yeah, exactly.

196
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:04,180
Trevor Manz: So when folks usually come and they want to extend Marimo

197
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:05,660
Trevor Manz: with their own custom UI elements,

198
00:12:05,970 --> 00:12:09,000
Trevor Manz: like our answer is you should make an AnyWidget.

199
00:12:09,850 --> 00:12:10,800
Trevor Manz: So that's pretty exciting.

200
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:13,720
Trevor Manz: But then if you're using things in like the sidebar

201
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:15,520
Trevor Manz: or things that like sort of integrate outside

202
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:16,720
Trevor Manz: of like the notebook view,

203
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:19,380
Trevor Manz: those aren't more custom elements

204
00:12:19,510 --> 00:12:20,620
Trevor Manz: that we've created at Marimo

205
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:22,680
Trevor Manz: that aren't necessarily based on AnyWidget.

206
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:23,520
Michael Kennedy: Mm-hmm.

207
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:25,020
Michael Kennedy: Yeah.

208
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:26,740
Michael Kennedy: So why Marimo?

209
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:29,140
Michael Kennedy: I know I had actually a lot of people talked about

210
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:29,960
Michael Kennedy: when I look at this,

211
00:12:30,050 --> 00:12:32,760
Michael Kennedy: it feels like a super modern UI

212
00:12:32,780 --> 00:12:41,040
Michael Kennedy: that it's just, it's got a lot of polish and a lot of, you know, it feels 2025 and working with it,

213
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:47,340
Michael Kennedy: right? And it solves some of the, you know, I consider Jupyter Notebooks like the world's

214
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:52,740
Michael Kennedy: most insane, not the world's most insane, second, the second most insane, like series of go-to

215
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:56,940
Michael Kennedy: statements that have no record of how you got the go-to, you know, it doesn't even say go to 10.

216
00:12:57,080 --> 00:13:00,900
Michael Kennedy: It's like, well, what did you go and run? I don't know. Like, look at the numbers, but there's like

217
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:06,480
Michael Kennedy: potentially, you know, some lost as you rerun them. And it solves that problem as well. But like,

218
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:12,900
Trevor Manz: you know, what's the elevator pitch for Marimo? Yeah, my elevator pitch for Marimo is that I think

219
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:19,060
Trevor Manz: notebooks are incredibly important. And that it's hard to deny that like, they're a tool that many

220
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:24,520
Trevor Manz: folks use to do their daily work. But there are very few like guardrails to like help you do that

221
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:29,320
Trevor Manz: work and work on a team with other folks. And so one, like, I think one of the big selling points

222
00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:34,520
Trevor Manz: to me with marimo is just that um you sort of get to free yourself from thinking about those go-to

223
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:40,040
Trevor Manz: statements and instead you have this very like um deterministic execution that sort of just feels

224
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:46,460
Trevor Manz: like natural like as you write cells they will re-execute um and then on top of that i think that

225
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:51,420
Trevor Manz: jupiter and marimo have like slightly different goals so jupiter like when i showed that diagram

226
00:13:51,490 --> 00:13:56,340
Trevor Manz: we had that diagram before you have this split between these like diversity of front ends so

227
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:59,940
Trevor Manz: So that's like, you could use it in Colab, you could use a Jupyter kernel inside of VS Code,

228
00:14:00,010 --> 00:14:03,460
Trevor Manz: you could use a Jupyter kernel sort of within the Jupyter CLI.

229
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:08,520
Trevor Manz: But then there's all another requirement of that ecosystem is to support many different kernels.

230
00:14:08,610 --> 00:14:11,900
Trevor Manz: So it's not just Python, it could be an R kernel, it could be a Julia kernel.

231
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:17,320
Trevor Manz: And so I think ultimately attention that ends up happening is like a priority of that ecosystem

232
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:19,900
Trevor Manz: is to support all these languages and all these different front ends.

233
00:14:19,990 --> 00:14:25,540
Trevor Manz: And instead, by just focusing on Python, we can like really try to develop like a really integrated

234
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:28,760
Trevor Manz: and rich experience specifically for Python notebooks.

235
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:31,740
Trevor Manz: So the trade-off there being some folks come and they say,

236
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:33,340
Trevor Manz: oh, we'd love Marimo, but for R.

237
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:35,500
Trevor Manz: And we're like, well, we can't really do that.

238
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:37,060
Michael Kennedy: It's called Jupyter Lab.

239
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:39,840
Trevor Manz: But we are hyper-focused on Python,

240
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:42,940
Trevor Manz: and that lets us integrate with other trends within the ecosystem too.

241
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:45,900
Trevor Manz: So we're a huge fan of all the work from the Astral folks.

242
00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:49,260
Trevor Manz: And we have a tight integration with uv, for example,

243
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:53,520
Trevor Manz: to allow you to use that PEP 723 script metadata.

244
00:14:54,140 --> 00:15:05,460
Trevor Manz: And as you're working, we'll install packages for you and write that metadata so that at the end, you can send that document to someone else and they can bootstrap their notebook and get all their dependencies and have their environment set up.

245
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:13,160
Trevor Manz: I think that type of last mile with these notebooks is something that's been hard to get at without really focusing on an ecosystem.

246
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,900
Michael Kennedy: That last mile, though, that's a lot of polish.

247
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:23,100
Michael Kennedy: And that's often what kind of gets lost in projects where, I don't know.

248
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:26,120
Michael Kennedy: It's not exactly the focus, right?

249
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:29,840
Michael Kennedy: It's something where you want to take on the most interesting features,

250
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:33,620
Michael Kennedy: and it's not like it's necessarily a company,

251
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:34,600
Michael Kennedy: and there's somebody who's like,

252
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:37,480
Michael Kennedy: no, we're polishing every little rough edge, period.

253
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:38,300
Michael Kennedy: You know what I mean?

254
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:40,540
Michael Kennedy: And I think you mentioned Astral and uv.

255
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:44,360
Michael Kennedy: I think that is an example of they got funding,

256
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:47,380
Michael Kennedy: and it's like, okay, we're not going to do 95% of the packaging.

257
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:49,940
Michael Kennedy: We're going to do 99.9% of the packaging.

258
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:50,460
Michael Kennedy: You know what I mean?

259
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:52,380
Michael Kennedy: And it's made a tremendous difference.

260
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:53,400
Trevor Manz: Yeah.

261
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:56,700
Trevor Manz: Yeah, I mean, I have plenty to say about Astro.

262
00:15:56,710 --> 00:15:58,700
Trevor Manz: We love all their tooling over here too.

263
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:00,180
Michael Kennedy: Yeah, so do I.

264
00:16:00,350 --> 00:16:04,100
Michael Kennedy: I switched all my stuff to Astro and it's to uv and rough and yeah.

265
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,480
Michael Kennedy: Super, super neat.

266
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:15,680
Michael Kennedy: Okay, so another thing that you all just released is a new VS Code plugin.

267
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:22,240
Michael Kennedy: So I guess one of the aspects of Marimo that is not necessarily apparent from looking at it going there

268
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:25,320
Michael Kennedy: is that it's backed by a Python file,

269
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:28,300
Michael Kennedy: not a JSON file that contains both the inputs and outputs,

270
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:31,540
Michael Kennedy: which is one of the big shortcomings of Jupyter.

271
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:33,760
Michael Kennedy: How much of Jupyter would have benefited

272
00:16:33,830 --> 00:16:35,760
Michael Kennedy: if it just had an input and an output file?

273
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:39,120
Michael Kennedy: So you don't check in the output file, potentially.

274
00:16:39,310 --> 00:16:39,740
Michael Kennedy: You know what I mean?

275
00:16:40,430 --> 00:16:40,980
Trevor Manz: Yeah, yeah.

276
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:43,480
Trevor Manz: I think that was pretty visionary,

277
00:16:43,710 --> 00:16:47,840
Trevor Manz: or maybe it's more that we have this ability

278
00:16:47,890 --> 00:16:50,520
Trevor Manz: to observe what's happened in the Jupyter ecosystem

279
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:51,820
Trevor Manz: and make adjustments from there.

280
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:54,040
Michael Kennedy: A little bit of a second mover benefit of like, we saw that.

281
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:55,100
Michael Kennedy: That was 80% good.

282
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:56,420
Trevor Manz: Definitely.

283
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:57,880
Trevor Manz: Yeah, it was surprising.

284
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:01,340
Trevor Manz: I mean, I think to rip more on Marimo,

285
00:17:02,579 --> 00:17:04,560
Trevor Manz: when people ask that question of like, why Marimo?

286
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:06,300
Trevor Manz: I think there are all these very small things,

287
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,680
Trevor Manz: but that in net, I think,

288
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:11,740
Trevor Manz: are certainly like an order of magnitude

289
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:13,780
Trevor Manz: kind of like richer experience for our users.

290
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:17,520
Trevor Manz: But it's funny how many times just the fact

291
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:19,160
Trevor Manz: that our notebooks are get-diffable,

292
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:21,020
Trevor Manz: that's one of the first things

293
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:23,540
Trevor Manz: that folks really latch onto and love about Marimo notebooks.

294
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:25,420
Michael Kennedy: Yeah, very cool.

295
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:31,300
Michael Kennedy: So the VS Code extension, how does this help us?

296
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:37,340
Trevor Manz: Yeah, so I think the best experience with using Marimo

297
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:41,120
Trevor Manz: will always be sort of our CLI or our web interface

298
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:43,360
Trevor Manz: that we've really curated around this experience.

299
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:47,520
Trevor Manz: But we have a broad range of users that want to collaborate

300
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:48,840
Trevor Manz: or work on Marimo documents.

301
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:57,600
Trevor Manz: And so some of them are like, you know, I live in my VS Code, my cursor, my Windsurf, my IDE, and like I never want to leave this environment.

302
00:17:57,900 --> 00:18:02,180
Trevor Manz: And so getting them to come and like collaborate on these documents has been a little bit of a barrier there.

303
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:10,620
Trevor Manz: So they could, of course, edit a Python file on disk, but having like a native notebook view like they do for Jupyter was something that we sort of lacked in those environments.

304
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:19,820
Trevor Manz: And so we made it a priority shortly after I joined the team where we really wanted to address that user base of folks that want to live in that editor environment.

305
00:18:20,530 --> 00:18:30,740
Trevor Manz: And sort of from the ground up wrote this new extension where we have a very integrated view with sort of reactive outputs, similarly to what we have in our user interface.

306
00:18:30,970 --> 00:18:35,620
Trevor Manz: But it sort of lives inside of the VS Code ecosystem and uses the VS Code APIs.

307
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,100
Michael Kennedy: Yeah, that makes a lot of sense.

308
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:40,260
Michael Kennedy: and it's available on the, what is it,

309
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:45,240
Michael Kennedy: VSX Open Marketplace for like cursor and anti-gravity.

310
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:47,000
Michael Kennedy: That's a thing as of like three days ago.

311
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:50,060
Trevor Manz: Yes, all these different skins of VS Code,

312
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:53,940
Trevor Manz: our extension should work as well

313
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:55,560
Trevor Manz: and we publish it to both marketplaces

314
00:18:55,820 --> 00:18:57,760
Trevor Manz: so folks should be able to install it and get started.

315
00:18:58,200 --> 00:18:59,280
Michael Kennedy: It's a weird time for editors.

316
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:00,360
Michael Kennedy: Yes.

317
00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:02,220
Michael Kennedy: It was really kind of straight.

318
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:04,840
Michael Kennedy: When I first started Talk Python 11 years ago

319
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:05,580
Michael Kennedy: or whatever it was,

320
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:09,160
Michael Kennedy: I would ask people what editor they use at the end of the show

321
00:19:09,270 --> 00:19:11,940
Michael Kennedy: because I didn't know what they were going to say.

322
00:19:11,990 --> 00:19:12,860
Michael Kennedy: It could have been anything.

323
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:15,880
Michael Kennedy: And then it just narrowed down to VS Code, PyCharm.

324
00:19:16,330 --> 00:19:16,940
Michael Kennedy: Those were the answers.

325
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:22,140
Michael Kennedy: And now it's kind of back to a lot of options again.

326
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:26,260
Michael Kennedy: But it generally works in the VS Code variants as well.

327
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:26,940
Trevor Manz: Yeah.

328
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:29,380
Michael Kennedy: All right.

329
00:19:29,690 --> 00:19:30,000
Michael Kennedy: Super cool.

330
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:31,740
Michael Kennedy: Okay.

331
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:35,520
Michael Kennedy: Let's talk about just what is a Jupyter widget.

332
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:42,100
Trevor Manz: Yeah, so like I mentioned before, Jupyter really reaches, and Marimo also, reach across

333
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:46,640
Trevor Manz: this chasm between your Python code that's running in some, we call it a kernel environment.

334
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:50,120
Trevor Manz: That's a stateful environment that has your variables, and when you run cells, things

335
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:50,800
Trevor Manz: update there.

336
00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:56,460
Trevor Manz: And then on the front end, there's the cell outputs that are a reflection of whatever

337
00:19:56,510 --> 00:19:57,860
Trevor Manz: is sort of living in the kernel.

338
00:19:58,660 --> 00:20:05,380
Trevor Manz: And a Jupyter widget is a very interesting part of that crossing of that chasm.

339
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:08,120
Trevor Manz: in that you can actually author both the front-end code

340
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:10,000
Trevor Manz: and the back-end code to talk to one another.

341
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:13,020
Trevor Manz: So typically, it's like if you write a Python library,

342
00:20:13,030 --> 00:20:14,840
Trevor Manz: you're only writing something that runs on the server.

343
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:17,680
Trevor Manz: And then if you're making a Jupyter extension, for example,

344
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,440
Trevor Manz: that's something that only lives in the front-end.

345
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:23,500
Trevor Manz: But a widget allows a library author to connect those two worlds together.

346
00:20:23,890 --> 00:20:28,140
Trevor Manz: And so for your small object that lives in the Python kernel,

347
00:20:28,230 --> 00:20:30,500
Trevor Manz: you can define ways that it can render itself

348
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:33,040
Trevor Manz: and also be updated from that front-end.

349
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:38,340
Trevor Manz: And so it's a very powerful mechanism that's officially a part of Jupyter that allows you

350
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:43,360
Trevor Manz: to sort of like extend your output cells with, I like to think of it as these like web-based

351
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:46,560
Trevor Manz: superpowers to be able to like update your code in the kernel.

352
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:55,080
Michael Kennedy: You have a really interesting point that you made in your SciPy talk saying, basically,

353
00:20:56,180 --> 00:21:06,640
Michael Kennedy: We can do lots of UI stuff in notebooks, but often those are kind of like isolated snapshots, right?

354
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:12,040
Michael Kennedy: Maybe you have a graph and there's like outliers or something along those lines.

355
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:20,100
Michael Kennedy: But you can see them, but you can't like programmatically interact with them in the way that you could a widget.

356
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:24,080
Michael Kennedy: whereas you might drag and select to get a zoom area

357
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:26,320
Michael Kennedy: that actually becomes a data frame

358
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:30,540
Michael Kennedy: or you could move some widgets that then redraw the picture

359
00:21:30,610 --> 00:21:33,660
Michael Kennedy: but also becomes something you could program against

360
00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:35,700
Michael Kennedy: in like a machine learning algorithm or whatever, right?

361
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:39,360
Michael Kennedy: Maybe I think that's a pretty powerful distinction

362
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:42,320
Michael Kennedy: that people want to have in mind as we dive into any widget.

363
00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:43,460
Trevor Manz: Yeah, definitely.

364
00:21:44,110 --> 00:21:46,160
Trevor Manz: I like to think of it as like in a traditional

365
00:21:46,330 --> 00:21:47,660
Trevor Manz: like REPL kind of environment,

366
00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:51,800
Trevor Manz: your two modes of input are writing code and running cells.

367
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:54,240
Trevor Manz: You can write the code and you can run the cell

368
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:55,380
Trevor Manz: and then you can observe the output.

369
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:58,620
Trevor Manz: But in order to act on something that you see in that output

370
00:21:58,730 --> 00:21:59,760
Trevor Manz: you have to write more code.

371
00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:02,860
Trevor Manz: If you have a plot, for example,

372
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:04,760
Trevor Manz: that you produce from one of those outputs,

373
00:22:05,380 --> 00:22:06,420
Trevor Manz: if there's some outliers or something,

374
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:09,140
Trevor Manz: a very natural thing to think is what is that point

375
00:22:09,410 --> 00:22:10,900
Trevor Manz: and you want to circle that point.

376
00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:13,060
Trevor Manz: That is much easier to do with a gesture

377
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:16,259
Trevor Manz: than it is to express as some sort of query

378
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:18,880
Trevor Manz: in typing out some program

379
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:21,080
Michael Kennedy: and kind of looking at the axes to say,

380
00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:22,200
Trevor Manz: what are those points there?

381
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:26,900
Trevor Manz: And so I think widgets really allow for you to be creative

382
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:29,740
Trevor Manz: in terms of how you might,

383
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:32,160
Trevor Manz: like another mode of input

384
00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:34,160
Trevor Manz: for adjusting things that might be in the kernel.

385
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:35,000
Trevor Manz: And like you were saying,

386
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:36,800
Trevor Manz: now you can transform a selection

387
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:38,640
Trevor Manz: into just a data frame that you get out

388
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:40,560
Trevor Manz: and then you're off to the races

389
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:42,020
Trevor Manz: with running the next part of your program.

390
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:44,659
Trevor Manz: And so I think it adds this degree of freedom

391
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:48,980
Trevor Manz: to let the algorithms and data use code when that's useful.

392
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:51,620
Trevor Manz: And then for those pieces where you want to step in as a human

393
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:55,680
Trevor Manz: and maybe use a gesture and that's easier to express as a gesture,

394
00:22:55,980 --> 00:23:00,280
Trevor Manz: then we have that mechanism now to allow you to extend your analyses.

395
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:01,160
Michael Kennedy: Right.

396
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:03,800
Michael Kennedy: If you don't need pictures and interaction,

397
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:05,840
Michael Kennedy: just do it in Python straight.

398
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:06,860
Michael Kennedy: You know what I mean?

399
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:08,600
Michael Kennedy: You don't need notebooks.

400
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:14,079
Michael Kennedy: And part of the value of notebooks is this mix of a visual plus

401
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:18,800
Michael Kennedy: code plus visual and the sort of iterative back and forth between those.

402
00:23:19,780 --> 00:23:25,260
Michael Kennedy: And widgets reconnect the visual back to the code, I guess, right?

403
00:23:25,620 --> 00:23:26,260
Trevor Manz: Yeah, exactly.

404
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:28,540
Trevor Manz: I like to think of it as like notebooks are,

405
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:31,920
Trevor Manz: like the types of workflows in notebooks are not typically like batch scripts.

406
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:35,340
Trevor Manz: I mean, in Marimo, you can write your notebook and run it as a script,

407
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:36,760
Trevor Manz: but like because it's just Python.

408
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:40,820
Trevor Manz: But often when people are working and like really getting their hands on data,

409
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:47,120
Trevor Manz: These are like long-lived sessions where you have a lot of data in memory and you really want to get your hands on that data.

410
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:55,540
Trevor Manz: And I think if you only had the ability to like kind of write and run cells and not sort of add that extra dimension, like it'd be pretty limited to what you could actually do.

411
00:23:55,760 --> 00:24:06,680
Trevor Manz: And so something like widgets allows you to really extend and be creative with how you'd like to like explore that data and sort of like debug your data as it's in memory and get your hands on it.

412
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:07,500
Michael Kennedy: Yeah.

413
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:11,940
Michael Kennedy: Yeah, I mean, that's what blew the world open when all that came around, right?

414
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:12,540
Michael Kennedy: Yeah.

415
00:24:12,740 --> 00:24:17,180
Michael Kennedy: So that brings us to AnyWidget.

416
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:19,780
Michael Kennedy: Why a new widget framework?

417
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:23,740
Michael Kennedy: Why not just IPy widgets or whatever the...

418
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:25,820
Trevor Manz: Yeah, it's a great question.

419
00:24:26,090 --> 00:24:31,200
Trevor Manz: And it's something that when I started my PhD, like I was not, I guess I didn't really have a hand on either.

420
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:38,160
Trevor Manz: But AnyWidget was definitely born out of a need of myself to solve a problem that I was running into during the PhD.

421
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:42,300
Trevor Manz: So as I mentioned before, we had all these visualization tools that we were building.

422
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:48,480
Trevor Manz: And specifically, one of the tools I was building was a web-based genome browser.

423
00:24:48,730 --> 00:24:51,880
Trevor Manz: And so this is something that people put their genomes into.

424
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:53,600
Trevor Manz: And you can align different tracks.

425
00:24:53,650 --> 00:24:59,020
Trevor Manz: And you can zoom in and try to understand different types of functional assays and genomics.

426
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:03,040
Trevor Manz: And then we had users that wanted to use these inside of computational notebooks.

427
00:25:03,580 --> 00:25:06,420
Trevor Manz: and that one thing that immediately happened

428
00:25:06,730 --> 00:25:08,600
Trevor Manz: when we tried to build these integrations for notebooks

429
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:10,740
Trevor Manz: is that you'd spend all this engineering effort

430
00:25:10,970 --> 00:25:13,600
Trevor Manz: trying to build an integration for a specific notebook

431
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:16,600
Trevor Manz: but then like someone would come in and say

432
00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:18,560
Trevor Manz: oh I'd actually want this to work in Google Colab

433
00:25:18,650 --> 00:25:20,020
Trevor Manz: or I need this to work in VS Code

434
00:25:20,110 --> 00:25:22,380
Trevor Manz: or I need this to work in this other environment

435
00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:27,460
Trevor Manz: and that's sort of all of those environments

436
00:25:27,530 --> 00:25:29,000
Trevor Manz: are very similar on the back end side

437
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:30,580
Trevor Manz: but they're very different on the front end

438
00:25:30,630 --> 00:25:32,299
Trevor Manz: in terms of the way that you can register

439
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:33,580
Trevor Manz: like front-end code.

440
00:25:33,620 --> 00:25:36,520
Trevor Manz: And so I ended up putting a lot on a library author

441
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:38,460
Trevor Manz: like myself to try to build those adapters

442
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:39,640
Trevor Manz: for each of those environments.

443
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:43,620
Trevor Manz: And so any widget was sort of an attempt to standardize

444
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:45,780
Trevor Manz: maybe how we can write that front-end code

445
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:47,500
Trevor Manz: such that it's more,

446
00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:49,720
Trevor Manz: and then we can build those adapters in one place

447
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:52,060
Trevor Manz: that then we can support all those different environments.

448
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:52,740
Michael Kennedy: Right, right.

449
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:53,960
Michael Kennedy: We talked about building the widgets

450
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:56,080
Michael Kennedy: largely in JavaScript earlier already,

451
00:25:57,820 --> 00:26:00,959
Michael Kennedy: but I think what people maybe who haven't tried this

452
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:08,380
Michael Kennedy: don't realize is how many variations you would have to build to say have I also I wanted to work

453
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:14,380
Michael Kennedy: in Jupyter and I wanted to work in Colab and you've got to build and publish the PyPI and NPM

454
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:22,060
Michael Kennedy: and right there's like so everyone who built one of those had and wanted to cross use they had to

455
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:27,519
Michael Kennedy: do all those adaptation adaptation so and your thought was basically well I could create an

456
00:26:27,540 --> 00:26:31,040
Michael Kennedy: adapter that everyone could use and that we don't have to do this ever again.

457
00:26:31,660 --> 00:26:35,060
Trevor Manz: Yeah, exactly. And to what you're saying as well, I think

458
00:26:37,780 --> 00:26:39,380
Trevor Manz: that adapter craziness

459
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:43,060
Trevor Manz: that's in the web ecosystem of like, oh my gosh, I had to

460
00:26:44,740 --> 00:26:47,540
Trevor Manz: transpile my code into all these different formats. It's kind of a nightmare

461
00:26:47,710 --> 00:26:51,440
Trevor Manz: in terms of tooling. And it's something that came as a result of

462
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:54,759
Trevor Manz: the state of the JavaScript ecosystem being pretty immature

463
00:26:56,060 --> 00:26:56,500
Trevor Manz: 2018.

464
00:26:58,210 --> 00:27:02,420
Trevor Manz: And then we, and basically because JavaScript didn't have like a module system.

465
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:05,460
Trevor Manz: And so everyone had to come up with a way to like bundle code.

466
00:27:05,620 --> 00:27:07,380
Trevor Manz: And there are all these third party adapters.

467
00:27:07,410 --> 00:27:10,640
Trevor Manz: They're figuring out a way that they could like load JavaScript modules.

468
00:27:11,060 --> 00:27:15,420
Trevor Manz: And so whatever these tools chose in the way that they chose their front, to load their

469
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:18,880
Trevor Manz: front end code would affect like the way that me as the library author would need to like

470
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:19,780
Trevor Manz: package up the code.

471
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:24,140
Michael Kennedy: By modules and loading, you're talking where people might see the word require.

472
00:27:24,460 --> 00:27:26,740
Michael Kennedy: a thing at the top or something like that.

473
00:27:26,790 --> 00:27:27,660
Michael Kennedy: Kind of like our import.

474
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:30,760
Trevor Manz: Yes, exactly. It's very much like import statements

475
00:27:30,910 --> 00:27:32,160
Trevor Manz: in Python. And in fact,

476
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:34,440
Trevor Manz: if you open up your browser,

477
00:27:34,490 --> 00:27:36,760
Trevor Manz: you can use a syntax

478
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:38,800
Trevor Manz: that's called ES modules

479
00:27:39,110 --> 00:27:40,480
Trevor Manz: and type in import.

480
00:27:41,060 --> 00:27:42,960
Trevor Manz: And you can import a bit

481
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:44,480
Trevor Manz: of JavaScript code via URL.

482
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:47,160
Trevor Manz: And this just works natively

483
00:27:47,270 --> 00:27:48,640
Trevor Manz: in the browsers today.

484
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:51,120
Trevor Manz: But it wasn't standardized

485
00:27:51,330 --> 00:27:52,200
Trevor Manz: until late 2015.

486
00:27:53,010 --> 00:27:53,760
Trevor Manz: Or late 2018.

487
00:27:54,180 --> 00:27:58,140
Trevor Manz: So you mentioned require, that's actually a different module system.

488
00:27:58,220 --> 00:28:00,040
Trevor Manz: That's not based in browsers.

489
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:02,900
Trevor Manz: And if you were to type require in your browser, that would not work.

490
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:05,960
Trevor Manz: And that is sort of like the tension that was the JavaScript ecosystem.

491
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:09,860
Trevor Manz: So I was aware of some of the trends and things that have happened

492
00:28:10,540 --> 00:28:13,440
Trevor Manz: post this new module system because I'd been working in the web ecosystem.

493
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:16,300
Trevor Manz: And yet when I came to work on like Jupyter widgets specifically,

494
00:28:17,260 --> 00:28:21,720
Trevor Manz: I felt like I was writing code like I had been a while ago for the browser.

495
00:28:22,180 --> 00:28:24,120
Trevor Manz: And so the idea behind any widget was to like,

496
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:26,660
Trevor Manz: let's just simplify this so like that my source

497
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:28,040
Trevor Manz: and the code that I publish

498
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:30,800
Trevor Manz: is more like what the browser understands natively.

499
00:28:31,170 --> 00:28:33,300
Trevor Manz: And then we take care of this like transpilation stuff

500
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:38,000
Trevor Manz: once for everybody and package that up inside of any widget

501
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:40,500
Trevor Manz: to deal with sort of like the legacy module systems

502
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:44,160
Trevor Manz: of like JupyterLab, VS Code and a Google collab.

503
00:28:45,060 --> 00:28:45,120
Michael Kennedy: - Yeah.

504
00:28:47,140 --> 00:28:50,060
Michael Kennedy: Trying to decide if I feel like it's in the interest,

505
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:54,540
Michael Kennedy: If the motivation of any of those platforms would have been to create something like this,

506
00:28:55,540 --> 00:28:55,640
Michael Kennedy: right?

507
00:28:55,860 --> 00:28:57,840
Michael Kennedy: Like the Jupyter people are like, I don't know the problem.

508
00:28:57,840 --> 00:28:59,120
Michael Kennedy: You just write for Jupyter and it works.

509
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:02,060
Michael Kennedy: And the CoLab people are like, I don't see a problem.

510
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:03,760
Michael Kennedy: You just write for CoLab and it works, right?

511
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:11,380
Michael Kennedy: What is the platform people's motivation to create integrations and smooth the transition

512
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:12,240
Michael Kennedy: to the other ones?

513
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:13,880
Michael Kennedy: That's one tension.

514
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:17,920
Michael Kennedy: On the other, though, they might have more stuff come to them if they make it more reusable

515
00:29:18,140 --> 00:29:18,820
Michael Kennedy: across them, right?

516
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:20,980
Michael Kennedy: So it's interesting that none of them actually did that.

517
00:29:21,340 --> 00:29:26,320
Trevor Manz: Yeah, I think, I mean, in hindsight, it makes sense why someone in my position, like, I guess,

518
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:30,920
Trevor Manz: focused on this because it was like, I had two widgets and then times the number of platforms.

519
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:33,840
Trevor Manz: And then if something broke, you'd have to go fix it a bunch of different places.

520
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:36,500
Trevor Manz: And like, it just becomes a maintenance nightmare.

521
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:43,020
Trevor Manz: But one thing that's been really interesting is I think that there is a good pressure to like,

522
00:29:43,580 --> 00:29:45,580
Trevor Manz: support like a healthy ecosystem.

523
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:51,360
Trevor Manz: So I'd say before any widget, it was pretty complicated to create custom widgets.

524
00:29:51,640 --> 00:30:01,380
Trevor Manz: And so one of my goals was I want the feeling of being able to author a widget to be very similar to the way that you can copy and paste code into a notebook, but move it into a file.

525
00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:03,180
Trevor Manz: And then you could publish that to PyPI.

526
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:05,520
Trevor Manz: And that workflow always worked for Python.

527
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:11,500
Trevor Manz: But there was no way to start prototyping a widget inside of a notebook before and then move it out.

528
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:14,780
Trevor Manz: And I really wanted to bring sort of to lower that barrier to entry.

529
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:19,600
Trevor Manz: And then what I think came out of that is you get a much richer ecosystem

530
00:30:19,690 --> 00:30:22,520
Trevor Manz: of people that are willing to try and make things.

531
00:30:23,260 --> 00:30:25,380
Trevor Manz: And then when there's a cool widget that comes out,

532
00:30:25,470 --> 00:30:27,920
Trevor Manz: then that's a good positive pressure for other ecosystems

533
00:30:28,150 --> 00:30:29,440
Trevor Manz: because then people are trying to request.

534
00:30:29,450 --> 00:30:31,860
Trevor Manz: They go, hey, I want this widget to work in your environment.

535
00:30:31,990 --> 00:30:34,520
Trevor Manz: And that puts more pressure on various environments

536
00:30:34,820 --> 00:30:37,260
Trevor Manz: to implement sort of a more standardized approach.

537
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:40,840
Michael Kennedy: Or adopt an adapting layer like any widget.

538
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:42,140
Michael Kennedy: Yep, yeah, exactly.

539
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:44,240
Michael Kennedy: Yeah, to sort of back you up here,

540
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:47,600
Michael Kennedy: Kostal says, "Thank you for building any widget.

541
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:49,740
Michael Kennedy: Having gone through creating an IPy widget,

542
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:51,040
Michael Kennedy: it was a lot of work."

543
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:53,040
Michael Kennedy: So yeah, exactly.

544
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:54,700
Michael Kennedy: Exactly.

545
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:00,640
Michael Kennedy: Let's just take a tour through the widget gallery.

546
00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:03,200
Michael Kennedy: What widgets are available here?

547
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:06,460
Michael Kennedy: Got some favorites?

548
00:31:06,820 --> 00:31:08,240
Trevor Manz: Yeah, we definitely have some favorites.

549
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:12,360
Trevor Manz: I would say that one of the early adopters of AnyWidget

550
00:31:12,460 --> 00:31:14,680
Trevor Manz: is a fairly popular plotting library called Altair.

551
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:19,960
Trevor Manz: And it allows to do exactly what you were talking about earlier

552
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:23,600
Trevor Manz: with selecting points and allowing you to get those back

553
00:31:23,620 --> 00:31:24,880
Trevor Manz: as data frames in the kernel.

554
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:27,260
Trevor Manz: So for a while, the way that Altair worked,

555
00:31:27,860 --> 00:31:34,580
Trevor Manz: and I think it still by default works inside of a Jupyter environment,

556
00:31:34,660 --> 00:31:36,980
Trevor Manz: is that it creates sort of an interactive output

557
00:31:37,220 --> 00:31:38,640
Trevor Manz: that isn't connected back to the kernel.

558
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:47,020
Michael Kennedy: It feels interactive because you can zoom in and you can select and you can do all the things, but it's just a view.

559
00:31:47,670 --> 00:31:52,660
Trevor Manz: Exactly. That state, I like to think of it as trapped in the output and you can't get it back in the notebook.

560
00:31:52,950 --> 00:32:00,020
Trevor Manz: And so what the AnyWidget does behind the scenes is it allows for that output to communicate back with the kernel,

561
00:32:00,470 --> 00:32:06,640
Trevor Manz: which then allows you to update an object or a selection and then run your cell again and view some output.

562
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:15,780
Trevor Manz: And just that bi-directional communication between your kernel and your front end allows you to do things like create a data frame that is updated when you select.

563
00:32:17,740 --> 00:32:17,820
Michael Kennedy: Yeah.

564
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:18,640
Michael Kennedy: Nice.

565
00:32:19,380 --> 00:32:23,220
Michael Kennedy: Yeah, it's sort of that example we talked about, the outliers before, right?

566
00:32:23,740 --> 00:32:24,260
Trevor Manz: Yeah, exactly.

567
00:32:27,940 --> 00:32:29,120
Michael Kennedy: Altair's super cool.

568
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:32,760
Michael Kennedy: I talked to Jake Vanderplass about it when it first came out.

569
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:34,860
Michael Kennedy: And it's very beautiful.

570
00:32:35,900 --> 00:32:40,340
Trevor Manz: Yeah, Altair was actually, I think, how I got into open source contributions forever

571
00:32:40,470 --> 00:32:40,580
Trevor Manz: ago.

572
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:47,499
Trevor Manz: I made documentation examples, and it was very fun to come full circle to actually have a

573
00:32:48,220 --> 00:32:51,360
Trevor Manz: dependency that somehow got back into that library many years later.

574
00:32:51,820 --> 00:32:58,060
Michael Kennedy: Yeah, now you built something that supercharges Altair because now it has bidirectional data

575
00:32:58,260 --> 00:32:59,860
Michael Kennedy: integration sort of thing.

576
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:01,060
Michael Kennedy: Yeah, that's wild.

577
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:03,780
Michael Kennedy: Maybe just talk to people really quick about that.

578
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:09,120
Michael Kennedy: You don't have to write a revolutionary feature to be part of open source.

579
00:33:10,340 --> 00:33:11,600
Trevor Manz: Yeah, definitely.

580
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:17,600
Trevor Manz: I think my entry to open source was just I got interested in a plotting library,

581
00:33:17,940 --> 00:33:21,220
Trevor Manz: and they had some open tickets for making examples for their documentation.

582
00:33:21,820 --> 00:33:24,060
Trevor Manz: And I wanted to learn how to use the plotting library,

583
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:25,920
Trevor Manz: so then I started contributing to them.

584
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:28,820
Trevor Manz: And it was really like those interactions, I think, with maintainers

585
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:31,760
Trevor Manz: that kind of got a tick in my head where I was like,

586
00:33:31,820 --> 00:33:35,280
Trevor Manz: oh, I think I like this way of working and communicate.

587
00:33:35,380 --> 00:33:37,880
Trevor Manz: Like there's a lot of, I don't know,

588
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:39,520
Trevor Manz: oftentimes the challenges in open source

589
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:41,460
Trevor Manz: aren't so technical as they are just social

590
00:33:41,660 --> 00:33:43,720
Trevor Manz: and figuring out how to communicate expectations

591
00:33:44,140 --> 00:33:44,940
Trevor Manz: to different users.

592
00:33:45,140 --> 00:33:47,380
Trevor Manz: And I think specifically interacting

593
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:49,460
Trevor Manz: with Jake Vander Plaas in some of those issues,

594
00:33:49,540 --> 00:33:53,080
Trevor Manz: I think I learned a lot about that

595
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:55,920
Trevor Manz: and I was attracted to trying to find new ways

596
00:33:56,140 --> 00:33:58,480
Trevor Manz: to work on problems in open source.

597
00:33:59,200 --> 00:33:59,920
Michael Kennedy: Yeah, awesome.

598
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:01,640
Michael Kennedy: All right.

599
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:05,580
Michael Kennedy: Well, that's number one with 10,000 favorites out of the community.

600
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:07,660
Michael Kennedy: What are some others?

601
00:34:08,179 --> 00:34:12,679
Trevor Manz: Some of the other, I would say like, so Vincent Womerdam, who is one of my colleagues and

602
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:14,879
Trevor Manz: you've had it on the podcast many times before.

603
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:15,620
Michael Kennedy: A couple of times, yeah.

604
00:34:15,879 --> 00:34:18,179
Trevor Manz: Yeah, has created this draw data widget.

605
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:25,040
Trevor Manz: And I would say when this widget came out, this was very much, it demos very well.

606
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:29,399
Trevor Manz: So the idea is that you have like a canvas that you can draw some points and you get

607
00:34:29,419 --> 00:34:31,060
Trevor Manz: those points back out as a data frame.

608
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:35,919
Trevor Manz: And yes, so Vincent has a nice Marimo notebook

609
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:37,879
Trevor Manz: that's running in the browser, I think.

610
00:34:38,260 --> 00:34:38,879
Michael Kennedy: - Yeah, that's right.

611
00:34:39,060 --> 00:34:39,639
Michael Kennedy: - There we go.

612
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:42,220
Trevor Manz: And I believe if you draw some points.

613
00:34:42,740 --> 00:34:43,260
Michael Kennedy: - I don't like the brush.

614
00:34:43,419 --> 00:34:44,159
Michael Kennedy: I'm gonna change the brush side.

615
00:34:44,620 --> 00:34:45,639
Michael Kennedy: We've got precise data here.

616
00:34:45,740 --> 00:34:46,060
Michael Kennedy: So no.

617
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:47,820
Michael Kennedy: - I think if we go--

618
00:34:47,820 --> 00:34:49,520
Michael Kennedy: - So you could have one kind of data set here,

619
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:50,899
Michael Kennedy: and then you could go like, okay, we're gonna do,

620
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:52,960
Michael Kennedy: you know, this is super interesting

621
00:34:53,139 --> 00:34:55,980
Michael Kennedy: because maybe you say like the data kind of looks like this

622
00:34:56,020 --> 00:34:57,520
Michael Kennedy: and I wanna run an algorithm against it,

623
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:59,580
Michael Kennedy: but there's a ton of work to get the data

624
00:34:59,580 --> 00:35:00,140
Michael Kennedy: in the right format.

625
00:35:00,460 --> 00:35:06,080
Michael Kennedy: You could just start kind of just visually doing these things,

626
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:09,540
Michael Kennedy: and then you can go on and analyze it

627
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:14,160
Michael Kennedy: and do all sorts of stuff by just literally by drawing.

628
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:14,960
Trevor Manz: Yeah.

629
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:19,040
Trevor Manz: Educators are quite excited about this kind of widget

630
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:20,380
Trevor Manz: because it's like, hey, here's this.

631
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:22,820
Trevor Manz: How does a random forest algorithm work?

632
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:24,520
Trevor Manz: It's like, okay, we can just draw a data set,

633
00:35:24,530 --> 00:35:27,520
Trevor Manz: and then we can actually view how a classification would work

634
00:35:27,580 --> 00:35:29,160
Trevor Manz: over a specific type of data set.

635
00:35:29,380 --> 00:35:35,740
Trevor Manz: And I think it's really that type of interplay between something that you can play with to create something with the data.

636
00:35:35,870 --> 00:35:39,480
Trevor Manz: And then maybe you take scikit-learn or something and apply an algorithm.

637
00:35:39,940 --> 00:35:50,640
Trevor Manz: And you can help build intuition for how these algorithms work just by plugging in with the actual workhorse of doing the operations and computing your classifier.

638
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:57,260
Trevor Manz: But instead, you have this new input, which is allowing for a bit more play with learning how those algorithms work.

639
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:58,060
Trevor Manz: Yeah.

640
00:35:58,060 --> 00:35:58,540
Michael Kennedy: Yeah.

641
00:35:58,780 --> 00:36:06,880
Michael Kennedy: You're, you have an algorithm and you say, I want to see how, if the data looked like

642
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:07,840
Michael Kennedy: this, what would happen?

643
00:36:07,860 --> 00:36:09,560
Michael Kennedy: If the data looked like that, what would happen?

644
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:15,600
Michael Kennedy: And a lot of times people will result to generating that data with code, either by writing,

645
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:19,860
Michael Kennedy: writing it themselves, using a library like Faker or something like that, you know, to

646
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,260
Michael Kennedy: like, how am I going to get it?

647
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:22,580
Michael Kennedy: What if it looks like this?

648
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:26,060
Michael Kennedy: And here you just say, what if it looks like this and you draw it?

649
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:28,520
Michael Kennedy: Then you run your algorithm based on the output of it

650
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:30,680
Michael Kennedy: because it's a widget, an AnyWidget widget.

651
00:36:31,580 --> 00:36:32,840
Michael Kennedy: And then you just keep going.

652
00:36:33,020 --> 00:36:34,180
Michael Kennedy: It's super neat, actually.

653
00:36:34,980 --> 00:36:35,780
Trevor Manz: Yeah, yeah.

654
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:38,920
Trevor Manz: So to go back to, I think,

655
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:40,720
Trevor Manz: something you mentioned before as well,

656
00:36:41,260 --> 00:36:43,560
Trevor Manz: like AnyWidget sort of serves two communities.

657
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:45,140
Trevor Manz: So I think for one, there are folks

658
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:47,960
Trevor Manz: that never will ever need to touch or learn any JavaScript

659
00:36:48,100 --> 00:36:49,480
Trevor Manz: but can just use these libraries

660
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:50,940
Trevor Manz: like they would Python packages.

661
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:53,860
Trevor Manz: So the idea is, hey, I can pip install draw data

662
00:36:54,140 --> 00:36:55,279
Trevor Manz: and now I get to use a scatter widget

663
00:36:55,300 --> 00:37:00,260
Trevor Manz: it. And I don't care at all how it works, but now I get to understand how this algorithm works.

664
00:37:00,980 --> 00:37:06,080
Trevor Manz: But for those that are interested, they can go and learn maybe a little bit of JavaScript,

665
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:10,860
Trevor Manz: progressively a little bit more JavaScript, to create something and package it up for

666
00:37:11,740 --> 00:37:14,940
Trevor Manz: many different platforms. So you sort of have people that want to make libraries,

667
00:37:15,150 --> 00:37:19,560
Trevor Manz: and then you have library consumers. And depending on how much front-end stuff you want to learn,

668
00:37:19,940 --> 00:37:24,439
Trevor Manz: that's how deep you can go into either of those sides. But I'd say probably many more people are

669
00:37:24,460 --> 00:37:29,660
Trevor Manz: just widget users and happily wire them together and don't worry about it and move on with their

670
00:37:29,740 --> 00:37:34,660
Trevor Manz: day. And then there's some folks that maybe go a little bit deeper on the JS side and learn how

671
00:37:34,660 --> 00:37:39,280
Michael Kennedy: to create these interactive experiences. When you say wire them together, do you mean like put

672
00:37:39,780 --> 00:37:44,320
Michael Kennedy: one in a notebook in one cell and then another in another cell, but then say the input of it

673
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:48,620
Michael Kennedy: is the output of the other, that kind of wire together? Exactly. Yeah. So you can really think

674
00:37:48,630 --> 00:37:52,860
Trevor Manz: of these as like building blocks that you can like compose inside of a notebook environment.

675
00:37:53,320 --> 00:38:00,400
Trevor Manz: And I think specifically in Marimo, a really cool thing is that when you update that value that lives in the kernel, that cell below will rerun.

676
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:04,700
Trevor Manz: So now it's not just like you do the thing and then you have to manually rerun the cell.

677
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:13,300
Trevor Manz: You actually start to build up, based off our reactivity graph, like a little bit of an application of like I select some cells and now that reruns this Python code.

678
00:38:13,660 --> 00:38:19,020
Trevor Manz: And if I have more cells that run after that, it all is sort of wired up from this new input, which is your widget.

679
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:22,420
Michael Kennedy: Yeah, I kind of riffed on this a little bit

680
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:24,140
Michael Kennedy: when I said the world's craziest go-to.

681
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:27,340
Michael Kennedy: And I said the second craziest because the most crazy is Excel.

682
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:32,500
Michael Kennedy: But that's because the way Marimo solves that

683
00:38:32,620 --> 00:38:35,300
Michael Kennedy: is it actually understands the way these variables

684
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:36,300
Michael Kennedy: used across cells.

685
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:38,420
Michael Kennedy: So when I move a widget in one, it redraws.

686
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:40,980
Michael Kennedy: It's like, oh, the thing that depended upon it

687
00:38:41,780 --> 00:38:42,580
Michael Kennedy: also now has to change.

688
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:46,000
Michael Kennedy: And then it cascades that execution across the widgets,

689
00:38:46,220 --> 00:38:46,300
Michael Kennedy: right?

690
00:38:46,620 --> 00:38:46,900
Trevor Manz: Exactly.

691
00:38:47,380 --> 00:38:48,679
Trevor Manz: And that would normally just happen

692
00:38:48,700 --> 00:38:52,200
Trevor Manz: if you use our built-in UI elements or if you rerun cells.

693
00:38:53,030 --> 00:38:56,700
Trevor Manz: And because it's just this reactive model where we trace the dependency,

694
00:38:56,980 --> 00:39:00,040
Trevor Manz: we just track what the dependencies are statically between your cells.

695
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:03,380
Trevor Manz: We know that when you update this property on a widget,

696
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:06,140
Trevor Manz: we know it sells that you have to update that depend on that widget.

697
00:39:06,350 --> 00:39:10,200
Trevor Manz: And so, yeah, it just sort of all falls out of this simple idea

698
00:39:10,460 --> 00:39:11,800
Trevor Manz: of your notebooks are a graph.

699
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:14,880
Trevor Manz: They're not just like this manual.

700
00:39:15,860 --> 00:39:19,220
Trevor Manz: I think of it as like a lot of running cells

701
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:20,380
Trevor Manz: is like manual callbacks.

702
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:22,340
Trevor Manz: Like you do something and you're like,

703
00:39:22,380 --> 00:39:24,340
Trevor Manz: oh, I have to click a callback and run it.

704
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:27,540
Trevor Manz: And by modeling it as a graph, we can run those for you.

705
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:31,200
Trevor Manz: And so that we know exactly what needs to update

706
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:35,320
Trevor Manz: when this dependency of that part of the graph is invalidated.

707
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:38,340
Michael Kennedy: - I've talked to some data scientists who are like,

708
00:39:39,940 --> 00:39:42,400
Michael Kennedy: that is both a feature and a problem

709
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:45,300
Michael Kennedy: that you can just be so free form in Jupyter Notebooks, right?

710
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:47,440
Michael Kennedy: Like I can just iterate and play.

711
00:39:47,730 --> 00:39:51,400
Michael Kennedy: And I think while you're iterating and playing, that freedom is great.

712
00:39:51,530 --> 00:39:56,860
Michael Kennedy: But as soon as you want to start making decisions, then it becomes like a real danger point, right?

713
00:39:57,500 --> 00:39:57,600
Michael Kennedy: Yeah.

714
00:39:58,170 --> 00:39:59,920
Trevor Manz: I think there's kind of a nice balance.

715
00:40:00,180 --> 00:40:09,140
Trevor Manz: So specifically in Marimo, there are some requirements for how you have to write your Python code that are slightly more limiting than within a Jupyter environment.

716
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:14,460
Trevor Manz: And one that often trips folks up is that you can't redeclare variables across cells or else it would be ambiguous.

717
00:40:15,380 --> 00:40:19,320
Trevor Manz: Like what is this the cell that defines X or is this the cell that defines X?

718
00:40:20,540 --> 00:40:21,740
Trevor Manz: But I like to think about it.

719
00:40:21,740 --> 00:40:22,760
Michael Kennedy: Which order did you run it in?

720
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:23,280
Michael Kennedy: That's the one.

721
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:24,560
Trevor Manz: Yeah, exactly.

722
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:25,360
Michael Kennedy: That's tricky.

723
00:40:25,820 --> 00:40:27,740
Trevor Manz: So we're fairly strict on that.

724
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:32,340
Trevor Manz: But what we believe is if you buy into this like constraint, then we can give you all these properties,

725
00:40:32,660 --> 00:40:38,800
Trevor Manz: which are deterministic execution order and the ability to, you know, turn these scripts into reproducible,

726
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:43,340
Trevor Manz: or turn these sort of open-ended workflows

727
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:44,940
Trevor Manz: into more reproducible artifacts

728
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:47,640
Trevor Manz: that have a deterministic execution order.

729
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:50,480
Trevor Manz: And so I like to think of it a little bit as like,

730
00:40:50,620 --> 00:40:52,560
Trevor Manz: I used to type Python code without type hints.

731
00:40:53,100 --> 00:40:54,220
Trevor Manz: Then I started using type hints,

732
00:40:54,300 --> 00:40:56,980
Trevor Manz: and now I can't imagine not having any autocomplete.

733
00:40:57,500 --> 00:40:59,320
Trevor Manz: And now I think maybe our type,

734
00:40:59,620 --> 00:41:01,500
Trevor Manz: when you start working with data in long-lived sessions,

735
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:04,300
Trevor Manz: having some of these guardrails actually help you keep on track

736
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:06,700
Trevor Manz: such that if you accidentally delete a variable,

737
00:41:07,580 --> 00:41:09,140
Trevor Manz: we'll let you know that you deleted it.

738
00:41:09,180 --> 00:41:11,200
Trevor Manz: And it's not something that the next time you boot up the notebook,

739
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:12,420
Trevor Manz: you're just missing that variable.

740
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:14,980
Trevor Manz: So it's something that you buy into,

741
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:17,580
Trevor Manz: but then I think has all these nice consequences that come out.

742
00:41:18,460 --> 00:41:21,500
Michael Kennedy: As a newbie, you'll see like these things are not defined

743
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:22,620
Michael Kennedy: or this library doesn't exist.

744
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:23,920
Michael Kennedy: And you know what it does exist?

745
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:26,220
Michael Kennedy: You just skipped running the top import cell.

746
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:28,460
Michael Kennedy: That stuff's a little frustrating.

747
00:41:29,940 --> 00:41:33,540
Michael Kennedy: So during this talk you talked about, during your talk previously,

748
00:41:33,740 --> 00:41:38,860
Michael Kennedy: You talked about how any widget allows you to write just enough JavaScript.

749
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:41,340
Michael Kennedy: What do you mean by that?

750
00:41:41,420 --> 00:41:42,920
Trevor Manz: What do I mean by just enough JavaScript?

751
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:43,300
Michael Kennedy: Yeah.

752
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:46,240
Michael Kennedy: So one person's just enough JavaScript.

753
00:41:46,390 --> 00:41:48,580
Michael Kennedy: There's another person like, whoa, way too much JavaScript.

754
00:41:49,180 --> 00:41:49,440
Trevor Manz: Sure.

755
00:41:49,790 --> 00:41:55,380
Trevor Manz: So when I first started learning any front-end code, my experience was I opened up an HTML

756
00:41:55,720 --> 00:41:57,860
Trevor Manz: file and I just wrote some JavaScript on the page.

757
00:41:58,020 --> 00:42:05,320
Trevor Manz: And I completely love this workflow for playing and learning how to write code for the first time in the browser.

758
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:14,400
Trevor Manz: But I think over the years, as people have started to build things like Figma and Adobe in the browser,

759
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:18,580
Trevor Manz: there's a ton of tooling that has come up to help build those types of applications.

760
00:42:19,300 --> 00:42:26,580
Trevor Manz: So many people's first experience with writing JavaScript is someone telling them that they need to learn React or learn a specific framework.

761
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:30,380
Trevor Manz: And then it's a bit like, well, this isn't technically JavaScript.

762
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:32,600
Trevor Manz: This is like a flavor of JavaScript that we transform.

763
00:42:33,860 --> 00:42:42,940
Trevor Manz: And so the experience that I wanted for any widget was to write sort of this like standardized JavaScript code as sort of the entry point to your widgets.

764
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:49,320
Trevor Manz: So it should feel as simple as you could just open up the browser console and start typing in code.

765
00:42:49,740 --> 00:42:52,960
Trevor Manz: And the code that you write is exactly what the browser understands.

766
00:42:53,180 --> 00:42:55,780
Trevor Manz: And so it should be dead simple from the beginning,

767
00:42:57,040 --> 00:42:59,980
Trevor Manz: just learning some APIs and probably pattern matching

768
00:43:00,150 --> 00:43:01,820
Trevor Manz: between, okay, this is some syntax,

769
00:43:01,990 --> 00:43:03,360
Trevor Manz: but it should feel pretty familiar.

770
00:43:04,620 --> 00:43:06,100
Trevor Manz: Should you want to learn those frameworks

771
00:43:06,210 --> 00:43:06,980
Trevor Manz: or use those frameworks,

772
00:43:07,780 --> 00:43:10,000
Trevor Manz: those all have the ability to be transformed

773
00:43:10,270 --> 00:43:12,840
Trevor Manz: into this standardized JavaScript.

774
00:43:12,950 --> 00:43:15,100
Trevor Manz: And in fact, they have to be in order to run in the browser.

775
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:16,080
Michael Kennedy: That's how that all works.

776
00:43:16,660 --> 00:43:19,720
Trevor Manz: So I wanted that initial experience to be,

777
00:43:20,060 --> 00:43:22,020
Trevor Manz: if you want to learn and you've never tried it out before,

778
00:43:22,940 --> 00:43:26,980
Trevor Manz: you know, send a variable and you can console log that variable and it just works.

779
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:30,900
Trevor Manz: But should you want to build something very ambitious and like a lot of our most popular

780
00:43:31,740 --> 00:43:35,160
Trevor Manz: complicated widgets do use some of these frameworks, that's something that you can learn.

781
00:43:35,700 --> 00:43:43,460
Michael Kennedy: So I could do a view or an Alpine JS or I could do a React and all of that kind of stuff if I want.

782
00:43:43,780 --> 00:43:48,700
Trevor Manz: Yeah. So in our documentation, there is like a, I think it's, I call it, we call it,

783
00:43:49,060 --> 00:43:51,420
Trevor Manz: We have a little CLI to bootstrap a project

784
00:43:51,640 --> 00:43:53,080
Trevor Manz: that's ready to be used with React.

785
00:43:55,180 --> 00:43:59,460
Trevor Manz: I think we had a contributor contribute one for Vue and Svelte as well.

786
00:44:00,520 --> 00:44:01,960
Trevor Manz: The whole idea there is, yes,

787
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:05,920
Trevor Manz: the trade-off is that now you are introducing

788
00:44:06,270 --> 00:44:09,480
Trevor Manz: some JavaScript build tooling into this process,

789
00:44:09,900 --> 00:44:12,120
Trevor Manz: but hopefully if you're familiar with those frameworks,

790
00:44:12,280 --> 00:44:15,280
Trevor Manz: that isn't a big overhead to trying out some of those things.

791
00:44:16,420 --> 00:44:22,140
Trevor Manz: Versus for the Python beginner that wants to learn something in the front end,

792
00:44:22,220 --> 00:44:24,060
Trevor Manz: and they're just trying to get their data into the front end,

793
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:26,660
Trevor Manz: I just don't want them to have to worry about TypeScript or React

794
00:44:26,860 --> 00:44:29,200
Trevor Manz: or any of these things that they might hear about.

795
00:44:29,420 --> 00:44:32,680
Trevor Manz: And instead, they can just get started with trying to paint some pixels on the screen

796
00:44:32,860 --> 00:44:36,920
Trevor Manz: and then progressively learn outside of that ecosystem.

797
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:41,180
Trevor Manz: So the entry point will always be sort of this simple front-end standard.

798
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:44,780
Trevor Manz: And then how far you want to go into that ecosystem,

799
00:44:45,120 --> 00:44:47,380
Trevor Manz: then you can experience more of the tooling there

800
00:44:47,780 --> 00:44:51,220
Trevor Manz: to help with reactivity and things in the front end.

801
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:53,760
Michael Kennedy: Yeah, that's super interesting to think of injecting

802
00:44:54,450 --> 00:44:57,640
Michael Kennedy: little miniature view applications and stuff

803
00:44:58,680 --> 00:44:59,580
Michael Kennedy: to allow that work.

804
00:44:59,650 --> 00:45:00,880
Michael Kennedy: But they are super powerful

805
00:45:01,010 --> 00:45:03,000
Michael Kennedy: if you're willing to go through the build steps

806
00:45:03,180 --> 00:45:06,240
Michael Kennedy: and all the hoops that those different frameworks

807
00:45:06,740 --> 00:45:08,540
Michael Kennedy: ask you to do to get it to run.

808
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:09,840
Michael Kennedy: Once you get it set up, it's like,

809
00:45:09,850 --> 00:45:12,620
Michael Kennedy: okay, these things all bidirectionally data bind

810
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:13,660
Michael Kennedy: to each other internally.

811
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,440
Michael Kennedy: And so I can see how that plays just perfectly naturally

812
00:45:16,760 --> 00:45:20,720
Michael Kennedy: with the already binding of the dynamic interaction here.

813
00:45:21,240 --> 00:45:21,760
Trevor Manz: Yeah, exactly.

814
00:45:22,280 --> 00:45:26,140
Trevor Manz: So we model this as we have the standard,

815
00:45:26,460 --> 00:45:28,260
Trevor Manz: which is like this ECMAScript standard,

816
00:45:28,430 --> 00:45:30,440
Trevor Manz: which is the JavaScript code that you write.

817
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:33,980
Trevor Manz: And then all of the libraries are modeled as adapters

818
00:45:34,050 --> 00:45:35,040
Trevor Manz: on top of that standard.

819
00:45:35,240 --> 00:45:36,160
Trevor Manz: I think we call them bridges.

820
00:45:36,530 --> 00:45:39,440
Trevor Manz: So in React, you get hooks that you can call,

821
00:45:39,660 --> 00:45:42,580
Trevor Manz: and then you're writing code that looks kind of like idiomatic React,

822
00:45:42,820 --> 00:45:45,460
Trevor Manz: but behind the scenes, it's like calling any widget APIs.

823
00:45:46,740 --> 00:45:49,640
Trevor Manz: And our Vue bridge does the same thing, but with Vue APIs.

824
00:45:49,960 --> 00:45:53,920
Trevor Manz: So you get to write front-end code that feels like it's Vue-like or React-like,

825
00:45:53,950 --> 00:45:56,560
Trevor Manz: but behind the scenes, you have sort of these custom bridges

826
00:45:56,760 --> 00:45:58,560
Trevor Manz: that are written by folks that are familiar with those frameworks

827
00:45:59,120 --> 00:46:01,360
Trevor Manz: for how they should interface with our standard specification.

828
00:46:01,960 --> 00:46:02,740
Michael Kennedy: Yeah, wild.

829
00:46:03,500 --> 00:46:05,120
Michael Kennedy: Let's talk about not using one of those,

830
00:46:05,320 --> 00:46:09,640
Michael Kennedy: but instead talking through building a simple widget.

831
00:46:09,880 --> 00:46:14,640
Michael Kennedy: Now, just to be clear, I know we can't read all of the code audio version because most

832
00:46:14,760 --> 00:46:15,700
Michael Kennedy: people just listen to the show.

833
00:46:16,380 --> 00:46:18,660
Michael Kennedy: But maybe just give us a sense going through this.

834
00:46:18,990 --> 00:46:20,760
Michael Kennedy: You have a build a counter widget.

835
00:46:21,420 --> 00:46:21,600
Michael Kennedy: Yeah.

836
00:46:21,840 --> 00:46:23,300
Michael Kennedy: Or I can click a button and it counts or something.

837
00:46:24,300 --> 00:46:27,600
Michael Kennedy: Yeah, just walk us through just to give people a sense of what does it mean to build one of

838
00:46:27,610 --> 00:46:28,480
Michael Kennedy: these AnyWidget widgets.

839
00:46:29,220 --> 00:46:33,900
Trevor Manz: Yeah, so the idea within AnyWidget is that you create a class that extends from a single

840
00:46:35,110 --> 00:46:37,440
Trevor Manz: class that's in AnyWidget called AnyWidget.

841
00:46:38,060 --> 00:46:40,740
Trevor Manz: And that is what you define both your view,

842
00:46:40,920 --> 00:46:42,620
Trevor Manz: so the front end part of that code,

843
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:45,520
Trevor Manz: and then also the back end code for that.

844
00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:48,040
Trevor Manz: So it fully encapsulates the idea of a widget

845
00:46:48,280 --> 00:46:50,320
Trevor Manz: that has both a back end and a front end component.

846
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:53,300
Michael Kennedy: Yeah, and just to be clear for people,

847
00:46:53,460 --> 00:46:54,620
Michael Kennedy: when you say a class,

848
00:46:54,780 --> 00:46:58,320
Michael Kennedy: it's not one of those weird prototype JavaScript type things.

849
00:46:58,420 --> 00:47:01,480
Michael Kennedy: It's the more modern class keyword,

850
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:03,720
Michael Kennedy: but in ECMAScript, is that right?

851
00:47:03,980 --> 00:47:04,460
Trevor Manz: Oh, sorry.

852
00:47:04,620 --> 00:47:08,020
Trevor Manz: So what we're looking at here is just a Python class

853
00:47:08,040 --> 00:47:12,460
Michael Kennedy: Oh, this is a Python class. Okay. A Python class. Great. And so you create a Python class,

854
00:47:12,460 --> 00:47:18,840
Trevor Manz: but then it has the JavaScript CSS in it. Exactly. So ESM is like a private field that defines a

855
00:47:19,020 --> 00:47:24,180
Trevor Manz: front end module. And the whole idea there is that you define a function that's called render

856
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:30,840
Trevor Manz: that takes in two arguments, a model and an element. So the model is like this object that

857
00:47:30,980 --> 00:47:36,140
Trevor Manz: talks back to the kernel. And an element is whatever the front end, like Jupyter or VS Code

858
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:38,360
Trevor Manz: gives you is like the output on the screen.

859
00:47:39,110 --> 00:47:40,180
Trevor Manz: And so those two things combined,

860
00:47:40,550 --> 00:47:43,180
Trevor Manz: you can call methods on that model

861
00:47:43,340 --> 00:47:45,200
Trevor Manz: to set a value or get a value.

862
00:47:45,910 --> 00:47:47,780
Trevor Manz: And then you can update some part of the UI.

863
00:47:49,059 --> 00:47:49,600
Michael Kennedy: I see.

864
00:47:49,610 --> 00:47:51,920
Michael Kennedy: So you're past like a DOM element,

865
00:47:52,980 --> 00:47:54,240
Michael Kennedy: which might be a div or whatever.

866
00:47:54,410 --> 00:47:56,180
Michael Kennedy: And then you can just inject JavaScript

867
00:47:56,420 --> 00:47:58,640
Michael Kennedy: like a pen child and other stuff

868
00:47:58,860 --> 00:47:59,780
Michael Kennedy: and set a class and whatever.

869
00:47:59,910 --> 00:48:01,800
Michael Kennedy: And that builds out the little,

870
00:48:02,300 --> 00:48:03,560
Michael Kennedy: the part of the DOM that you control

871
00:48:03,740 --> 00:48:04,360
Michael Kennedy: or it's given to you.

872
00:48:04,820 --> 00:48:05,000
Trevor Manz: Exactly.

873
00:48:05,560 --> 00:48:07,500
Trevor Manz: And then you can style that however way that you want.

874
00:48:08,980 --> 00:48:12,380
Trevor Manz: And then the key thing is that as a part of this adapter,

875
00:48:13,320 --> 00:48:16,160
Trevor Manz: when you call methods on this model object that you get,

876
00:48:16,700 --> 00:48:18,580
Trevor Manz: I think there's only a few methods that are on it,

877
00:48:18,660 --> 00:48:20,260
Trevor Manz: like get, set, and save changes.

878
00:48:21,020 --> 00:48:23,500
Trevor Manz: And that just synchronizes values back and forth

879
00:48:23,780 --> 00:48:25,120
Trevor Manz: between the front end and the back end.

880
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:29,500
Trevor Manz: And that same sort of API is on the Python side as well.

881
00:48:29,660 --> 00:48:31,700
Trevor Manz: And so you can react to those values as they update

882
00:48:32,180 --> 00:48:34,180
Trevor Manz: or set them as well on the Python side.

883
00:48:35,100 --> 00:48:37,640
Trevor Manz: So, and then we'll deal for the most part,

884
00:48:37,790 --> 00:48:40,700
Trevor Manz: like with serialization of simple data types to one.

885
00:48:40,750 --> 00:48:42,300
Trevor Manz: So if you have a float or an int in Python,

886
00:48:42,450 --> 00:48:44,080
Trevor Manz: we'll just map that to a number data type.

887
00:48:45,020 --> 00:48:46,280
Trevor Manz: We have that mapping in our documentation.

888
00:48:47,220 --> 00:48:49,360
Trevor Manz: If you want to serialize to something like JSON,

889
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:50,380
Trevor Manz: that's totally fine too.

890
00:48:52,540 --> 00:48:53,840
Trevor Manz: And then you just send that over the wire.

891
00:48:54,420 --> 00:48:54,520
Michael Kennedy: Yeah.

892
00:48:55,960 --> 00:48:56,320
Michael Kennedy: That's wild.

893
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:57,580
Michael Kennedy: So how does it actually,

894
00:48:58,700 --> 00:49:00,000
Michael Kennedy: so we've got a Python class,

895
00:49:00,090 --> 00:49:01,720
Michael Kennedy: which I guess probably lives in the kernel.

896
00:49:02,740 --> 00:49:07,060
Michael Kennedy: and then it's got HTML JavaScript stuff it's doing,

897
00:49:07,790 --> 00:49:08,700
Michael Kennedy: then it's setting values.

898
00:49:11,720 --> 00:49:12,860
Michael Kennedy: What's this exchange?

899
00:49:13,220 --> 00:49:15,240
Michael Kennedy: Where do different pieces run?

900
00:49:15,330 --> 00:49:16,660
Michael Kennedy: How do they communicate?

901
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:17,460
Trevor Manz: Sure.

902
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:19,580
Trevor Manz: So that is up to the implementation.

903
00:49:19,970 --> 00:49:22,300
Trevor Manz: So whoever builds an adapter for any widget.

904
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:25,580
Trevor Manz: But the idea is that the front-end code that you write

905
00:49:25,740 --> 00:49:27,040
Trevor Manz: is in the standardized form.

906
00:49:27,360 --> 00:49:28,620
Trevor Manz: So you can just call import

907
00:49:28,950 --> 00:49:31,780
Trevor Manz: and import this JavaScript module that you have.

908
00:49:32,460 --> 00:49:38,300
Trevor Manz: And then the front end is responsible for when these different methods get called on model

909
00:49:38,500 --> 00:49:44,020
Trevor Manz: for sending that data back and communicating over some sort of mechanism to the back end.

910
00:49:44,540 --> 00:49:46,700
Michael Kennedy: Jupyter already has defined something like that.

911
00:49:46,850 --> 00:49:49,100
Trevor Manz: So Jupyter has a notion of something called a com,

912
00:49:49,580 --> 00:49:53,340
Trevor Manz: and that is implemented over a web socket to communicate back and forth.

913
00:49:53,750 --> 00:49:56,460
Trevor Manz: And similar in Marimo, we're not based on Jupyter at all,

914
00:49:56,900 --> 00:50:01,160
Trevor Manz: but our any-witted adapter just talks over a web socket with some different messages.

915
00:50:01,840 --> 00:50:05,600
Trevor Manz: But basically, we call this a host platform

916
00:50:05,860 --> 00:50:07,020
Trevor Manz: that takes care of that implementation

917
00:50:07,540 --> 00:50:08,700
Trevor Manz: and wires up those two ends.

918
00:50:09,080 --> 00:50:10,920
Trevor Manz: But then as the widget author, you just care about,

919
00:50:11,500 --> 00:50:13,700
Trevor Manz: here's my JavaScript module, here's my Python code.

920
00:50:14,140 --> 00:50:14,980
Trevor Manz: And they use these APIs.

921
00:50:15,480 --> 00:50:17,120
Trevor Manz: And then it's someone else's problem to figure out

922
00:50:17,120 --> 00:50:18,160
Trevor Manz: how to wire those up together.

923
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:19,820
Michael Kennedy: Yeah, super neat.

924
00:50:21,300 --> 00:50:23,320
Michael Kennedy: Kasaasa, interesting thought here.

925
00:50:23,380 --> 00:50:25,820
Michael Kennedy: I'd be super interested to see this working purely in Python.

926
00:50:26,260 --> 00:50:27,520
Michael Kennedy: Front end running in WASM.

927
00:50:27,860 --> 00:50:29,740
Michael Kennedy: New need for JavaScript strings in Python.

928
00:50:30,280 --> 00:50:30,880
Michael Kennedy: What do you think here?

929
00:50:31,340 --> 00:50:31,820
Trevor Manz: Yeah, yeah.

930
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:35,680
Trevor Manz: I think, you know, I haven't played around

931
00:50:35,820 --> 00:50:38,220
Trevor Manz: with some of the PyDide or like the...

932
00:50:38,220 --> 00:50:39,620
Michael Kennedy: The PyScript stuff, maybe.

933
00:50:40,080 --> 00:50:40,220
Trevor Manz: PyScript APIs.

934
00:50:40,660 --> 00:50:42,260
Trevor Manz: I think that that would probably be possible.

935
00:50:43,180 --> 00:50:44,900
Trevor Manz: The example that you had of draw data before

936
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,560
Trevor Manz: for the Marimo notebook that Vincent had,

937
00:50:49,140 --> 00:50:50,660
Trevor Manz: that is entirely running in the browser.

938
00:50:50,980 --> 00:50:55,300
Trevor Manz: So that is like the Marimo Python kernel is running in Wasm

939
00:50:55,320 --> 00:50:57,400
Trevor Manz: and then we're also loading like the JavaScript code.

940
00:50:57,660 --> 00:51:01,280
Trevor Manz: So we do have folks that just like create a Marimo notebook

941
00:51:01,300 --> 00:51:03,460
Trevor Manz: And then compile it to WebAssembly.

942
00:51:03,610 --> 00:51:07,460
Trevor Manz: And then they have a static website that has both of these bits together.

943
00:51:08,060 --> 00:51:08,500
Michael Kennedy: OK.

944
00:51:09,340 --> 00:51:10,820
Michael Kennedy: That's actually pretty wild, isn't it?

945
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:11,420
Michael Kennedy: Yeah.

946
00:51:13,900 --> 00:51:17,120
Michael Kennedy: So I've seen that there's some other places that I can--

947
00:51:17,250 --> 00:51:19,260
Michael Kennedy: any widget, like Myst.

948
00:51:19,700 --> 00:51:20,100
Trevor Manz: Yeah.

949
00:51:21,640 --> 00:51:22,800
Michael Kennedy: And also Mosaic.

950
00:51:22,870 --> 00:51:23,440
Michael Kennedy: Tell us about these.

951
00:51:23,860 --> 00:51:24,700
Trevor Manz: Yeah, yeah, definitely.

952
00:51:25,160 --> 00:51:28,880
Trevor Manz: So Myst, I think on our community page,

953
00:51:28,910 --> 00:51:30,360
Trevor Manz: we have a notion of widgets.

954
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:34,920
Trevor Manz: And then we have a notion of host platforms.

955
00:51:35,230 --> 00:51:38,060
Trevor Manz: And so the two primary host platforms right now

956
00:51:38,360 --> 00:51:39,920
Trevor Manz: are things that are Jupyter-based,

957
00:51:40,040 --> 00:51:48,360
Trevor Manz: so like VS Code, Notebooks, Google Colab, Binder,

958
00:51:48,840 --> 00:51:50,740
Trevor Manz: all these things that are based off of a Jupyter kernel

959
00:51:50,850 --> 00:51:52,420
Trevor Manz: and run Python behind the scenes.

960
00:51:53,980 --> 00:51:56,140
Trevor Manz: Then Marimo is another host platform,

961
00:51:56,520 --> 00:51:58,840
Trevor Manz: and Mist is currently working on an integration

962
00:51:59,180 --> 00:52:02,440
Trevor Manz: around that specification for the front-end code.

963
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:05,120
Trevor Manz: And so the idea is as long as they have a way to,

964
00:52:05,380 --> 00:52:07,860
Trevor Manz: and I'm not sure how far along that is at the moment,

965
00:52:08,040 --> 00:52:10,240
Trevor Manz: but as long as there is a way to run Python code

966
00:52:10,440 --> 00:52:12,280
Trevor Manz: and sort of maintain that relationship

967
00:52:12,580 --> 00:52:14,080
Trevor Manz: between that front-end code and back-end code,

968
00:52:14,240 --> 00:52:16,820
Trevor Manz: then you could drop any widgets

969
00:52:17,080 --> 00:52:19,160
Trevor Manz: within your MIST markdown, for example, as well.

970
00:52:19,160 --> 00:52:20,480
Michael Kennedy: Yeah. MIST is wild.

971
00:52:20,540 --> 00:52:22,840
Michael Kennedy: I had that team on the podcast a while ago.

972
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:26,260
Michael Kennedy: It's like, you want to create an e-book based on notebooks

973
00:52:26,420 --> 00:52:31,160
Michael Kennedy: or whatever, LaTeX paper, or you name it, right?

974
00:52:31,520 --> 00:52:31,720
Trevor Manz: Yeah.

975
00:52:33,620 --> 00:52:35,880
Michael Kennedy: And yeah, I haven't done anything with Mosaic.

976
00:52:37,220 --> 00:52:40,200
Trevor Manz: Yeah, Mosaic, I think this is a really cool project.

977
00:52:40,600 --> 00:52:44,340
Trevor Manz: So at its core, Mosaic is a bit more of like an architecture.

978
00:52:44,640 --> 00:52:45,740
Trevor Manz: And this is probably one of the things

979
00:52:45,820 --> 00:52:47,120
Trevor Manz: that I'm most excited about,

980
00:52:48,060 --> 00:52:50,860
Trevor Manz: like the ability that AnyWidget is bringing to folks

981
00:52:51,060 --> 00:52:54,140
Trevor Manz: to experiment with new types of like architectures

982
00:52:54,160 --> 00:52:56,360
Trevor Manz: for building high-performance visualizations.

983
00:52:57,980 --> 00:53:01,840
Trevor Manz: Inside of Mosaic, you have a notion of some database source

984
00:53:02,140 --> 00:53:03,860
Trevor Manz: that I believe typically is DuckDB.

985
00:53:05,400 --> 00:53:06,980
Trevor Manz: Then you write a bunch of front-end code

986
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:10,360
Trevor Manz: that basically expresses all of the data that it needs

987
00:53:10,420 --> 00:53:11,600
Trevor Manz: as queries to that database.

988
00:53:11,940 --> 00:53:13,860
Trevor Manz: Then there's a lot of optimizations that can happen

989
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,520
Trevor Manz: between those individual views and the database

990
00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:18,180
Trevor Manz: that can all be coordinated

991
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:21,260
Trevor Manz: and allow for very scalable data visualizations.

992
00:53:22,640 --> 00:53:27,080
Trevor Manz: One cool thing about Mosaic is that this architecture lends itself very well to notebooks

993
00:53:27,450 --> 00:53:32,320
Trevor Manz: because you can keep that database, that DuckDB running completely in the kernel,

994
00:53:33,040 --> 00:53:34,400
Trevor Manz: and then you just have your front-end client.

995
00:53:35,020 --> 00:53:39,800
Trevor Manz: But then there's also an option where you just completely compile everything into WebAssembly,

996
00:53:40,060 --> 00:53:42,180
Trevor Manz: and then that DuckDB is running in the browser as well.

997
00:53:42,380 --> 00:53:44,340
Trevor Manz: And so you get to reuse a lot of this architecture,

998
00:53:46,300 --> 00:53:47,740
Trevor Manz: and it allows just a lot of code reuse.

999
00:53:48,450 --> 00:53:50,100
Trevor Manz: And you're just kind of moving that lever of like,

1000
00:53:50,370 --> 00:53:52,040
Trevor Manz: okay, do I need high-performance compute?

1001
00:53:52,260 --> 00:53:54,360
Trevor Manz: okay, let me put my database in my HPC

1002
00:53:54,460 --> 00:53:56,840
Trevor Manz: and then I'll just have a thin client on top of it

1003
00:53:56,980 --> 00:53:58,780
Trevor Manz: versus, okay, actually I wanna look at everything

1004
00:53:58,840 --> 00:54:00,940
Trevor Manz: in the browser, like maybe we can just compile

1005
00:54:01,300 --> 00:54:03,340
Trevor Manz: to WebAssembly and let someone drop in a CSV

1006
00:54:03,560 --> 00:54:05,500
Trevor Manz: and then we can reuse the same visualization.

1007
00:54:06,200 --> 00:54:07,200
Trevor Manz: So very flexible. - Yeah, this is super,

1008
00:54:07,700 --> 00:54:08,420
Michael Kennedy: yeah, that's super flexible.

1009
00:54:09,260 --> 00:54:12,960
Michael Kennedy: DuckDB has a very interesting WebAssembly story as well, so.

1010
00:54:13,600 --> 00:54:14,040
Michael Kennedy: - Yeah, definitely.

1011
00:54:14,980 --> 00:54:17,200
Michael Kennedy: - It's definitely catching a lot of attention

1012
00:54:17,440 --> 00:54:18,820
Michael Kennedy: and people use, you know,

1013
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:22,280
Michael Kennedy: It's the data science SQLite.

1014
00:54:23,460 --> 00:54:23,520
Michael Kennedy: Yeah.

1015
00:54:24,320 --> 00:54:27,900
Trevor Manz: And I'd say a growing trend that I've seen by being able to...

1016
00:54:27,900 --> 00:54:32,420
Trevor Manz: One thing I wasn't fully aware of when I started on AnyWidget,

1017
00:54:32,520 --> 00:54:33,420
Trevor Manz: but it's been fun to see,

1018
00:54:34,100 --> 00:54:36,420
Trevor Manz: is because it became easier to start playing

1019
00:54:36,860 --> 00:54:39,200
Trevor Manz: with both front-end code and Python code in the same environment,

1020
00:54:40,380 --> 00:54:42,320
Trevor Manz: there have been a lot more, I think,

1021
00:54:43,080 --> 00:54:46,300
Trevor Manz: experimentations around trying out new types of architectures

1022
00:54:46,600 --> 00:54:48,460
Trevor Manz: for building visualizations.

1023
00:54:48,800 --> 00:54:50,880
Trevor Manz: So one trend that I've noticed in our community gallery

1024
00:54:51,340 --> 00:54:53,100
Trevor Manz: is that a lot of our most popular widgets

1025
00:54:53,800 --> 00:54:57,800
Trevor Manz: are taking advantage of new data formats like Apache Arrow

1026
00:54:58,460 --> 00:55:00,580
Trevor Manz: to be able to send lots of data to the browser

1027
00:55:00,700 --> 00:55:02,900
Trevor Manz: to put on the GPU and render very quickly.

1028
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:07,340
Trevor Manz: And so basically there's a really cool example

1029
00:55:07,420 --> 00:55:08,760
Trevor Manz: of a widget called Lawnboard,

1030
00:55:09,080 --> 00:55:11,320
Trevor Manz: which is like a geospatial visualization widget,

1031
00:55:11,900 --> 00:55:14,980
Trevor Manz: which is a wrapper around a front-end library called DeckGL

1032
00:55:14,980 --> 00:55:18,100
Trevor Manz: that was made by Uber to do geospatial visualization.

1033
00:55:19,020 --> 00:55:20,580
Trevor Manz: and the previous Jupyter integration

1034
00:55:21,839 --> 00:55:23,020
Trevor Manz: serialized data to JSON

1035
00:55:23,330 --> 00:55:26,120
Trevor Manz: to be able to render inside of DeckGL.

1036
00:55:26,210 --> 00:55:27,360
Trevor Manz: So the moment that you had to render

1037
00:55:27,530 --> 00:55:28,380
Trevor Manz: maybe a few million points,

1038
00:55:28,530 --> 00:55:29,720
Trevor Manz: it's like you're spending a ton of time

1039
00:55:30,080 --> 00:55:30,800
Trevor Manz: serializing that data

1040
00:55:30,950 --> 00:55:32,420
Trevor Manz: to be able to put it in the browser.

1041
00:55:33,119 --> 00:55:34,460
Michael Kennedy: It's like using an ORM.

1042
00:55:34,560 --> 00:55:36,020
Michael Kennedy: They're great until you try to do a query

1043
00:55:36,180 --> 00:55:37,120
Michael Kennedy: with 100,000 records.

1044
00:55:37,240 --> 00:55:38,280
Michael Kennedy: You're like, why is this so slow?

1045
00:55:38,540 --> 00:55:38,980
Trevor Manz: Exactly.

1046
00:55:39,150 --> 00:55:40,680
Trevor Manz: And so I think there's an example

1047
00:55:40,860 --> 00:55:43,980
Trevor Manz: with Lawnboard where some data set

1048
00:55:44,040 --> 00:55:45,180
Trevor Manz: with like 3.5 million rows

1049
00:55:45,380 --> 00:55:46,579
Trevor Manz: just like crashed in the previous

1050
00:55:47,099 --> 00:55:49,500
Trevor Manz: or never render, maybe it took a few seconds to render

1051
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:51,780
Trevor Manz: or a minute to render.

1052
00:55:53,480 --> 00:55:55,460
Trevor Manz: But Lawnboard uses Apache Arrow

1053
00:55:55,780 --> 00:55:58,760
Trevor Manz: and grabs that data from either Arrow, Parquet

1054
00:55:58,940 --> 00:56:00,080
Trevor Manz: or all these different file formats.

1055
00:56:00,620 --> 00:56:03,820
Trevor Manz: And that's very fast to do because you just copy that buffer

1056
00:56:03,930 --> 00:56:05,860
Trevor Manz: and ship it to the front end and put it on the GPU.

1057
00:56:06,450 --> 00:56:08,220
Trevor Manz: And so it can do that same example in, I think,

1058
00:56:08,790 --> 00:56:11,080
Trevor Manz: one or two seconds on modern machines.

1059
00:56:11,310 --> 00:56:13,860
Trevor Manz: And so it really is this, get your data into a data frame

1060
00:56:13,970 --> 00:56:16,560
Trevor Manz: and dump it on the GPU and visualize it

1061
00:56:16,800 --> 00:56:21,200
Trevor Manz: And that whole idea of, oh, what format do I need to convert to, to be able to use this

1062
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:24,380
Trevor Manz: tool, this visualization tool that I've heard?

1063
00:56:24,500 --> 00:56:26,220
Trevor Manz: It's like, no, no, no, just load it as a data frame.

1064
00:56:26,460 --> 00:56:31,720
Trevor Manz: And then as long as you get your data as a data frame, we can throw it into the web browser.

1065
00:56:32,040 --> 00:56:32,900
Michael Kennedy: Yeah, super neat.

1066
00:56:33,560 --> 00:56:36,800
Michael Kennedy: That's the kind of stuff that normal web people don't think about, right?

1067
00:56:36,920 --> 00:56:39,720
Michael Kennedy: You're like, well, how much is it to serialize a little JSON response?

1068
00:56:40,460 --> 00:56:42,500
Michael Kennedy: Or, you know, we're talking about a million of them.

1069
00:56:42,680 --> 00:56:42,760
Michael Kennedy: Oh.

1070
00:56:43,619 --> 00:56:44,720
Trevor Manz: Yeah, yeah, exactly.

1071
00:56:45,520 --> 00:56:54,880
Trevor Manz: I guess one thing I've been impressed with is just at times where my understanding of how good computers have gotten is like, it's just shocking.

1072
00:56:55,080 --> 00:57:03,120
Trevor Manz: It's more like, oh, I think we're holding ourselves back at times by maybe some of the standard practices versus like, yeah, hardware has gotten very good.

1073
00:57:03,440 --> 00:57:11,040
Trevor Manz: And if you can make use of that hardware efficiently, there's quite a bit that you can do on very low powered devices and visualize a ton of data.

1074
00:57:12,220 --> 00:57:16,460
Michael Kennedy: Yeah, quite a while ago, like really long time ago, I did some OpenGL programming.

1075
00:57:17,560 --> 00:57:21,540
Michael Kennedy: And you see, you know, like here, we gave this scene 100,000 triangles,

1076
00:57:22,100 --> 00:57:24,100
Michael Kennedy: and it's rendering at 200 frames a second.

1077
00:57:24,360 --> 00:57:28,660
Michael Kennedy: You're like, how many operations is that?

1078
00:57:28,720 --> 00:57:29,620
Michael Kennedy: Like, that is insane.

1079
00:57:29,640 --> 00:57:31,100
Michael Kennedy: You know, this is like 30 years ago, even.

1080
00:57:31,160 --> 00:57:32,960
Michael Kennedy: It's like, that just blows my mind.

1081
00:57:33,020 --> 00:57:35,360
Michael Kennedy: Yeah, I think people underestimate what computers can do sometimes.

1082
00:57:36,240 --> 00:57:37,640
Michael Kennedy: Especially if you work with them, right?

1083
00:57:37,680 --> 00:57:42,460
Michael Kennedy: you're not doing three levels of serialization and deserialization and so on.

1084
00:57:42,780 --> 00:57:43,880
Michael Kennedy: Yeah, yeah, exactly.

1085
00:57:44,200 --> 00:57:44,680
Michael Kennedy: That's wild.

1086
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:48,700
Michael Kennedy: So what about publishing one of these things?

1087
00:57:48,730 --> 00:57:52,680
Michael Kennedy: If we go and write, I've created an AnyWidget,

1088
00:57:53,360 --> 00:57:54,900
Michael Kennedy: and it's amazing for me to use,

1089
00:57:55,040 --> 00:57:58,600
Michael Kennedy: but I want to put it on PyPI so people can UVPIP install it

1090
00:57:58,600 --> 00:58:00,620
Michael Kennedy: or whatever in their notebook.

1091
00:58:03,220 --> 00:58:04,980
Trevor Manz: Yeah, so I have a couple.

1092
00:58:05,720 --> 00:58:08,160
Trevor Manz: One I would recommend, if folks are really interested in it,

1093
00:58:08,300 --> 00:58:10,100
Trevor Manz: there's a couple videos I have on my YouTube

1094
00:58:10,310 --> 00:58:12,820
Trevor Manz: of just publishing some widgets,

1095
00:58:12,950 --> 00:58:14,760
Trevor Manz: and they're linked in any widget documentation.

1096
00:58:15,320 --> 00:58:17,380
Trevor Manz: But that file that you see there,

1097
00:58:17,980 --> 00:58:20,100
Trevor Manz: that's open in the current view that we have,

1098
00:58:21,460 --> 00:58:22,880
Trevor Manz: if you know how to publish a Python file,

1099
00:58:23,020 --> 00:58:25,740
Trevor Manz: you can just publish that to PyPI, and it should just work.

1100
00:58:26,340 --> 00:58:28,240
Trevor Manz: So, yeah.

1101
00:58:28,900 --> 00:58:32,260
Trevor Manz: The one caveat I'd have is you're looking at an inline string here,

1102
00:58:32,390 --> 00:58:35,560
Trevor Manz: and that's not always the nicest way to write your front-end code.

1103
00:58:35,820 --> 00:58:40,240
Trevor Manz: So you can also just import, like you can require that as a file instead.

1104
00:58:40,390 --> 00:58:43,260
Trevor Manz: And so you can put that code into a separate file, type check that,

1105
00:58:43,410 --> 00:58:46,060
Trevor Manz: or like lint it or like format it as JavaScript.

1106
00:58:46,610 --> 00:58:49,660
Michael Kennedy: So write a JavaScript file and then somehow set just,

1107
00:58:50,260 --> 00:58:54,740
Michael Kennedy: would I just read that in Python and then just set the text result?

1108
00:58:54,830 --> 00:58:57,340
Michael Kennedy: Like use path and say read text and then jam it in there?

1109
00:58:57,740 --> 00:58:57,960
Trevor Manz: Yeah.

1110
00:58:58,240 --> 00:59:03,000
Trevor Manz: We support if you just pass a path, lib path to ESM, we'll read it for you.

1111
00:59:03,940 --> 00:59:04,400
Michael Kennedy: Okay, perfect.

1112
00:59:04,550 --> 00:59:04,660
Michael Kennedy: Yeah.

1113
00:59:05,180 --> 00:59:05,280
Michael Kennedy: Yeah.

1114
00:59:05,380 --> 00:59:11,880
Michael Kennedy: Yeah. So as long as I have a package and the package points out that these JavaScript files

1115
00:59:12,140 --> 00:59:14,300
Michael Kennedy: are to be included at build, then you're good to go?

1116
00:59:14,840 --> 00:59:20,120
Trevor Manz: Yep. And our starter kit template is all configured with Hatchling to do that for you.

1117
00:59:20,480 --> 00:59:28,620
Michael Kennedy: Yeah. Very nice. Okay. And I've been using uv build, uv publish these days, and it's pretty seamless.

1118
00:59:29,580 --> 00:59:34,500
Trevor Manz: Yeah. Yeah. I think maybe we might need to update the build script to have uv build as the backend.

1119
00:59:34,980 --> 00:59:35,320
Trevor Manz: So yeah.

1120
00:59:35,660 --> 00:59:37,900
Michael Kennedy: Yeah, even if you do uv build against something

1121
00:59:38,060 --> 00:59:40,220
Michael Kennedy: with a different backend, I think uv just runs that backend

1122
00:59:40,620 --> 00:59:40,720
Michael Kennedy: instead.

1123
00:59:40,860 --> 00:59:44,200
Michael Kennedy: So not a big deal.

1124
00:59:44,460 --> 00:59:44,980
Michael Kennedy: Not a big deal.

1125
00:59:46,820 --> 00:59:48,720
Michael Kennedy: So what are maybe some of the rough edges

1126
00:59:48,940 --> 00:59:51,440
Michael Kennedy: that people need to look out for these days?

1127
00:59:52,440 --> 00:59:54,160
Michael Kennedy: It's got a lot of stuff that makes things easy,

1128
00:59:54,400 --> 00:59:56,480
Michael Kennedy: but what should they be maybe on the lookout for?

1129
00:59:57,000 --> 01:00:01,440
Trevor Manz: I think the thing that if folks are getting--

1130
01:00:02,100 --> 01:00:04,080
Trevor Manz: hopefully if you want to try out a widget,

1131
01:00:04,420 --> 01:00:06,820
Trevor Manz: it should be as simple as installing any other Python package.

1132
01:00:07,080 --> 01:00:09,260
Trevor Manz: And that is really a goal that we've had for the project,

1133
01:00:09,560 --> 01:00:13,700
Trevor Manz: is that if you want to use this like you would some algorithm library

1134
01:00:13,780 --> 01:00:15,220
Trevor Manz: that just does computation,

1135
01:00:15,580 --> 01:00:19,160
Trevor Manz: we want that to be as simple as pip installing and getting started.

1136
01:00:20,600 --> 01:00:22,420
Trevor Manz: I would say probably the highest barrier to entry

1137
01:00:22,680 --> 01:00:28,220
Trevor Manz: is that it is just this idea of just enough JavaScript.

1138
01:00:28,440 --> 01:00:31,719
Trevor Manz: And so one thing that I try to emphasize in the docs

1139
01:00:31,740 --> 01:00:34,860
Trevor Manz: is that I'd really start with a very simple example

1140
01:00:35,470 --> 01:00:37,020
Trevor Manz: if you've never played around in the browser

1141
01:00:37,570 --> 01:00:40,860
Trevor Manz: and get used to opening up your developer tools

1142
01:00:41,260 --> 01:00:43,540
Trevor Manz: and logging things and just understanding

1143
01:00:43,750 --> 01:00:46,300
Trevor Manz: how to develop maybe a little bit in the front end.

1144
01:00:46,760 --> 01:00:48,020
Trevor Manz: If you're coming from the front end side,

1145
01:00:48,520 --> 01:00:51,200
Trevor Manz: then it would be learning a little bit more of how does Python work

1146
01:00:51,230 --> 01:00:54,320
Trevor Manz: and how do I debug things on the Python side.

1147
01:00:54,640 --> 01:00:57,220
Michael Kennedy: What is PyPI and how do I even work with that thing?

1148
01:00:57,480 --> 01:00:57,860
Michael Kennedy: Exactly.

1149
01:00:59,020 --> 01:01:01,700
Trevor Manz: I'd say most of the rough edges are just these problems

1150
01:01:01,720 --> 01:01:03,180
Trevor Manz: working with two language ecosystems.

1151
01:01:03,680 --> 01:01:06,100
Trevor Manz: But that's also been a very important part of AnyWidget

1152
01:01:06,180 --> 01:01:08,500
Trevor Manz: because we don't want people that are ambitious

1153
01:01:08,680 --> 01:01:10,720
Trevor Manz: to build things that sort of bridge this gap

1154
01:01:10,880 --> 01:01:13,060
Trevor Manz: to feel restricted from either using things

1155
01:01:13,180 --> 01:01:15,260
Trevor Manz: in the Python ecosystem or the web ecosystem.

1156
01:01:15,540 --> 01:01:16,860
Trevor Manz: Because we could always write wrappers

1157
01:01:16,980 --> 01:01:19,420
Trevor Manz: to make things easier for authors,

1158
01:01:19,760 --> 01:01:21,840
Trevor Manz: but then we'll probably get a bunch of issues

1159
01:01:21,980 --> 01:01:23,460
Trevor Manz: that then say, hey, I want to use this API,

1160
01:01:23,540 --> 01:01:24,420
Trevor Manz: and you haven't exposed it.

1161
01:01:24,780 --> 01:01:26,340
Michael Kennedy: And they're like, hey, we'd like to use Vue.

1162
01:01:26,440 --> 01:01:27,980
Michael Kennedy: You're like, well, you use our Python thing

1163
01:01:28,100 --> 01:01:28,760
Michael Kennedy: that defines the DOM.

1164
01:01:28,760 --> 01:01:29,480
Michael Kennedy: I'm like, oh, okay.

1165
01:01:30,180 --> 01:01:30,820
Michael Kennedy: Yeah, exactly.

1166
01:01:30,900 --> 01:01:36,080
Trevor Manz: Exactly. So with great power comes great responsibility, but we want to give that to

1167
01:01:36,270 --> 01:01:38,140
Trevor Manz: people that want to build these types of integrations.

1168
01:01:38,360 --> 01:01:38,480
Michael Kennedy: Yeah.

1169
01:01:39,980 --> 01:01:46,640
Michael Kennedy: So what about agentic AI for this kind of stuff? I know five years ago, you have to learn every

1170
01:01:46,860 --> 01:01:52,340
Michael Kennedy: step of the JavaScript. How much can I say, take my inline JavaScript, put it into a JS file,

1171
01:01:52,490 --> 01:01:59,740
Michael Kennedy: and then point it at, ask Claude Sonnet, hey, this is an any widget widget, and this is the

1172
01:01:59,740 --> 01:02:05,780
Michael Kennedy: JavaScript and here's what I'm trying to accomplish. Like I bet you could go pretty far with a marginal

1173
01:02:06,060 --> 01:02:10,580
Michael Kennedy: understanding of JavaScript and as a Python person plus some kind of AI. What do you think?

1174
01:02:11,200 --> 01:02:18,240
Trevor Manz: Oh yeah, absolutely. I think, like I mentioned earlier, Vincent works and I work very closely

1175
01:02:18,380 --> 01:02:22,800
Trevor Manz: together. And his joke that he likes to tell is that I created any widgets so that he could make

1176
01:02:22,820 --> 01:02:29,660
Trevor Manz: any widgets and he uh he's um the ability to like vibe code sort of the front end for

1177
01:02:30,480 --> 01:02:34,740
Trevor Manz: like an object really is eye-opening if you've never tried it before if you're like working with

1178
01:02:34,760 --> 01:02:41,120
Trevor Manz: your data and i think one of the barriers maybe of like trying out or of like knowing when uh

1179
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:46,020
Trevor Manz: or thinking about how to use any widget is like knowing when it might be useful and really it's

1180
01:02:46,020 --> 01:02:49,940
Trevor Manz: like anytime you have an object that like you might want to visualize in a particular way

1181
01:02:50,080 --> 01:02:54,060
Trevor Manz: or maybe extend with some extra capabilities

1182
01:02:54,540 --> 01:02:55,680
Trevor Manz: in your notebook environment,

1183
01:02:56,120 --> 01:03:00,100
Trevor Manz: that's a perfect time to open up some agentic tool

1184
01:03:00,400 --> 01:03:03,060
Trevor Manz: and start trying to explain what you're thinking about.

1185
01:03:03,300 --> 01:03:05,740
Trevor Manz: And because it's just JavaScript

1186
01:03:05,920 --> 01:03:07,860
Trevor Manz: and not a custom framework that we wrote,

1187
01:03:09,780 --> 01:03:12,120
Trevor Manz: they're very good at writing this type of code.

1188
01:03:12,700 --> 01:03:16,040
Trevor Manz: Sometimes we have a set of rules to try to help it,

1189
01:03:16,460 --> 01:03:18,380
Trevor Manz: make sure it doesn't try to do React or something,

1190
01:03:18,720 --> 01:03:20,360
Trevor Manz: but it can go very far.

1191
01:03:20,740 --> 01:03:23,440
Trevor Manz: And because it's just like a view on top of like your data,

1192
01:03:23,640 --> 01:03:25,300
Trevor Manz: it's like, it's kind of the perfect thing

1193
01:03:25,360 --> 01:03:27,180
Trevor Manz: to play around with vibe coding, I think.

1194
01:03:28,100 --> 01:03:30,160
Michael Kennedy: It's incredible how far you can go with this stuff.

1195
01:03:30,180 --> 01:03:32,820
Michael Kennedy: You can give it your data source and say,

1196
01:03:32,900 --> 01:03:34,500
Michael Kennedy: here's the data source, here's what I'm trying to do.

1197
01:03:34,640 --> 01:03:36,680
Michael Kennedy: And because the data sources often can be

1198
01:03:36,940 --> 01:03:38,620
Michael Kennedy: really foundational like CSV or whatever.

1199
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:42,560
Michael Kennedy: And then importantly, because it's just pure JavaScript,

1200
01:03:43,900 --> 01:03:46,600
Michael Kennedy: AI can go, AI goes crazy on pure JavaScript

1201
01:03:46,760 --> 01:03:47,800
Michael Kennedy: and pure Python, right?

1202
01:03:47,880 --> 01:03:49,640
Michael Kennedy: It's unleashed.

1203
01:03:49,840 --> 01:03:50,420
Michael Kennedy: Yeah, it's crazy.

1204
01:03:50,700 --> 01:03:54,120
Trevor Manz: So to plug it back to Marimo for a second,

1205
01:03:54,310 --> 01:03:57,840
Trevor Manz: I think because it's just Python and just JavaScript,

1206
01:03:58,080 --> 01:04:00,940
Trevor Manz: it's a really fun environment to actually create any widgets in.

1207
01:04:01,050 --> 01:04:05,840
Trevor Manz: And we have some integrations with AI chat within our editor

1208
01:04:07,710 --> 01:04:10,560
Trevor Manz: where we actually will inspect some of your Python variables

1209
01:04:10,800 --> 01:04:13,420
Trevor Manz: and include that in the prompts as you're trying to work on things.

1210
01:04:13,540 --> 01:04:14,940
Trevor Manz: So if you're saying, hey, I want to make a widget

1211
01:04:15,760 --> 01:04:17,580
Trevor Manz: and I want to visualize this data frame,

1212
01:04:17,700 --> 01:04:21,940
Trevor Manz: you can actually tag the object that you want to start programming around.

1213
01:04:22,520 --> 01:04:24,440
Trevor Manz: And that will include things like the schema and stuff

1214
01:04:24,580 --> 01:04:25,580
Trevor Manz: as it gives it to the model,

1215
01:04:25,860 --> 01:04:28,980
Trevor Manz: such that then that sort of grounds it,

1216
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:30,420
Trevor Manz: at least when it's writing that JavaScript code,

1217
01:04:30,440 --> 01:04:32,640
Trevor Manz: to grab the right columns and things off the data set

1218
01:04:32,920 --> 01:04:33,880
Trevor Manz: and get to the ground running

1219
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:36,360
Trevor Manz: without you having to procure those things as well.

1220
01:04:36,500 --> 01:04:39,500
Trevor Manz: So it's a pretty fun environment to create these things.

1221
01:04:40,080 --> 01:04:41,900
Michael Kennedy: It's a weird time, isn't it, that we live in?

1222
01:04:41,960 --> 01:04:44,820
Michael Kennedy: Kind of magical and also scary, but just weird.

1223
01:04:45,240 --> 01:04:45,940
Michael Kennedy: Yeah, definitely.

1224
01:04:46,280 --> 01:04:47,860
Michael Kennedy: but very much fun as well.

1225
01:04:49,120 --> 01:04:49,780
Michael Kennedy: I would throw out there,

1226
01:04:50,120 --> 01:04:51,020
Michael Kennedy: if people are interested,

1227
01:04:51,480 --> 01:04:54,160
Michael Kennedy: check out the Matt Makai episode I did

1228
01:04:54,240 --> 01:04:55,320
Michael Kennedy: on HNTech programming

1229
01:04:56,220 --> 01:04:57,300
Michael Kennedy: three or four episodes ago

1230
01:04:58,380 --> 01:04:59,200
Michael Kennedy: and choose a good model.

1231
01:04:59,540 --> 01:05:00,420
Michael Kennedy: I find people are like,

1232
01:05:00,420 --> 01:05:01,700
Michael Kennedy: I tried this, it did a bunch of junk.

1233
01:05:01,880 --> 01:05:03,540
Michael Kennedy: It's like, yeah, but use the free tier, right?

1234
01:05:03,640 --> 01:05:03,980
Michael Kennedy: I see.

1235
01:05:05,500 --> 01:05:06,180
Michael Kennedy: There's a big difference

1236
01:05:06,420 --> 01:05:07,520
Michael Kennedy: between the top tier models

1237
01:05:08,260 --> 01:05:09,500
Michael Kennedy: and the cheaper ones.

1238
01:05:11,180 --> 01:05:12,980
Michael Kennedy: All right, where are we going?

1239
01:05:13,620 --> 01:05:15,240
Michael Kennedy: What's the roadmap look like for any widget?

1240
01:05:15,840 --> 01:05:32,700
Trevor Manz: Yeah, so the roadmap for AnyWidget, I think, looks a lot like trying to get authors to understand some of these patterns that are emerging in the ecosystem for building some of these maybe more high-performance visualization tools.

1241
01:05:34,020 --> 01:05:38,360
Trevor Manz: In terms of the library itself, there may be a few features that we want to add for users.

1242
01:05:38,480 --> 01:05:48,140
Trevor Manz: But I think one of the most important things is that we just ensure that we stay backwards compatible now that we have something that people are building around.

1243
01:05:48,400 --> 01:05:59,260
Trevor Manz: And so my call to action is just to try to get more folks, if they are curious, to try out building new widgets and try to let's keep this ecosystem pretty healthy.

1244
01:05:59,760 --> 01:06:13,600
Trevor Manz: And then on top of that, if there are places where folks are running into limitations of the specification as is, then getting invested parties either from the implementers to try to understand what APIs we need to add to support things in the future.

1245
01:06:13,960 --> 01:06:14,960
Michael Kennedy: So, yeah.

1246
01:06:15,320 --> 01:06:15,820
Michael Kennedy: Amazing.

1247
01:06:18,400 --> 01:06:22,560
Michael Kennedy: It was on my mind, but I forgot to ask it when we were talking about this, where things run.

1248
01:06:22,620 --> 01:06:29,460
Michael Kennedy: And if this is running in the kernel and you're doing HPC type stuff, I could potentially

1249
01:06:29,720 --> 01:06:32,300
Michael Kennedy: use Rust or C++ as part of building my widget.

1250
01:06:32,500 --> 01:06:32,760
Michael Kennedy: Is that right?

1251
01:06:33,280 --> 01:06:33,980
Trevor Manz: Yeah, definitely.

1252
01:06:34,540 --> 01:06:39,860
Trevor Manz: So one pattern we've seen is you just try to do as little as you, just the interactive

1253
01:06:40,120 --> 01:06:41,640
Trevor Manz: bits that you want in the front end.

1254
01:06:41,890 --> 01:06:46,940
Trevor Manz: And then you have the full resources of anything that you can do in Python on the backend side.

1255
01:06:47,140 --> 01:06:51,540
Trevor Manz: And because Python is such a language that has sort of grown to be able to be extended

1256
01:06:51,560 --> 01:06:53,900
Trevor Manz: with all these systems-level programming languages,

1257
01:06:54,240 --> 01:06:56,420
Trevor Manz: there's a lot that you can tap into there

1258
01:06:56,440 --> 01:06:58,360
Trevor Manz: in terms of high-performance compute.

1259
01:07:00,120 --> 01:07:02,980
Trevor Manz: So my hope is that really we push user

1260
01:07:03,160 --> 01:07:05,260
Trevor Manz: or push any widget authors of creating

1261
01:07:06,080 --> 01:07:07,140
Trevor Manz: interesting interactive elements

1262
01:07:07,440 --> 01:07:10,220
Trevor Manz: that then allow us to really have that extra input

1263
01:07:10,440 --> 01:07:15,320
Trevor Manz: into these really scalable data ecosystem

1264
01:07:15,340 --> 01:07:16,660
Trevor Manz: that we have on the Python side.

1265
01:07:16,880 --> 01:07:17,280
Michael Kennedy: Awesome.

1266
01:07:18,660 --> 01:07:19,400
Michael Kennedy: PR is accepted?

1267
01:07:20,099 --> 01:07:20,900
Trevor Manz: Absolutely, yeah.

1268
01:07:21,280 --> 01:07:27,580
Michael Kennedy: Yeah, yeah. Okay. So yeah, people can check it out here on GitHub. Of course, we'll link to that.

1269
01:07:29,160 --> 01:07:32,520
Michael Kennedy: Yeah. You got ideas? All right. Get in there and add it.

1270
01:07:33,640 --> 01:07:39,620
Trevor Manz: Yeah. And we also have a Discord. So folks, like you open up a notebook and you run into something

1271
01:07:39,790 --> 01:07:46,280
Trevor Manz: or you just, you have an idea, like there's plenty of folks or I'm in there. And I love to try to get

1272
01:07:46,300 --> 01:07:50,820
Trevor Manz: people for their first bit of JavaScript ever. I think it's pretty fun when someone has an idea

1273
01:07:51,210 --> 01:07:56,120
Michael Kennedy: and we help them get there. But it's JavaScript. No, no, you're going to be okay. It's not that

1274
01:07:56,220 --> 01:07:59,820
Michael Kennedy: much. It's just enough JavaScript, right? Exactly. Whatever that means to you.

1275
01:08:00,940 --> 01:08:07,080
Michael Kennedy: Exactly. Just enough so that my thing works. All right. Trevor, thank you so much for being on the

1276
01:08:07,220 --> 01:08:13,160
Michael Kennedy: show. I really appreciate it. And congrats on any widget. Looks super cool. It definitely looks

1277
01:08:13,180 --> 01:08:15,100
Michael Kennedy: so I could solve any need and easy to work with.

1278
01:08:15,579 --> 01:08:16,960
Trevor Manz: - Yeah, thanks so much for having me.

1279
01:08:17,520 --> 01:08:18,000
Michael Kennedy: - Yeah, you bet.

1280
01:08:18,440 --> 01:08:18,660
Michael Kennedy: See you later.

1281
01:08:18,920 --> 01:08:19,359
Trevor Manz: - See ya.
