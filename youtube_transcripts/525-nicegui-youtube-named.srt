00:00:01,479 --> 00:00:04,400
Michael Kennedy: Falko, Radja, welcome to Talk Python To Me.

2
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:13,740
Michael Kennedy: I'm so excited to talk about GUIs, maybe even a little hint of a desktop GUI for Python.

3
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:14,600
Michael Kennedy: Oh my goodness.

4
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:16,400
Michael Kennedy: You all have built something great.

5
00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:17,800
Michael Kennedy: So welcome to Talk Python To Me.

6
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:18,580
Rodja: Happy to have you here.

7
00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:19,760
Rodja: Falko RAJIA: Thank you for having us.

8
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:22,580
Michael Kennedy: Yeah, great to have you here.

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,520
Michael Kennedy: We're going to talk about NiceGUI.

10
00:00:26,059 --> 00:00:29,640
Michael Kennedy: Sometimes said Nice GUI, but we're going to learn that it's NiceGUI.

11
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:42,200
Michael Kennedy: And basically, a nice blend of Python plus web plus a possible package in these up as-- I don't know what you want to call it.

12
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:43,720
Michael Kennedy: I think the name's probably already taken.

13
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:47,120
Michael Kennedy: But I feel like not Electron, but Positron, right?

14
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:51,420
Speaker 3: Like we got to have something with a P, but that's kind of like Electron for like-- Good idea.

15
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:57,760
Michael Kennedy: Yeah, I believe Posit might already have that taken for their new IDE thing.

16
00:00:58,200 --> 00:00:59,980
Michael Kennedy: Anyway, welcome.

17
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:04,239
Michael Kennedy: Let's get a quick bit of background on both of you all before we dive into the project.

18
00:01:04,839 --> 00:01:05,540
Michael Kennedy: Falko, you want to go first?

19
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:06,780
Falko: Tell us about yourself.

20
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:09,740
Falko: Yeah, I'm Falko Schindler.

21
00:01:10,819 --> 00:01:18,340
Falko: I'm basically addicted to programming since my childhood, but I only discovered Python around 12 years ago.

22
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:21,720
Falko: It was the time when I finished my PhD at the university.

23
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:27,260
Falko: And that was also the time I met Rodja and I became one of his first employees.

24
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:30,460
Falko: of the newly founded company, Zauberzeug.

25
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:35,320
Falko: And now I'm a full stack software developer and robotics engineer.

26
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:45,300
Falko: And I've been working on a wide range of projects like mobile apps, web apps, robotics, microcontrollers, basically the full stack.

27
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:55,860
Falko: And yeah, and since 2021, I'm one of the, or we both are the creators of NiceGUI, a Python based web framework.

28
00:01:57,440 --> 00:02:04,180
Michael Kennedy: Yeah, awesome. What languages, what tech were you using before? You said 12 years ago you got into Python. What was before Python?

29
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:10,380
Falko: I basically was introduced to Python as an alternative to MATLAB, which I was using at the university quite a lot.

30
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:25,720
Falko: But I grew up with Pascal and did other stuff like web development, of course, with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and some C-based languages, of course.

31
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:32,160
Michael Kennedy: yeah nice i did a lot of matlab when i was in university and grad school and stuff and then

32
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:57,140
Rodja: then i escaped Rodja yeah welcome welcome thank you um my name is Rodja trapper i'm um living here in um havixberg near münster where i founded the company and um i've grown up on a horse farm um But at 13 years of age or so, there was the first computer in my room and I was really addicted.

33
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:59,100
Rodja: But I started only programming.

34
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:05,060
Rodja: Then in school afterwards, there was a course of study where I needed to program something.

35
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:07,520
Rodja: And I really got into this and I liked it very much.

36
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:12,460
Rodja: I struggled in school normally, but the programming made it all worse, I think.

37
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:18,880
Rodja: And yeah, then after a course of study of computer science, I worked a little bit in Berlin and then moved back to my home.

38
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:26,300
Rodja: town with my three kids now. And yeah, now we, I founded the company 2012. It's Zauberzeug.

39
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:51,200
Rodja: It's like a company where we do mobile automation, robotic stuff, and also a lot of software development and AI. So we bring everything together. We have mechanical people and electrical engineers, but a lot of software engineers. And yeah, we're doing all the things which are needed to be to automate stuff and mainly in the agricultural sector because we

40
00:03:51,320 --> 00:04:21,040
Michael Kennedy: are of course very close to test grounds there and yeah it's nice. Yeah very neat you know a lot of the places that say robotics they're like a kind of toy things or or you know Roomba like things but these are serious these go out on farms and exactly and in a large scale human assistance yeah it's fantastic yeah we really it's so it's like we really want to do the hard and

41
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:47,620
Rodja: the difficult stuff uh to to advance in the field and do the advanced research to find new solutions and automations for uh the difficult parts where traditionally only human hands can do stuff and we want to be on organic farms and in horse stables and so all the all the tricky parts where everything needs to be very perfectly suited together to uh yeah bring a new age into place yeah

42
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:54,320
Michael Kennedy: yeah sounds cool did you found stop azoic uh like right out of school or how did you get to starting

43
00:04:54,320 --> 00:05:37,160
Rodja: this company um yeah i um after the while studying um i was very sure and even in school i was sure that i wanted to one day found my own company but i was a little bit uh yeah i i needed to know a little bit about how to do how to run a company and so i moved to berlin for uh four years and uh get got into a nice uh company art and com and learned a lot of project work and how things work together and after that i was very sure to i can do that and i i did the freelancing and and contractual work, and then the contracts grew a little bit bigger, and then I decided, okay, this is the right time.

44
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:49,060
Rodja: I can hire my first employee and start the company and grow from there just in little steps and basically bootstrap myself.

45
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:51,340
Michael Kennedy: Yeah, well, congratulations.

46
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:54,340
Michael Kennedy: It's not easy to start or run a business, is it?

47
00:05:54,630 --> 00:06:00,820
Rodja: Yeah, it's true, but especially if you really, most things I like is programming.

48
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:15,180
Rodja: So I needed to really think about how to arrange the company and how to do the things that I still can do like 20 to 30 hours a day a week by programming and sitting down and thinking about the cool and nice stuff.

49
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:17,780
Speaker 3: That guy helps me with that.

50
00:06:18,719 --> 00:06:46,300
Michael Kennedy: Yeah, of course. We're going to talk about it. Good for you because I think staying grounded in the technology really gives you an edge to, you know, Falko comes to you and says, hey, I'm working on this project and I want to use this tech or should we use FastAPI or whatever? You're like, yeah, of course. I've been working FastAPI or whatever. Vice versa, right? Like you're swimming in the waters and it's really good. Awesome. All right.

51
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:49,900
Michael Kennedy: Well, you already gave a bit of a shout out to it.

52
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:53,340
Michael Kennedy: Let's talk about NiceGUI.

53
00:06:53,560 --> 00:07:22,320
Michael Kennedy: And like we were talking just a little bit before I hit record, a lot of the projects, it's really, I think, powerful to talk a bit about how you pronounce things because I don't know, I end up at a lot of conferences or maybe conferences, not as much, but meet people that are doing programming And they'll tell me that they installed a library from PyPy, and it was NumPy.

54
00:07:22,370 --> 00:07:23,680
Michael Kennedy: And I'm like, hold on, hold on, hold on.

55
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:27,840
Michael Kennedy: You know, the people who make that, they call that PyPI, and they call it NumPy.

56
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:31,400
Michael Kennedy: And so just P-Y-X, for example, right?

57
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:32,960
Michael Kennedy: It could have many pronunciations.

58
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:35,180
Michael Kennedy: There's nothing implicit about how you say that one.

59
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,400
Michael Kennedy: But Charlie Maher says P-Y-X.

60
00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:41,120
Michael Kennedy: And so you guys talk a bit about the naming and the pronunciation.

61
00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:42,560
Michael Kennedy: I think it's an interesting story.

62
00:07:44,320 --> 00:08:10,880
Falko: Yeah, we have been looking for a name for a UI framework where, yeah, the name, the term nice was not on the table yet, but we had a kind of mindset in our minds. And in the And we played around with the GUI term and ended up wanted to call it a Nice Guy.

63
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:20,300
Falko: A pun on the Nice Guy ethos, a guy which is just who tries to be nice to everyone and tries to do things right.

64
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:23,120
Speaker 3: Like a friendly UI framework, right?

65
00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:23,600
Falko: Exactly.

66
00:08:23,910 --> 00:08:26,660
Falko: And that's what we had in mind for our UI framework.

67
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:36,880
Falko: But we couldn't write it like the guy with a Y because then you would Google a NiceGUI and you would never find our framework.

68
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:42,620
Falko: And that's why we had to find a term that's unique in the internet and it works quite well.

69
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:51,100
Falko: There were other examples where I don't understand until today why did they call it like that?

70
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:53,540
Falko: You just don't find it.

71
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:57,680
Falko: Yeah, that was basically the motivation for the name.

72
00:08:58,420 --> 00:09:04,420
Falko: And we didn't make it that explicit that it should be pronounced "NiceGUI," but we are

73
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:05,520
Michael Kennedy: fine with "NiceGUI" as well.

74
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:15,840
Michael Kennedy: Yeah, well, I do appreciate that you have something unique in the search, both in the search and in these days in the AI.

75
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:36,380
Michael Kennedy: I'm working on a program with "NiceGUI," like, "Well, is he really helpful?" no, no, no, there's a framework. So it's having something that you can search is super, super important. It's as if Jupyter spelled it the same way as the planet instead of with the Y, right?

76
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:42,300
Michael Kennedy: And you're like, oh no, you're never going to find anything about this. It's like all space.

77
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:53,000
Michael Kennedy: So very cool. I know at some point we're going to talk about version 3.0 and there's already a couple comments in the chat of the excited things about there.

78
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:55,220
Michael Kennedy: But we're going to save that for a little bit later.

79
00:09:55,660 --> 00:10:00,380
Michael Kennedy: Let's just start by talking a little bit about where did this come from?

80
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:02,060
Michael Kennedy: Why did you all build this?

81
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:05,400
Michael Kennedy: I'm going to guess robots, but Radja?

82
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:14,660
Rodja: Yeah, of course it's robots because a lot of things hinge around the robot interfaces and interaction with that.

83
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:25,500
Rodja: Basically, I think we did a lot of interface design before, and we also invented interfaces before and how to write them.

84
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:36,560
Rodja: But one day, Falko came into the office and said, "Okay, I need to control this motor controller and I need to tune it." And the robot is driving around, so we only have Wi-Fi.

85
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:38,740
Rodja: We need to have some access to the system.

86
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:45,980
Rodja: And he basically wrote something up where he could write some Python code, and there came out some web interface.

87
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:47,100
Rodja: And it was really nice.

88
00:10:47,190 --> 00:10:48,500
Rodja: And I said, "Whoa, this is great.

89
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:52,680
Rodja: "Let's do that." And maybe, Falko, you can take it from here because--

90
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:55,960
Falko: - Yeah, exactly.

91
00:10:56,150 --> 00:11:13,620
Falko: We had a kind of a moving target and we had to control it, but just the command line interface is sometimes too weak to control sliders, because we had to tune some parameters or we wanted some sliders and maybe a joystick and some things like that.

92
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:24,440
Falko: And I think the manufacturer already came with some user interface for it, or they were in the making of such a framework.

93
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:35,580
Falko: And it was very limited, but it gave the idea of, okay, the UI framework could consist of some building blocks that you could somehow arrange, but why do it graphically?

94
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:37,380
Falko: Why not writing it?

95
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:44,380
Falko: We could simply write the building blocks in Python or in other language, but of course, Python was our choice.

96
00:11:45,779 --> 00:11:51,580
Falko: And so in Python, you can quickly create a web server with FastAPI.

97
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:54,280
Falko: So this part is basically solved.

98
00:11:55,080 --> 00:12:02,300
Falko: And then the idea was the building blocks could simply deliver some HTML with corresponding CSS and JavaScript.

99
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:05,700
Falko: At that time, I was working in Angular.

100
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:14,220
Falko: So the very first commits of NiceGUI was based on FastAPI and angular.

101
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:16,780
Falko: And later we switched to view.

102
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:19,860
Rodja: Yeah.

103
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:20,200
Falko: Yeah.

104
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:26,100
Falko: And within a few hours, the basic concept was, was there and was looking promising.

105
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:31,720
Falko: Of course, not to the extent that we could imagine it could get that large.

106
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:39,540
Falko: that was just meant as an internal tool just for doing some internal things.

107
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:48,340
Rodja: - But what we did there is we set a lot on one computer and did wishful programming.

108
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:54,200
Rodja: How did we would like to have written the UI and what should be on the screen there?

109
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:58,500
Rodja: So we rewrote it and tested it, and then we thought, okay, how to implement this?

110
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:04,580
Rodja: So we have a very, very nice interface for the developer, but how to write it actually the framework behind that.

111
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:05,800
Rodja: And this was the challenge.

112
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:11,820
Rodja: But after we did it a little bit, and then we started the first project with that, and we thought, okay, let's do all the robotic stuff with it.

113
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:13,560
Rodja: And let's do our website with that.

114
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:35,520
Rodja: So the website of sauerzeug.com is also written in NiceGUI, like the full documentation of the NiceGUI webpage and all the things we are doing really a lot of things, big interfaces where we have annotation programs and data pipelines, and so we really use it now everywhere.

115
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:42,780
Rodja: And it's grown much faster and more robust than only just conductorial motor.

116
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:45,360
Michael Kennedy: That's really great.

117
00:13:46,190 --> 00:13:56,940
Michael Kennedy: You know, even just looking at the UI, it's got this kind of friendly feel to the way the UI looks.

118
00:13:56,940 --> 00:13:57,580
Michael Kennedy: You know what I mean?

119
00:13:58,040 --> 00:13:58,200
Rodja: Yeah.

120
00:13:58,900 --> 00:13:59,100
Michael Kennedy: Yeah.

121
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:19,500
Rodja: we are very happy to have also a professional graphic designer in our team, not only for the robotics, but also for websites. And we really are thinking about how to present the things here. And you can do basically anything a NiceGUI here, because it's just HTML, HTML and JavaScript.

122
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:27,520
Rodja: You can do everything, but you can most things you can do simply in Python without touching all the underlying infrastructure.

123
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:28,480
Rodja: Yeah.

124
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:33,560
Michael Kennedy: So you're telling me that those cool robots we saw cruising around--

125
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:34,240
Rodja: They're running NiceGUIs.

126
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:36,900
Michael Kennedy: They have a little web--

127
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:37,580
Rodja: Yeah, exactly.

128
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:40,820
Michael Kennedy: NiceGUI server cruising on top of them?

129
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:41,160
Rodja: Yeah.

130
00:14:42,259 --> 00:14:45,500
Speaker 3: And how do you figure out-- do you give them a name?

131
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:58,120
Michael Kennedy: Sorry, do you give them like DNS names, like FunDN-- like Marco or whatever, like Marco-- in just HTTP Marco and start working with them?

132
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:59,200
Michael Kennedy: Or how does that work?

133
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:02,620
Rodja: The first few robots, we had some names for it.

134
00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:05,080
Rodja: But right now, we are just counting them up.

135
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:07,600
Rodja: So it's F35 or something.

136
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:12,940
Rodja: Because there are so many, and you need to really find the right one, which is running where.

137
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:27,320
Rodja: But we have also in NiceDi a web interface where we can manage the whole hive of all the robots running around and looking at the battery status and what they have done, the KPIs and so on.

138
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:30,000
Falko: The F stands for Field Friend.

139
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:33,600
Falko: So we call them the Field Friends.

140
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:36,060
Michael Kennedy: Amazing.

141
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:40,760
Michael Kennedy: Let's talk a little bit about building blocks, I guess.

142
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:43,420
Michael Kennedy: And then we could talk a little bit about the API.

143
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:47,560
Michael Kennedy: So you chose FastAPI.

144
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:52,300
Michael Kennedy: And you said you considered Angular, but you went with Vue, but maybe through Quasar.

145
00:15:53,140 --> 00:15:56,440
Michael Kennedy: So let's, why FastAPI?

146
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:59,240
Michael Kennedy: I mean, FastAPI is certainly a good choice.

147
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:00,120
Rodja: Yeah.

148
00:16:00,780 --> 00:16:01,320
Michael Kennedy: But why?

149
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:06,620
Speaker 3: FastAPI is great because it's, yeah,

150
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:10,500
Rodja: you can write very good REST interfaces with that.

151
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:16,340
Rodja: And also what you get is this whole async support.

152
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:19,980
Rodja: So you have a ASGI server running there.

153
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:31,780
Rodja: So it's from our point of view, much better suited for this super large scaling and a single CPU running all the tasks than for example, Flask or so.

154
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:40,020
Rodja: And so FastAPI was quite of natural for us because we switched from Flask to FastAPI a few years before.

155
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:44,100
Rodja: We were very sure that we can work with that.

156
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:49,940
Rodja: And this is supporting all the web traffic and server stuff we need.

157
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:52,960
Rodja: And we did also a few big applications with that.

158
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:56,480
Rodja: So this was quite a no-brainer for us.

159
00:16:58,300 --> 00:16:58,700
Michael Kennedy: - Okay.

160
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:03,100
Michael Kennedy: And then Falko, you talked about Angular.

161
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:08,839
Michael Kennedy: I don't know if this is Angular 1 or 2, but I know the transition from 1 to 2 was a little rocky.

162
00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:14,880
Falko: I mean, these-- - It was after 1, it was 2 or 3, I'm not sure.

163
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:17,740
Michael Kennedy: - Okay, so you didn't have to write out that roller coaster.

164
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:22,920
Michael Kennedy: But then you chose Vue, and if I got that right, it's actually Quasar.

165
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:24,660
Michael Kennedy: That's not Quasar, that's Quasar.

166
00:17:26,659 --> 00:17:28,500
Michael Kennedy: Tell us a bit about this.

167
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:31,980
Falko: I know Vue pretty well, but I don't know Quasar.

168
00:17:33,139 --> 00:17:34,360
Falko: - We didn't know it either.

169
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:51,520
Falko: Though I have to mention one important step in the development of the NiceGUIs was when we were thinking about a good name, we thought we brainstormed and we thought, At one point we thought it's basically, we are writing everything in Python.

170
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:54,960
Falko: So it's just Python, just Python, just PI.

171
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:58,460
Falko: So we ended up and wanted to use the name just PI.

172
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:03,640
Falko: And we looked up if there's something else called just PI already.

173
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:10,580
Falko: And as it turns out, there was a UI framework, exactly what we were about to do with NiceGUI.

174
00:18:12,060 --> 00:18:12,940
Michael Kennedy: - What was your thought?

175
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,980
Michael Kennedy: Were you like, oh no, why am I even doing this?

176
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:17,340
Falko: Kind of.

177
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:18,220
Falko: Oh, look.

178
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:24,200
Falko: They've been ahead of us pretty much.

179
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:27,160
Falko: They already had a full-fledged UI framework basically.

180
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:31,940
Falko: But it was a bit low level for us.

181
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:36,760
Falko: They basically mimicked HTML elements.

182
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:37,700
Falko: Yeah.

183
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,200
Michael Kennedy: I think I've seen this before and talked about it.

184
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:40,360
Michael Kennedy: Yeah.

185
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:43,340
Falko: Yeah, maybe.

186
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:48,220
Falko: But they also used Quaser already.

187
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:58,680
Falko: And so we still wanted to build our own framework with our own components and some nicer API in our point of views.

188
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:02,520
Falko: But we decided to use JustPy as a foundation.

189
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:09,140
Falko: And that's where Vue and Quaser came into NiceGuy as part of the JustPy foundation.

190
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:19,320
Falko: And just maybe a year later, we had some issues, some unsolved bugs with JustPy, a bit poor performance.

191
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:31,640
Falko: And there was an effort to save JustPy and to push it forward, and so that we can stay relying on it.

192
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:43,020
Falko: But in the end, we decided to stop it, to remove it from the code base, to reimplement the whole transportation layer and do it ourselves.

193
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:45,380
Falko: And it turned out pretty, pretty successful.

194
00:19:45,920 --> 00:20:07,640
Falko: I think we, we turned out,  yeah, with less bugs, with a better performance and,  and maybe, maybe a year later, just by was basically, put on hold and, isn't developed any, any longer, but it was a very important,  tool for us.

195
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:09,920
Falko: a very important foundation.

196
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:24,840
Rodja: It's a great stepping stone to give us some fundament where we could really, which we could use to show what we want to do with the user interface, how to develop the user interface and what abstraction is the right one.

197
00:20:25,130 --> 00:20:29,580
Rodja: And then we could easily swap out the engine after the first release.

198
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:30,360
Michael Kennedy: Yeah.

199
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:36,900
Michael Kennedy: One thing when I see, this is not a judgment on just Pi.

200
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:39,000
Michael Kennedy: People send me this kind of stuff all the time.

201
00:20:39,410 --> 00:20:41,060
Michael Kennedy: Not all the time, but often enough.

202
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:46,820
Michael Kennedy: They're like, oh, here's a really cool thing that lets you not use HTML or JavaScript.

203
00:20:46,970 --> 00:20:48,200
Michael Kennedy: You just do everything in Python.

204
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:53,340
Michael Kennedy: And sometimes the examples are just so close to HTML.

205
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:55,600
Michael Kennedy: The frameworks are so close to HTML.

206
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:58,500
Michael Kennedy: It's like, well, why would I not just use HTML?

207
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:06,540
Michael Kennedy: If it's like I have to create divs and I've got to create spans.

208
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:10,980
Michael Kennedy: Like literally the framework is just the same as HTML, but in Python.

209
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:14,040
Michael Kennedy: Like that's interesting and it's a cool framework.

210
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:26,800
Michael Kennedy: But also there's so much tooling for working with styling, et cetera, deploying HTML that I don't know, I feel like it's maybe too low level, kind of like you were saying.

211
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:28,000
Rodja: Yeah.

212
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:39,860
Rodja: And so yeah, a little bit higher abstraction where you have a button and you can put a click handler And if the button is clicked, then of course the click handler is called.

213
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:43,760
Rodja: That was really the main goal of Night Sky.

214
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:47,980
Rodja: And I think that works pretty well and it's scaled very far.

215
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:55,420
Rodja: So we could also have other UI elements like E-charts also where we have really diagrams and things like that.

216
00:21:56,700 --> 00:22:01,260
Michael Kennedy: Yeah, I think, Vito, you were talking about Vue and Quasar.

217
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:08,800
Michael Kennedy: One of the concepts in that world is kind of like components and bigger building blocks just raw HTML elements.

218
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:15,240
Michael Kennedy: Here's a card, or here's a turnstile, or here's a panel or whatever.

219
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:25,820
Michael Kennedy: And I think that that's a much better programming level to talk about these UI building block elements rather than HTML elements.

220
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:31,140
Rodja: It relieves the developer from the plumbing a lot.

221
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:37,320
Rodja: We can think about, OK, what do we want to show, at what time, and how does it all connect together.

222
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:47,220
Rodja: If it's too fine granular, then it's really-- this fine-grained stuff is really taking up all your mental energy to think about what you really want to achieve there.

223
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:49,460
Michael Kennedy: 100% agree.

224
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:53,500
Michael Kennedy: OK, so that brings us back to Quasar a bit.

225
00:22:54,020 --> 00:22:56,540
Falko: So Quasar is kind of these building blocks.

226
00:22:56,580 --> 00:22:57,060
Falko: Is that right?

227
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:00,200
Falko: Yeah, right, exactly.

228
00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:06,760
Falko: It turned out to be the main UI framework in NiceGUI.

229
00:23:07,060 --> 00:23:11,420
Falko: Most or many elements are based on Quasar or existing Quasar components.

230
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:15,440
Falko: We call them elements in NiceGUI but there are components in Quasar.

231
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:27,660
Falko: And other components or elements like eCharts or something, they are independent of Quasar.

232
00:23:29,060 --> 00:23:42,460
Falko: Yeah, so you're not tied to using Quasar when using NiceGUI, but it delivers a nice foundation, a basic set of elements you can use.

233
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:43,520
Falko: Cool.

234
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:48,540
Michael Kennedy: So another one-- let's go with this.

235
00:23:49,379 --> 00:23:58,240
Michael Kennedy: The AG grid looks like a super cool way to put grids of data, editable grids, Sortable grids.

236
00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:04,200
Michael Kennedy: And tell us about-- this is probably something you do a lot with the analytics coming off the robots and stuff.

237
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:07,620
Michael Kennedy: But I know other people do other interesting things.

238
00:24:07,630 --> 00:24:12,020
Michael Kennedy: An example on their website is kind of a stock chart that updates live.

239
00:24:13,559 --> 00:24:19,080
Falko: Yeah, we learned 8G grid also through JustPy.

240
00:24:19,090 --> 00:24:21,880
Falko: It was the way to present a table in JustPy.

241
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:24,480
Falko: So we basically adopted it.

242
00:24:26,420 --> 00:24:35,780
Falko: Meanwhile, we are also offering a UI table, which is a quasar table.

243
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:51,140
Falko: So you can choose if you want to use UI ag grid or AG grid for an AG grid, or you can use the quasar table, which is a bit different in look and feel and the interface.

244
00:24:54,620 --> 00:24:54,760
Falko: Yeah.

245
00:24:55,540 --> 00:25:03,120
Rodja: But generally what we discovered when NiceGuy grew bigger and bigger that people really are into these tables.

246
00:25:03,370 --> 00:25:05,040
Speaker 3: They really need that a lot.

247
00:25:05,610 --> 00:25:06,460
Rodja: And all the features.

248
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:09,260
Rodja: And AG Grid, for example, is really, really powerful.

249
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:24,740
Rodja: And the abstraction we chose at NiceGuy is really great to bring all this into the Python world, where you can simply write something in and you can use it in the web like it would be in the web, but you use it simply in Python.

250
00:25:25,340 --> 00:25:31,700
Rodja: And so the interaction with that, when you're writing, when you're developing, what do we want to do?

251
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:40,060
Rodja: And so it's quite a good fit together and we could map all the features basically into Python.

252
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:47,180
Rodja: And this is true for all the other elements also that they are simply just a JavaScript component somewhere.

253
00:25:47,540 --> 00:25:51,800
Rodja: And we can write a small layer around that to bring it into the Python world.

254
00:25:51,800 --> 00:26:02,120
Rodja: And then you can really instantiate the object and then it automatically connects to, we have a web server and send the messages over the secure channel to the website.

255
00:26:02,380 --> 00:26:11,100
Rodja: And so we have this great user interface at the browser and in Python, it's simply just a Python program, running everything you want to run.

256
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:17,680
Michael Kennedy: - Yeah, and I definitely wanna dive into the server front end data exchange.

257
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:18,580
Michael Kennedy: This is gonna be fun.

258
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:37,500
Michael Kennedy: But running things out, I guess we also have really nice charts with e-charts. These look, I guess, you know, there's a pretty strong data science story here as well with what you all can build and the tools you got integrated, right?

259
00:26:38,500 --> 00:27:37,920
Rodja: Yeah, of course. There are a lot of data scientists out there which really like to use a simple framework to simply show a chart. And there are other kinds of frameworks which can on that like streamlet or so um but streamlet is quite difficult when you come to state management how to do the database ss or how to integrate another third python library or so you get really uh stuck into that and this was also our one of the motivations behind NiceGUI when we invented it because of course we knew streamlit and we know how to use it but um and this is also a lot of charts or so um but nice boy um NiceGUI is really um meant to be very friendly for the programmer to not break the intentions you have and also be very powerful and of course with uh each charts and also other charting libraries we can very easily integrate we have some powerful tools

260
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:45,020
Michael Kennedy: here for data scientists yeah it looks beautiful now the final final building block that i want to to talk about.

261
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:50,560
Michael Kennedy: I kind of said this earlier with this looking towards this in mind.

262
00:27:51,140 --> 00:27:56,860
Michael Kennedy: If you do everything in Python and you're just doing HTML, then it gets really hard to style those sorts of things.

263
00:27:57,660 --> 00:28:02,160
Michael Kennedy: But you all chose Tailwind for your styling, right?

264
00:28:02,310 --> 00:28:08,620
Michael Kennedy: And if you need to, you can actually almost drop into the HTML level and do Tailwind type of stuff.

265
00:28:08,670 --> 00:28:13,280
Michael Kennedy: But there's also a fluent API in Python to apply Tailwind classes.

266
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:18,340
Michael Kennedy: Give people-- I don't know how much I've talked about Tailwind.

267
00:28:18,420 --> 00:28:20,440
Michael Kennedy: I'm sure there's a lot of people that are like, what is Tailwind?

268
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:23,940
Michael Kennedy: And then why is it special?

269
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:32,740
Michael Kennedy: Why is it especially good for this type of programming where you're interacting with the widgets or the components themselves?

270
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:43,220
Falko: Yeah, Tailwind or Tailwind CSS is basically an abstraction layer for CSS.

271
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:56,140
Falko: CSS is the way you are styling things in the web, in HTML, plain HTML is pretty dry and has no styling and you're usually using CSS to style it.

272
00:28:56,840 --> 00:29:04,020
Falko: And Tailwind CSS makes it a bit easier, for example, well, we have a good example.

273
00:29:06,020 --> 00:29:18,780
Falko: It provides many shortcuts by adding classes to your HTML elements, you're achieving more complicated things or you just can write it shorter.

274
00:29:20,419 --> 00:29:28,100
Falko: And so like a P4 is four units padding for an element.

275
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:28,880
Speaker 3: Right, right, right.

276
00:29:28,970 --> 00:29:29,620
Speaker 3: All the way around.

277
00:29:30,190 --> 00:29:46,060
Falko: Yeah, usually then the fun starts when you can add prefixes like hover, then this styling only applies when hovering and for certain screen sizes or in dark mode and not in light mode and things.

278
00:29:47,020 --> 00:29:47,800
Falko: So it's pretty powerful.

279
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:53,860
Falko: And by adding it to NiceGUI, you have an easy way to style your elements.

280
00:29:54,800 --> 00:30:02,660
Falko: You have been written in Python without having to write plain CSS.

281
00:30:03,620 --> 00:30:04,140
Falko: It's a bit shorter.

282
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:13,360
Falko: beginning we didn't think that it would take off so much, but when you start using it, you do not want to stop and then you want to write all your styling and tailwind.

283
00:30:13,740 --> 00:30:13,820
Speaker 3: Right.

284
00:30:13,860 --> 00:31:08,940
Falko: It's easy and simple. But to address your thought about, well, then you can, I'm assuming that you are thinking then you can just use plain HTML and tailwind. We thought about introducing a NiceGUI abstraction, some kind of styling language in NiceGUI, which is on top of Tailwind CSS. But this proves to be very hard. And then you don't win that much that it's worth the effort. And if you are introducing a new abstraction layer, then you have to document it, you have to test it, you have to find the right level of abstraction. And using Tailwind CSS as it is, we just can refer to the documentation, which is great, and everybody can just look it up.

285
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:18,140
Falko: And while doing though, learning CSS and styling and tailwind, that's useful as well.

286
00:31:19,280 --> 00:32:22,300
Rodja: I think we had a pull request like four years ago, or multiple attempts to create an own layout engine where you can define, okay, where, how might hold the width and how the height and stuff like that. But then you need to think about, okay, this is always the web, what you're talking about. And it's super, super powerful. And the language for the web for styling is CSS. There's no way around it. If you find some other abstraction, it will definitely break at some points and also not allow every um mutation and every uh kind of variance or so and we i i don't um maybe we will introduce something uh later on or some time but um what we really try to do with NiceGUI is that you can do the simple things very easily and you can do it very quickly but the difficult thing things should also be doable yeah and so if we have an abstraction then like in streamlit, you cannot do it. It's just you are locked in. And this is not something we would

287
00:32:22,420 --> 00:32:49,360
Michael Kennedy: like to have a NiceGUI. Yeah. I think one of the interesting things on Tailwind is that, you know, it's kind of grouped in the utility CSS frameworks. And I don't know if that makes any more sense to people who already know Tailwind. But it lets you put the CSS classes right onto the elements and that directly affects them because a lot of CSS frameworks have a kind of a very separated here's your CSS and style.

288
00:32:49,570 --> 00:32:59,360
Michael Kennedy: And then here's your the effect it has like if it's in a row, if it's in a container, which is in a row, which then has this property, then it has some effect.

289
00:33:00,030 --> 00:33:02,960
Michael Kennedy: And there's a very big separation of ideas.

290
00:33:03,170 --> 00:33:12,200
Michael Kennedy: And this is more of a let's leverage the locality like right on the element, you can see that it says font-medium, text-2xl.

291
00:33:12,220 --> 00:33:15,940
Michael Kennedy: Like, oh, OK, well, that's what the property-- you don't have to look anywhere else than right there, right?

292
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:20,060
Michael Kennedy: And so it still works pretty well, I think, with NiceGUI.

293
00:33:20,260 --> 00:33:32,720
Michael Kennedy: Because as you're working in Python writing code, when you apply the style, you apply it to the thing in a real similar way to Tailwind, unlike, say, Bootstrap or something more separated.

294
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:33,480
Rodja: Yeah.

295
00:33:33,860 --> 00:33:38,240
Rodja: Also, when you look at C# and Xaml also, They wanted to separate the layout from the content.

296
00:33:38,870 --> 00:33:40,880
Rodja: And we decided that it's not good to do this.

297
00:33:41,620 --> 00:33:51,780
Rodja: Because when you're writing UI, this is a good example for the with statement, where you open a context to do an intent like, okay, no, we have a new row.

298
00:33:51,950 --> 00:33:53,300
Rodja: And inside the row, there's another row.

299
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:58,600
Rodja: We have always an intent, invention, so that you can look at it.

300
00:33:58,870 --> 00:34:02,320
Rodja: And you see in the code, okay, there's something new going on in Clojure.

301
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:07,440
Rodja: And when you can then put the styling right to it, then you really know, okay, this is the point.

302
00:34:08,060 --> 00:34:10,060
Rodja: There's what's going on, and you can simply do it.

303
00:34:10,290 --> 00:34:12,800
Rodja: And of course, you can do all the abstractions you can do with Python.

304
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:17,500
Rodja: You can make a class from that and use the component somewhere more abstract.

305
00:34:17,649 --> 00:34:24,320
Rodja: You don't need to write like 100 lines of code in UI code right from one step to the other.

306
00:34:24,460 --> 00:34:29,360
Rodja: But when you have UI code, you can really look at it and understand very good the structure of it.

307
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:30,860
Rodja: Yeah, 100%.

308
00:34:30,929 --> 00:34:34,220
Michael Kennedy: Yeah, I'm actually, I don't know if people know, I'm a pretty big fan of C#.

309
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:36,260
Michael Kennedy: dot net and so on.

310
00:34:36,790 --> 00:34:38,260
Michael Kennedy: Not as much as Python, but for sure.

311
00:34:38,399 --> 00:34:39,360
Michael Kennedy: But I hate SAML.

312
00:34:39,550 --> 00:34:41,020
Michael Kennedy: I hate the way they build that.

313
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:43,000
Michael Kennedy: It's such a frustrating framework to work in.

314
00:34:43,260 --> 00:34:43,600
Michael Kennedy: Never.

315
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:51,300
Michael Kennedy: Interesting Astro Strongbox out there says, love NiceGUI building a battery pack simulation GUI plot.

316
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:53,580
Michael Kennedy: UI dot plotly figure dot classes.

317
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:56,260
Michael Kennedy: W dash full H dash 100.

318
00:34:56,690 --> 00:34:56,800
Michael Kennedy: Boom.

319
00:34:57,170 --> 00:34:57,700
Michael Kennedy: Just like that.

320
00:34:58,020 --> 00:34:58,320
Rodja: Great.

321
00:34:59,260 --> 00:35:00,960
Michael Kennedy: Yeah, and that is the NiceGUI code.

322
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:08,980
Michael Kennedy: So maybe it's a good time to start talking about how Maybe how do we get started working with this?

323
00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:09,900
Michael Kennedy: Let me zoom out a little.

324
00:35:12,279 --> 00:35:14,000
Michael Kennedy: So find some examples.

325
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:14,080
Speaker 3: Yeah.

326
00:35:14,860 --> 00:35:17,500
Speaker 3: Right on the art page of our website, exactly.

327
00:35:18,140 --> 00:35:22,020
Falko: There we have basically the most minimal NiceGUI app.

328
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:27,660
Falko: And it was always important to us that this is easy and short.

329
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:32,720
Falko: And the minimal NiceGUI app is basically three lines of code.

330
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:36,940
Falko: you import NiceGUI or you import UI from NiceGUI.

331
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:41,100
Falko: You add some label, maybe UI label, hello.

332
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:45,180
Falko: And then you write UI run, and this will run the UI for you.

333
00:35:45,540 --> 00:35:46,100
Falko: Start the server.

334
00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:50,540
Falko: As a default, it auto-reloads when you change the code.

335
00:35:50,740 --> 00:35:52,820
Falko: It automatically opens the browser for you.

336
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:54,960
Falko: So you're right on the right URL.

337
00:35:56,180 --> 00:35:56,880
Falko: And that's it.

338
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:57,860
Falko: And your app is running.

339
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:01,340
Falko: All right.

340
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:05,240
Falko: Let's talk through what actually happens when this code runs.

341
00:36:05,420 --> 00:36:13,840
Michael Kennedy: So you run this, and then this basically starts a server running uveacorn on the default port for FastAPI, which is 8000.

342
00:36:14,140 --> 00:36:15,500
Michael Kennedy: So localhost 8000.

343
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:22,120
Michael Kennedy: You click that, it opens in a browser, and you've got a UI element that is a label.

344
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:23,380
Michael Kennedy: It says, hello, NiceGUI.

345
00:36:26,580 --> 00:36:28,640
Michael Kennedy: And that's unimpressive, of course.

346
00:36:28,880 --> 00:37:10,420
Rodja: because it's just sending some html to the web browser and the web browser is rendering it but in the background the web page is connecting back to the server with an id of a client which is created on the server and says okay i'm connecting back i now establish a web socket connection and from there on the web browser is connected to the web server and all the events which are happening like when you have a button or so when you press it the command is sent through the web socket to the server and then the server can decide okay what to do about this what is the command what should be done and then it executes the python code and sends back the commands for the ui update to the web page and so we have this dynamic interaction very neatly packed into the

347
00:37:10,470 --> 00:37:42,940
Michael Kennedy: web socket connection yeah and that's where it starts to get interesting so for example if you pull up the docs for button it has an on click and the thing you pass to that on click is a python callable right and if i go to the button in the page and i click it stuff happens in html but you're telling me that's because there's a web socket that connects some kind of javascript trigger to a python action on the back end is that right

348
00:37:43,480 --> 00:38:19,640
Rodja: yeah exactly in the in the example here there's the on click handler is just a lambda statement calling ui notify and then a message like you clicked me and then if the button is clicked the web socket could sense the to the server that the command is the button is clicked and then the server decides okay i have a click handler on this button and i will now execute the python code there and the ui notify will then decide okay when i execute i will take the message pack it into the web socket connection and send it to the um to the browser again and the browser then decides okay let's show the message here in Quasar.

349
00:38:20,980 --> 00:38:24,180
Rodja: And so you see the message appearing on the screen like a pop-up.

350
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:34,640
Michael Kennedy: And this runs in the context of a Python executable on the server, I guess, depends on how you connect to it, right?

351
00:38:34,650 --> 00:38:44,180
Michael Kennedy: It could be a desktop application, so it runs maybe as an invisible server on your machine or in the case you described earlier, on the robot and so on, right?

352
00:38:44,500 --> 00:39:14,460
Rodja: Yeah, or simply deployed to the cloud, like with any framework, there are a lot of things like you can simply host it behind an Apache web server or traffic, or even use things like these, what we are using a lot when we are hosting services like FlyIO, they are really nice for, yeah, simply having a server, hosting it, getting an IP address and the domain registration, and then you can simply run all the code there.

353
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:16,760
Michael Kennedy: Yeah, that's awesome.

354
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:18,900
Michael Kennedy: So fly.io, OK, interesting.

355
00:39:19,300 --> 00:39:21,800
Michael Kennedy: How about Caddy?

356
00:39:21,900 --> 00:39:23,340
Michael Kennedy: Have you checked out Caddy?

357
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:24,340
Michael Kennedy: Have you guys played with this?

358
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:40,560
Rodja: I think we have not used it a lot ourselves, but this is something people in the community asked us about or use it even and reported that it's a nice and a great server environment.

359
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:44,440
Michael Kennedy: Yeah, it seems really interesting.

360
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:50,640
Michael Kennedy: One of the big selling points is it automatically does SSL creation through Let's Encrypt.

361
00:39:50,780 --> 00:40:01,920
Michael Kennedy: So if you set up a server on a domain, and you just access it, and it doesn't have SSL yet, it'll just, as part of the first request, just create an SSL certificate, which is pretty cool.

362
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:08,140
Michael Kennedy: I've thought about using it, but I have 2,000 lines of Nginx configuration.

363
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:12,120
Speaker 3: It's not time well spent to try to convert all that

364
00:40:12,220 --> 00:40:13,500
Michael Kennedy: to work seamlessly with Caddy.

365
00:40:13,540 --> 00:40:14,180
Michael Kennedy: It's just like, you know what?

366
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:16,420
Michael Kennedy: it works, let's just not go down that.

367
00:40:16,780 --> 00:40:18,300
Michael Kennedy: So very cool.

368
00:40:19,100 --> 00:40:24,400
Michael Kennedy: All right, let's go back to more UI elements and more programming models.

369
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:32,400
Michael Kennedy: I think it might be fun to take a little bit of a tour of the different things that you can build.

370
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:40,600
Michael Kennedy: So if I jump over here, maybe let's go controls, for example.

371
00:40:41,340 --> 00:40:42,120
Michael Kennedy: We talked about buttons.

372
00:40:43,820 --> 00:40:46,760
Michael Kennedy: But you've got little groups of action buttons.

373
00:40:47,700 --> 00:40:49,080
Michael Kennedy: You've got dropdowns.

374
00:40:51,220 --> 00:40:53,820
Michael Kennedy: A lot of different little expanding-- what do you call this?

375
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:55,080
Michael Kennedy: Floating action buttons.

376
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,240
Michael Kennedy: Badges that have numbers.

377
00:40:58,500 --> 00:41:08,900
Michael Kennedy: Like in macOS in your dock or on mobile phones, you've got a little icon, but then it gets a little number over it with notifications, those kinds of things.

378
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:13,760
Michael Kennedy: Talk about some of the UI elements that you think good building blocks?

379
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,340
Falko: Yeah, you mentioned some.

380
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:25,320
Falko: Most of them, if you check the first line of the documentation, it says based on Quasar's

381
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:28,360
Speaker 3: Q button toggle or Q chip.

382
00:41:30,740 --> 00:41:36,240
Falko: Right now you're looking at mostly the elements which were borrowed from Quasar.

383
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:49,260
Falko: - They are mostly not that spectacular from the implementation point of view because they've just fit easily into the NiceGUI framework.

384
00:41:50,039 --> 00:41:53,660
Falko: We are writing a small wrapper class and that's mostly it.

385
00:41:53,660 --> 00:42:03,960
Falko: We just say use the tag Q button and then the rest is done by view, translating the view button tag into a real button.

386
00:42:05,980 --> 00:42:10,920
Falko: Other elements need some help from our side where we adjust the front end code.

387
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:16,820
Falko: And then there are elements like the more complex things.

388
00:42:16,890 --> 00:42:30,120
Falko: We have 3D views where we use three JS, which is completely independent of a quasar, which we use for our robots quite a bit.

389
00:42:31,540 --> 00:43:06,820
Falko: So we implemented kind of a subset of a tiny subset 3.js is just huge but some building blocks we are using a lot, some 3D objects like cubes, even 3D meshes and some 2D elements and you can control the camera and move it around interactively, group objects, animate objects, and it's a quite powerful foundation for what you want to do with your robot maybe.

390
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:17,040
Rodja: - And what you can see when you look at the interface and the writing the API also, you simply say, okay, I get it with a new UI scene.

391
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:30,000
Rodja: I then have with a group or with some element and you can then write like the scene STL and you load some STL file in 3G, in 3D.

392
00:43:30,220 --> 00:43:54,820
Rodja: And the thing is that it's also, we try to make it very, very simple from the API that when you are writing code that you don't have this to think about, okay, what to do next and how to arrange it or so, but you simply can write it down and then you have modifiers like.scale 0.3 that you can really say, okay, no, it's a little bit smaller And here you go with auto intention and completion.

393
00:43:55,300 --> 00:43:55,420
Rodja: Yeah.

394
00:43:55,420 --> 00:43:55,660
Michael Kennedy: Yeah.

395
00:43:55,880 --> 00:43:57,300
Michael Kennedy: You know what I really like about this?

396
00:43:57,920 --> 00:44:08,980
Michael Kennedy: That the shape of the code mirrors-- the hierarchy of the code mirrors the hierarchy of the HTML and the DOM and all those kinds of things.

397
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:09,920
Michael Kennedy: That is really nice.

398
00:44:10,380 --> 00:44:16,860
Michael Kennedy: So you have a context manager for the grid, and then you put the things into the grid.

399
00:44:18,600 --> 00:44:24,220
Michael Kennedy: And it looks visually like the code of the things that are in the grid is indented into that area,

400
00:44:24,270 --> 00:44:52,520
Falko: right? Yeah, that's an example for two very important design decisions in our language, basically. The one is the with statement, which could be read as a within statement, but it's called with, but it's close enough. So you're saying with a grid, we are arranging these these elements like this and all elements that are nested in the with statement in the grid appear within the grid.

401
00:44:53,160 --> 00:44:53,740
Falko: That's one thing.

402
00:44:54,060 --> 00:44:59,040
Falko: And as you say, that results in a very visually clear code.

403
00:44:59,690 --> 00:45:04,920
Falko: And the other one is the builder pattern, which we strongly encourage and use a lot.

404
00:45:06,060 --> 00:45:19,020
Falko: Most modifiers like styling or event registrations binding can be done with a method which returns the object itself so you can chain them.

405
00:45:20,140 --> 00:46:09,820
Falko: Like you could scale the teapot and move it and rotate it and all in one line. And if you break the line, then it still looks visually grouped and you still see, okay, that's one element which is undergoing some transformations. It turns out pretty nicely. In contrast to what we saw at the just by example, which was one pain point with just by itself, they don't do that, the automatic context switching, but they use classic add functions. You have to create the object first, and then you can create the container, and then you can add the object to the container. And in And you lose complete control over the structure of the UI.

406
00:46:10,660 --> 00:46:11,900
Falko: The code doesn't match the UI.

407
00:46:13,060 --> 00:46:13,480
Falko: And that's what--

408
00:46:13,480 --> 00:46:18,260
Michael Kennedy: It's really tough to figure out when it gets to be a complicated UI setup.

409
00:46:19,420 --> 00:46:27,140
Michael Kennedy: And it's fine for automation to write this kind of code if you had a builder sort of thing, but it's not good to read.

410
00:46:27,580 --> 00:46:28,040
Speaker 3: Yeah, exactly.

411
00:46:29,540 --> 00:46:29,780
Rodja: Yeah.

412
00:46:31,940 --> 00:46:48,800
Rodja: Another interesting element could be the interactive image, which we came up with because the normal image from Quasar is very powerful but could not do overlays where you can paint on the object in image coordinates.

413
00:46:49,440 --> 00:47:10,800
Rodja: And so now the interactive image where you can simply click and do annotations like drawing circles and getting mouse events back from the image coordinates, which we use for annotating images for AI trainings and so, but also to overlay camera data and things like that.

414
00:47:11,610 --> 00:47:14,020
Rodja: And also the image can be very efficiently updated.

415
00:47:14,280 --> 00:47:18,460
Rodja: So we simply update the image content.

416
00:47:19,380 --> 00:47:27,400
Rodja: And when we send the data back to the browser, only when the browser really decides, okay, now I can load a new image, then it will update the image.

417
00:47:27,720 --> 00:47:39,280
Rodja: So if you have a lower bandwidth connection and you send update images 30 times a second, and the connection only can do two images per second, then it will only load two images per second.

418
00:47:39,740 --> 00:47:42,880
Rodja: And you have automatic frame control with that.

419
00:47:45,240 --> 00:47:45,880
Michael Kennedy: Very cool.

420
00:47:46,100 --> 00:47:47,180
Michael Kennedy: Yeah, that's amazing.

421
00:47:49,600 --> 00:47:56,280
Michael Kennedy: So I think I want to focus a little bit more on some UI elements and some building concepts to drive home a few points.

422
00:47:56,820 --> 00:48:02,900
Michael Kennedy: And then maybe we can talk some of the deployment, the 3.0 side of things.

423
00:48:07,940 --> 00:48:10,580
Michael Kennedy: So I see a very interesting question in the chat.

424
00:48:10,900 --> 00:48:11,760
Michael Kennedy: We'll come to that.

425
00:48:12,040 --> 00:48:23,880
Michael Kennedy: So one of the things I want to talk about is sub pages and building basically-- how do you build-- so these are all really interesting building blocks, right?

426
00:48:24,580 --> 00:48:26,040
Michael Kennedy: Each of these have been super impressive.

427
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:33,600
Michael Kennedy: But how do I create something that has the feeling of more than one page?

428
00:48:33,640 --> 00:48:34,720
Michael Kennedy: How do I navigate around?

429
00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:39,300
Michael Kennedy: How do I give it a navigational structure and elements and so on?

430
00:48:39,780 --> 00:48:42,720
Rodja: So yeah, maybe talk a bit about that.

431
00:48:44,560 --> 00:48:53,720
Rodja: The basic idea of what comes from FastAPI is simply you send a get request via browser, and you get a web page.

432
00:48:53,980 --> 00:48:59,740
Rodja: and then you look at it and when you click on a link, then you send another get request and you get another page and you show it.

433
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:04,300
Rodja: So this is the normal way and this is what NiceGUI supports from day one.

434
00:49:05,240 --> 00:49:16,220
Rodja: But now in preparation for our 3.0 release, we also introduced the sub-page concept where you simply have support for a single page application.

435
00:49:16,900 --> 00:49:25,660
Rodja: Only once connect to the server, get your image, get your website and then you can say, okay, there's a sub page.

436
00:49:25,740 --> 00:49:32,880
Rodja: And if I click that, then the content will be replaced, cleared and drawn a new with another function.

437
00:49:33,740 --> 00:49:37,100
Rodja: And so you can navigate on the page and it's much, much faster.

438
00:49:38,460 --> 00:49:40,380
Michael Kennedy: Yeah, that's, and it's support.

439
00:49:40,600 --> 00:49:50,400
Michael Kennedy: It's more spa friendly, single page application friendly, which potentially you could right click on and say install.

440
00:49:52,060 --> 00:49:52,880
Rodja: Yeah, exactly.

441
00:49:52,990 --> 00:49:57,880
Rodja: Yeah, I think the single page application is sounds so easy from the concept.

442
00:49:58,240 --> 00:50:05,580
Rodja: So we did a few runs and edit to get the API right and to get everything into place.

443
00:50:05,880 --> 00:50:13,520
Rodja: And if you look at the code, it's really demanding from a maintainer point of view, because there's a lot of going on.

444
00:50:13,520 --> 00:50:15,500
Rodja: You need to rewrite the history of the browser.

445
00:50:15,660 --> 00:50:19,520
Rodja: So back and forth buttons are working correctly and nested subpages.

446
00:50:19,660 --> 00:50:21,620
Rodja: So subpages in subpages and stuff like that.

447
00:50:21,780 --> 00:50:22,900
Michael Kennedy: You need to all support that.

448
00:50:23,540 --> 00:50:27,800
Michael Kennedy: You could grab the URL and then send it to somebody

449
00:50:27,940 --> 00:50:29,900
Speaker 3: and they have to open it as they go to the right place.

450
00:50:30,080 --> 00:50:30,960
Speaker 3: All these things are hard.

451
00:50:34,140 --> 00:50:35,260
Speaker 3: So is this something...

452
00:50:35,560 --> 00:50:36,060
Speaker 3: Sorry, go ahead, Falko.

453
00:50:36,920 --> 00:50:42,820
Falko: The documentation page itself uses the subpage concept, which is basically a single page application.

454
00:50:44,940 --> 00:50:47,620
Falko: our way of writing single page applications.

455
00:50:48,660 --> 00:50:53,820
Falko: So if you open the menu and jump from one subject to another,

456
00:50:54,640 --> 00:50:56,860
Speaker 3: this is all done without reloading,

457
00:50:57,020 --> 00:51:03,020
Falko: without sending new get requests to the server, just swapping the content, and that's much faster.

458
00:51:04,060 --> 00:51:05,360
Michael Kennedy: Yeah, that's cool.

459
00:51:05,400 --> 00:51:09,000
Michael Kennedy: And if I right click on it, I can say, install page as an app.

460
00:51:10,260 --> 00:51:12,280
Michael Kennedy: All right, that's pretty awesome.

461
00:51:12,900 --> 00:51:15,220
Michael Kennedy: I'm actually a huge fan of single page applications.

462
00:51:15,450 --> 00:51:17,580
Michael Kennedy: I think it's really great.

463
00:51:17,720 --> 00:51:25,360
Michael Kennedy: It's-- you know, you could save it into your doc or your task bar, and sure, it's just a web page.

464
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:35,280
Michael Kennedy: But it actually-- I think it makes a really big difference to have it there just appearing to you as a separate thing.

465
00:51:35,330 --> 00:51:40,340
Michael Kennedy: You can command tab or alt tab between them easier, all sorts of stuff.

466
00:51:40,840 --> 00:51:47,920
Rodja: - Yeah, the web is really the most powerful application engine you have ever got.

467
00:51:48,540 --> 00:52:04,280
Rodja: So running web pages as desktop applications, like Electron or like your Proton idea was that you say, okay, there's something, and we support this with NiceGuy.

468
00:52:04,440 --> 00:52:16,260
Rodja: You can simply write, okay, I will have a native true argument in the UI run, and then you start it up and it's really enclosed in a window, but it's still running the web application there.

469
00:52:16,420 --> 00:52:21,340
Rodja: And because the web is so powerful and with NiceGuy, you can get access to all these powerful features.

470
00:52:21,860 --> 00:52:27,240
Rodja: You can really write very nice applications right now with all the interaction simply in Python.

471
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:29,080
Michael Kennedy: - Yeah, all right.

472
00:52:29,500 --> 00:52:35,140
Michael Kennedy: Let's talk a little more deployment before we jump into the 3.0 features.

473
00:52:37,720 --> 00:52:44,900
Michael Kennedy: So first of all, You've got ui.run, and that was even in your three-line example that appears at the end.

474
00:52:45,540 --> 00:53:00,320
Michael Kennedy: You pass a bunch of commands like reload false and those sorts of things in order to give it more of a high-performance perspective instead of watching for reloads and that kind of stuff.

475
00:53:02,120 --> 00:53:18,940
Michael Kennedy: With that one, I can just go and put it into-- run it on my server in a VM, point Nginx or Caddy or whatever at the local host port, and set up an SSL certificate, and just turn it into a proper web application, right?

476
00:53:19,080 --> 00:53:22,460
Michael Kennedy: Because it's basically FastAPI on that end, right?

477
00:53:22,760 --> 00:53:22,960
Michael Kennedy: So--

478
00:53:23,180 --> 00:53:23,520
Rodja: Yeah.

479
00:53:23,720 --> 00:53:31,540
Rodja: It's simply starting the server, and then it opens the port, and you can access it however you like and how you want your deployment to be.

480
00:53:32,740 --> 00:54:04,040
Rodja: But I think one of the interesting feature requests from the community was that they have an existing FastAPI application and they want to have add some UI to it. And the interesting part is that it's really easy because it's all FastAPI, so we could sub mount it. And there's a UI run with statement where you can say, okay, I have this, I want to run this within another FastAPI app behind that. And then you give a sub path and then all your application is running on another FastAPI app.

481
00:54:05,320 --> 00:54:05,560
Michael Kennedy: Interesting.

482
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:06,140
Michael Kennedy: Okay.

483
00:54:08,660 --> 00:54:14,120
Michael Kennedy: And I guess because it's running on UVicorn, that's already a production Python app server.

484
00:54:14,680 --> 00:54:27,760
Michael Kennedy: But one of the things that happens frequently when you put stuff into production for more than just a small project is you have a web garden, I guess it's called, where you have multiple workers of UVicorn or something like that.

485
00:54:27,840 --> 00:54:29,520
Michael Kennedy: And that works okay if you set it up that way.

486
00:54:29,620 --> 00:54:45,980
Rodja: there's not some kind of weird issue. The main problem is that the NiceGUI architecture demands that the WebSocket connection comes back to the same server to find the ID. And if you have multiple

487
00:54:46,240 --> 00:54:52,320
Speaker 3: workers, then there's round robin from the Ubicorn to send it to some of the other workers. And maybe

488
00:54:52,420 --> 00:55:08,780
Rodja: the worker doesn't know about it. We recently introduced a feature, or maybe it's a year ago, already, that we support a storage space where you get access to via Redis.

489
00:55:09,170 --> 00:55:13,860
Rodja: So you can get the data stored from the user again or so.

490
00:55:14,090 --> 00:55:22,960
Rodja: Then you only need a proxy server which can have sticky sessions where you connect to the server and it routes you back to the right server instance.

491
00:55:23,580 --> 00:55:27,620
Speaker 3: And so you can really get a lot of instances running.

492
00:55:28,430 --> 00:55:31,720
Rodja: And we do this for the documentation page, which is crazy.

493
00:55:32,160 --> 00:55:36,540
Speaker 3: Also deployed around the world so that in Taiwan,

494
00:55:37,040 --> 00:55:39,460
Rodja: they are also having a nice snappy interface.

495
00:55:39,690 --> 00:55:46,820
Rodja: So we need to run like it's now 30 servers or so to have really at the edge all the documentation ready.

496
00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:47,720
Michael Kennedy: Wow.

497
00:55:48,200 --> 00:55:48,640
Michael Kennedy: That's amazing.

498
00:55:48,900 --> 00:55:49,480
Michael Kennedy: That's so cool.

499
00:55:52,600 --> 00:55:53,500
Michael Kennedy: So you mentioned Redis.

500
00:55:53,680 --> 00:55:58,520
Michael Kennedy: What about Valkey? Are you familiar with Valkey? I imagine you could probably just swap it off.

501
00:55:59,740 --> 00:56:17,500
Rodja: Yeah, it could work very similar, I guess. We have not tested it yet, to be true, but I think from the concept space, it's the same. You need to really store the data and get it back to get the synchronization right.

502
00:56:18,320 --> 00:56:23,140
Michael Kennedy: Yeah, I think Valkey is basically was forked from Redis.

503
00:56:23,380 --> 00:56:26,120
Michael Kennedy: So it probably-- it might be able to just work.

504
00:56:26,640 --> 00:56:26,920
Speaker 3: OK.

505
00:56:27,420 --> 00:56:27,680
Speaker 3: Yeah, yeah.

506
00:56:27,900 --> 00:56:28,600
Speaker 3: Could be that.

507
00:56:29,120 --> 00:56:34,840
Michael Kennedy: Yeah, because I think Redis changed their license in ways that some people were frustrated with or didn't work for them.

508
00:56:35,200 --> 00:56:39,320
Michael Kennedy: So a group said, OK, well, there was a really permissive license not too long ago.

509
00:56:39,600 --> 00:56:41,740
Rodja: We're going to make a version of that, basically.

510
00:56:42,440 --> 00:56:42,600
Rodja: Yeah.

511
00:56:43,420 --> 00:56:44,440
Michael Kennedy: So it could work out of the box.

512
00:56:45,440 --> 00:56:45,940
Rodja: We'll try.

513
00:56:46,560 --> 00:56:47,380
Rodja: I have not tried it.

514
00:56:48,460 --> 00:56:49,460
Michael Kennedy: Let's be sure.

515
00:56:49,520 --> 00:56:52,460
Michael Kennedy: OK, a couple other options here that I think are interesting.

516
00:56:53,280 --> 00:56:55,640
Michael Kennedy: I'm a big fan of Docker and Docker Compose.

517
00:56:55,880 --> 00:56:56,080
Rodja: Yep.

518
00:56:57,480 --> 00:57:02,260
Michael Kennedy: And you all provide a really interesting way to just run it in Docker.

519
00:57:02,460 --> 00:57:12,300
Michael Kennedy: So a lot of times I find, OK, I'm building-- I'm going to deploy an app, so I'm going to copy my code over and set up a-- maybe I'd set up UVicorn in that Docker image and then run it.

520
00:57:12,820 --> 00:57:23,080
Michael Kennedy: But because you already have that as a concept of it, you guys have a NiceGUI image, and you just map to the source and run it, which I think is actually really nice.

521
00:57:23,820 --> 00:57:23,900
Rodja: Yeah.

522
00:57:24,560 --> 00:57:27,540
Rodja: Yeah, it helps to make deployments a little bit easier.

523
00:57:28,880 --> 00:57:48,040
Rodja: And the NiceGUI image we deploy there has also some fancy features, like having a non-root environment where you can simply have your group ID and things you normally not want at the first start when you do it.

524
00:57:48,140 --> 00:57:50,640
Rodja: But when you are going into production, you really need that.

525
00:57:51,500 --> 00:57:53,820
Rodja: And it's all packaged away in the stocker container already.

526
00:57:53,960 --> 00:57:57,220
Rodja: So you can simply use that for running and deploying.

527
00:57:57,540 --> 00:57:57,840
Rodja: Yeah.

528
00:57:57,840 --> 00:57:58,060
Michael Kennedy: Yeah.

529
00:57:58,340 --> 00:57:58,480
Michael Kennedy: Yeah.

530
00:57:58,640 --> 00:57:58,920
Michael Kennedy: Very cool.

531
00:57:59,640 --> 00:58:00,160
Michael Kennedy: All right.

532
00:58:01,380 --> 00:58:03,300
Michael Kennedy: I do want to leave just at least a little bit of time

533
00:58:03,360 --> 00:58:05,100
Rodja: to talk about the 3.0 direction.

534
00:58:05,560 --> 00:58:08,560
Michael Kennedy: But there's one here that's just-- We got to talk about it.

535
00:58:09,140 --> 00:58:09,440
Michael Kennedy: It's native.

536
00:58:10,380 --> 00:58:10,740
Rodja: Yeah.

537
00:58:13,039 --> 00:58:14,040
Michael Kennedy: This is incredible.

538
00:58:14,300 --> 00:58:16,220
Michael Kennedy: This is the proton, right?

539
00:58:16,780 --> 00:58:17,500
Michael Kennedy: Yeah, exactly.

540
00:58:18,710 --> 00:58:19,660
Michael Kennedy: You guys tell me about this.

541
00:58:20,800 --> 00:58:21,100
Michael Kennedy: This is great.

542
00:58:26,679 --> 00:58:33,800
Falko: Yeah, when you run a UI run, when you call it UI run, you have a parameter native, and you will set it to true.

543
00:58:34,180 --> 00:58:40,900
Falko: And then there is no web browser opening, but a native window.

544
00:58:41,240 --> 00:58:46,540
Falko: And what used to be a website is now running inside this native window.

545
00:58:46,780 --> 00:58:52,300
Falko: And yeah, it's behaving like a native app, and you don't notice that it's actually a website running.

546
00:58:52,700 --> 00:58:57,100
Falko: Yeah, because it uses PyInstaller, or you can use PyInstaller to package it up.

547
00:58:57,760 --> 00:58:58,960
Speaker 3: Yeah, that's the next step, yeah, of course.

548
00:58:59,080 --> 00:59:04,680
Falko: You can take this app, or you can also use a regular app, which is not native, I guess.

549
00:59:04,900 --> 00:59:05,460
Falko: I'm not sure.

550
00:59:06,640 --> 00:59:11,880
Falko: But yeah, once you have a native app, you can package it, and then you can distribute it much easier.

551
00:59:12,140 --> 00:59:12,320
Michael Kennedy: Yeah.

552
00:59:14,260 --> 00:59:16,160
Michael Kennedy: Let me throw an idea out there for you.

553
00:59:20,220 --> 00:59:26,720
Michael Kennedy: With either pipX or uv, you can basically install something from PyPI, right?

554
00:59:28,520 --> 00:59:33,340
Michael Kennedy: In there, you can set a entry point, like my app or whatever.

555
00:59:33,660 --> 00:59:34,200
Michael Kennedy: Give it a good name.

556
00:59:35,020 --> 00:59:44,680
Michael Kennedy: And then so you could just say uvx space, like the name of your package, uvx space package, and it'll just run it.

557
00:59:45,600 --> 00:59:49,900
Michael Kennedy: And it'll download it and run it from the virtual environment like you need.

558
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:59,420
Michael Kennedy: I think people could start shipping GUI apps that look like native windows just using uv and uvx.

559
01:00:00,320 --> 01:00:00,780
Rodja: Yeah.

560
01:00:02,420 --> 01:00:03,080
Michael Kennedy: Have you tried this?

561
01:00:03,460 --> 01:00:04,680
Falko: We haven't tried it.

562
01:00:05,400 --> 01:00:06,040
Falko: That's a good idea.

563
01:00:06,560 --> 01:00:09,520
Falko: We're just beginning to work with uv and uvx.

564
01:00:10,460 --> 01:00:12,500
Falko: But uvx is a really powerful tool.

565
01:00:13,080 --> 01:00:13,460
Falko: You're right.

566
01:00:15,400 --> 01:00:24,000
Michael Kennedy: Yeah, and if you just put an entry point or a script entry into the PyProject.toml, then that would do the launch.

567
01:00:24,140 --> 01:00:26,300
Michael Kennedy: And then if you run it as native, it would show up without a terminal.

568
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:28,940
Falko: And you wouldn't even need to package it, right?

569
01:00:29,260 --> 01:00:29,660
Falko: Yes, exactly.

570
01:00:30,940 --> 01:00:32,580
Michael Kennedy: Yeah, you wouldn't have to package it at all,

571
01:00:32,600 --> 01:00:33,840
Rodja: and it would be cross-platform.

572
01:00:35,860 --> 01:00:37,340
Rodja: That's an intriguing idea.

573
01:00:37,560 --> 01:00:39,480
Rodja: Maybe someone has already done it.

574
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,480
Rodja: So if so, please leave a comment there.

575
01:00:43,640 --> 01:00:44,480
Michael Kennedy: Indeed, indeed.

576
01:00:46,740 --> 01:00:49,320
Michael Kennedy: OK, let's talk about 3.0.

577
01:00:49,440 --> 01:01:00,220
Michael Kennedy: So if I go to the GitHub right now and I unzoom my window and go to releases, we're on 2.24.2.

578
01:01:00,220 --> 01:01:02,960
Michael Kennedy: But I know really soon you are going to be releasing 3.0.

579
01:01:02,960 --> 01:01:04,660
Michael Kennedy: You have plans for some really cool features.

580
01:01:05,560 --> 01:01:14,900
Michael Kennedy: And sort of the title of this podcast was like, let's celebrate both NiceGUI and then sort of a milestone of you guys are reaching that.

581
01:01:16,620 --> 01:01:19,400
Michael Kennedy: Most of the people will be listening in like four weeks.

582
01:01:19,540 --> 01:01:21,240
Michael Kennedy: So you got a little time before.

583
01:01:22,220 --> 01:01:24,760
Falko: But let's just talk about what's coming in 3.0.

584
01:01:25,080 --> 01:01:26,920
Falko: You can scroll a little bit down.

585
01:01:27,300 --> 01:01:28,760
Falko: There you'll find the release candidate.

586
01:01:31,100 --> 01:01:31,920
Falko: There we are.

587
01:01:32,340 --> 01:01:33,260
Falko: Yeah, there it is.

588
01:01:34,200 --> 01:01:36,340
Falko: Three weeks ago, we released release candidate one.

589
01:01:36,500 --> 01:01:39,440
Falko: That was before I went on vacation for two weeks.

590
01:01:40,420 --> 01:01:59,020
Falko: And yeah, we are in the last steps, maybe a few days ahead of releasing 3.0 and yeah, it, it, it started with, some housekeeping and, basically no big breaking changes.

591
01:01:59,460 --> 01:02:11,500
Falko: And we just wanted to update all dependencies like upgrading from, well, the most important thing was upgrading tailwind, which is on version four for a while now.

592
01:02:11,700 --> 01:02:14,560
Falko: And we've still been using a version three.

593
01:02:17,180 --> 01:02:24,040
Falko: But as it turns out, of course, there are some nasty changes that we have to account for.

594
01:02:24,480 --> 01:02:33,820
Falko: So our users don't have to, and that's why it takes quite a while to tackle all tiny difficulties.

595
01:02:34,560 --> 01:02:51,400
Falko: So that we are trying to release a major version around once a year to get all dependencies up to date and that people are not confused that on the tailwind documentation, there's a feature which NiceGUI doesn't have.

596
01:02:51,620 --> 01:02:53,380
Falko: And of course it depends on the version.

597
01:02:57,900 --> 01:03:07,740
Falko: But at that time, once in the year we are liberal, we are free to break some things, but we only want to do it once.

598
01:03:08,100 --> 01:03:09,740
Falko: So we have to be careful to do it right.

599
01:03:09,940 --> 01:03:13,180
Falko: And we can't change it a few weeks later again.

600
01:03:15,420 --> 01:03:21,320
Falko: And we want to have only breaking changes that are okay to migrate.

601
01:03:22,580 --> 01:03:29,780
Falko: We want to have a clear migration guide and no nasty things that you only find when you're reading all your code again.

602
01:03:30,610 --> 01:03:34,800
Falko: And with the changes in mind, that's why it can become a bit difficult.

603
01:03:36,820 --> 01:03:56,500
Rodja: The new release is really like the major version is really challenging, but also a good point where we can introduce very great and new features which help the code base and NiceGUI to evolve into the thing we envisioned there.

604
01:03:57,060 --> 01:04:10,640
Rodja: And one of the great things we did, there is we have this now a new root parameter where you can say UIRun, and then you pass one page like a function, simply a function there, and this will be the main page.

605
01:04:10,700 --> 01:04:13,880
Rodja: So it's much more single page application friendly.

606
01:04:14,020 --> 01:04:19,120
Rodja: You simply have one function and you pass it into the UIRun, and this is your page.

607
01:04:19,260 --> 01:04:29,160
Rodja: Yeah, and then inside you can use UIPage, subpages to create subpages, which are then single pages running and so it makes it much more easier.

608
01:04:29,440 --> 01:04:38,460
Rodja: You don't have these boilerplate annotations at UI page and then some URL parameters or so, but you can streamline that a little bit.

609
01:04:38,520 --> 01:04:41,940
Rodja: And things like that are really nice to have in a framework.

610
01:04:42,640 --> 01:04:43,800
Michael Kennedy: Yeah, that sounds really great.

611
01:04:44,560 --> 01:04:48,420
Michael Kennedy: Will it have full SPA support if somebody writes an app that way?

612
01:04:48,520 --> 01:04:52,760
Michael Kennedy: Could they right click and say install page or install this app?

613
01:04:52,980 --> 01:04:56,700
Michael Kennedy: it'll have like a, what is it, serviceworker.js and all that kind of business?

614
01:04:57,410 --> 01:04:59,520
Rodja: Yeah, you can basically do it.

615
01:05:00,340 --> 01:05:18,680
Rodja: We don't have a Python API for the service workers yet, but of course you can always, a NiceGUI, write your special JavaScript or HTML code and pass it along with your Python code, and then you can get the data there.

616
01:05:19,220 --> 01:05:25,780
Rodja: But most of the applications, when you write them with NiceGuy, they rely on the server connection.

617
01:05:26,290 --> 01:05:30,600
Rodja: So if you are offline, it doesn't make so much sense to use it.

618
01:05:31,460 --> 01:05:42,040
Rodja: But still, if you install something on your desktop and you connect to it back, then, of course, if you have an internet connection, you can load everything and be right back where you left.

619
01:05:42,940 --> 01:05:45,740
Michael Kennedy: Yeah, I think there's two parts to single-page applications.

620
01:05:47,100 --> 01:05:49,680
Michael Kennedy: More like PWAs, I guess, is the way I want to say it.

621
01:05:49,680 --> 01:05:50,280
Rodja: Yeah, exactly.

622
01:05:50,500 --> 01:05:58,040
Michael Kennedy: And that's-- I know one of the ideas is it can completely work offline, and it uses local DB.

623
01:05:58,580 --> 01:06:01,160
Michael Kennedy: And you could just-- it's just an app that runs locally.

624
01:06:01,260 --> 01:06:06,120
Michael Kennedy: But I think that's-- a lot of apps need the server to be doing anything interesting anyway.

625
01:06:07,280 --> 01:06:09,560
Michael Kennedy: You've got to have a very complicated app to do.

626
01:06:09,780 --> 01:06:12,140
Michael Kennedy: Like, if I was building Notion but 100% offline,

627
01:06:12,620 --> 01:06:14,300
Rodja: that's a really complicated app.

628
01:06:14,980 --> 01:06:19,700
Michael Kennedy: But I think it's also really nice to have an app model for the way you interact with it.

629
01:06:19,940 --> 01:06:21,800
Speaker 3: So the window-- you don't have all the Chrome around.

630
01:06:22,100 --> 01:06:24,400
Michael Kennedy: If you close your browser, you don't necessarily close that.

631
01:06:25,040 --> 01:06:27,360
Michael Kennedy: But also just the speed of loading,

632
01:06:27,680 --> 01:06:29,160
Speaker 3: you can cache a bunch of things potentially

633
01:06:30,140 --> 01:06:31,720
Michael Kennedy: and then sync them with the server.

634
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:36,160
Michael Kennedy: I think there's still a lot of interesting benefits, even if it requires being connected to work.

635
01:06:36,440 --> 01:06:37,440
Rodja: Yeah, totally true.

636
01:06:38,680 --> 01:06:43,360
Michael Kennedy: OK, a couple of questions real quick, and then we're out of time.

637
01:06:44,220 --> 01:07:00,220
Michael Kennedy: First, Alan out there says, will 3.0 have LLM friendly docs in the sense that could I download something that I could put into my project and tell my agentic coding agent, anytime you need to know about it, this is the one.

638
01:07:00,520 --> 01:07:00,840
Michael Kennedy: Look here.

639
01:07:01,900 --> 01:07:07,500
Michael Kennedy: And then not have to have it always searching different parts of the web and so on.

640
01:07:12,120 --> 01:07:17,080
Falko: Rodja, remind me, we do have an endpoint for AIs already.

641
01:07:17,540 --> 01:07:18,240
Rodja: - Yeah, yeah.

642
01:07:19,500 --> 01:07:30,860
Falko: - We don't have the rendered documentation in a single page format, but we prepared for AIs already.

643
01:07:31,340 --> 01:07:38,940
Rodja: - When you look at the documentation implementation, it's simply Python code running through our PyDocs and getting all the strings out.

644
01:07:39,460 --> 01:07:47,940
Rodja: And the same mechanics is used to build a text version only, dump down version where you simply have a txt file.

645
01:07:48,260 --> 01:07:51,280
Rodja: And I think we provided it a year ago or so already.

646
01:07:53,760 --> 01:07:58,760
Rodja: And right now, the LLMs not know everything of NiceGUI, but a lot.

647
01:07:58,780 --> 01:08:04,380
Rodja: But if you put this URL in there to have a documentation lookup, it's much, much better.

648
01:08:05,060 --> 01:08:06,080
Michael Kennedy: OK, that's really awesome.

649
01:08:06,360 --> 01:08:07,900
Michael Kennedy: What about an MCP server?

650
01:08:09,400 --> 01:08:10,300
Michael Kennedy: Have you considered this?

651
01:08:10,320 --> 01:08:12,640
Michael Kennedy: I think it's probably not super different.

652
01:08:13,380 --> 01:08:15,540
Rodja: It could be a worthwhile addition.

653
01:08:15,920 --> 01:08:23,640
Rodja: We have not taken the time to do it, but of course contributions in that area would be really nice to make it even better.

654
01:08:24,020 --> 01:08:33,259
Rodja: I think there are also two ChatGPT endpoints which are primed to answer questions for that.

655
01:08:34,100 --> 01:08:34,259
Michael Kennedy: Okay.

656
01:08:35,900 --> 01:08:36,700
Michael Kennedy: What's the URL?

657
01:08:36,819 --> 01:08:38,700
Michael Kennedy: How do I find it so I can put it in the show notes?

658
01:08:40,900 --> 01:08:41,220
Michael Kennedy: Do you know?

659
01:08:41,390 --> 01:08:41,480
Michael Kennedy: No.

660
01:08:41,960 --> 01:08:42,100
Speaker 3: All right.

661
01:08:42,589 --> 01:08:43,160
Speaker 3: Give it to me later.

662
01:08:43,210 --> 01:08:43,880
Speaker 3: We'll put it in the show notes.

663
01:08:43,950 --> 01:08:44,640
Speaker 3: Yeah, give it to me later.

664
01:08:44,710 --> 01:08:45,180
Michael Kennedy: Give it to me later.

665
01:08:45,880 --> 01:08:58,880
Michael Kennedy: OK, and then another one is I have a friend who's building really interesting, full-fledged SaaS type of applications using NiceGUI.

666
01:08:58,950 --> 01:09:01,759
Michael Kennedy: And it looks so impressive what they're building.

667
01:09:01,920 --> 01:09:02,160
Michael Kennedy: It's great.

668
01:09:04,460 --> 01:09:08,540
Michael Kennedy: But what about authentication, multi-tenant?

669
01:09:08,700 --> 01:09:13,560
Michael Kennedy: So certain people can only see their data versus all the data.

670
01:09:14,760 --> 01:09:19,339
Michael Kennedy: What's the authentication and sort of multi-tenancy, I guess, sorry?

671
01:09:19,980 --> 01:09:20,040
Rodja: Yeah.

672
01:09:21,299 --> 01:09:26,880
Rodja: Yeah, basically, because we are running FastAPI, you can do anything what FastAPI can do with authentication.

673
01:09:27,580 --> 01:09:37,900
Rodja: And we also have quite a few examples on the web page where you can see, okay, how to do OAuth authentication with Google or Runtab authentications.

674
01:09:38,900 --> 01:10:11,680
Rodja: you could simply build a passphrase input and do a login because when you are looking at it it's simply a decision what to show the user and you have python at your hands so you can do decide whatever you want and you can load the right data from the from a database or use our local storage system where you can like ask okay for the user what are the configurations what should he is he allowed to see what other permissions, and you can store it there, and you can retrieve it from there.

675
01:10:11,820 --> 01:10:22,700
Rodja: And it's a cookie-signed process, which is a web cookie, which is pretty safe, and is right the way to do the authentication.

676
01:10:23,620 --> 01:10:25,180
Michael Kennedy: Yeah, okay, fantastic.

677
01:10:26,320 --> 01:10:32,880
Michael Kennedy: And a couple of people have asked, including SilverBlade says, Will it be possible to switch from Quasar to something else?

678
01:10:33,160 --> 01:10:39,480
Michael Kennedy: Or would it be possible to switch Tailwind for another utility-type framework like Bulma or something like that?

679
01:10:40,780 --> 01:10:41,760
Michael Kennedy: That's a good question.

680
01:10:44,120 --> 01:10:47,440
Falko: Right now-- well, starting with Tailwind.

681
01:10:47,860 --> 01:10:51,360
Falko: Tailwind is already a pretty thin layer on top.

682
01:10:51,720 --> 01:10:53,860
Falko: You can already disable Tailwind.

683
01:10:54,040 --> 01:10:55,980
Falko: Then NiceGUI runs without Tailwind support.

684
01:10:56,820 --> 01:11:01,980
Falko: And you can pretty easily add other frameworks like Bulma.

685
01:11:03,360 --> 01:11:07,340
Falko: I haven't tried it, but it looks like you just have to add a CSS file.

686
01:11:08,320 --> 01:11:09,940
Falko: You can simply add it to your--

687
01:11:09,940 --> 01:11:10,400
Michael Kennedy: Yeah, that's right.

688
01:11:10,440 --> 01:11:12,200
Michael Kennedy: You literally just include the CSS file.

689
01:11:12,340 --> 01:11:13,060
Michael Kennedy: There's no build steps.

690
01:11:13,200 --> 01:11:15,020
Michael Kennedy: And then you just use utility classes there.

691
01:11:15,080 --> 01:11:16,380
Michael Kennedy: So it's plausible.

692
01:11:16,880 --> 01:11:17,360
Falko: Exactly.

693
01:11:17,500 --> 01:11:23,520
Falko: And because NiceGUI is pretty agnostic when it comes to classes, you can simply add classes to your elements.

694
01:11:23,840 --> 01:11:28,100
Falko: and then they will use Bulma if you loaded Bulma.

695
01:11:29,380 --> 01:11:31,040
Falko: So that's pretty easy.

696
01:11:32,040 --> 01:11:38,000
Falko: We can think about official support that you can switch between frameworks.

697
01:11:39,660 --> 01:11:42,260
Falko: Yeah, that could be a feature request we could be thinking about.

698
01:11:43,460 --> 01:11:56,960
Falko: The more difficult thing is replacing Quasar Of course, the Python implementation of these elements is pretty tightly coupled to the framework.

699
01:11:58,900 --> 01:12:04,080
Falko: Equator button behaves a bit differently than maybe some other button.

700
01:12:05,520 --> 01:12:09,400
Falko: That's where we would probably have to implement new elements.

701
01:12:12,460 --> 01:12:16,580
Falko: Maybe with a different name or we have to use some global switch.

702
01:12:17,580 --> 01:12:33,080
Falko: It is not planned right now, but it's not completely off the table because sometimes we get asked if we could get a more modern feel for NiceGUI apps and Quasar is already a bit dated.

703
01:12:33,760 --> 01:12:37,220
Falko: The material design is not the very newest.

704
01:12:38,760 --> 01:12:39,680
Michael Kennedy: I do like it though.

705
01:12:40,120 --> 01:12:42,140
Michael Kennedy: It looks clean and friendly.

706
01:12:42,260 --> 01:12:45,780
Falko: Yeah, especially if you deviate a little bit from the standards.

707
01:12:46,180 --> 01:12:54,900
Falko: If you remove the shadow, make sharp edges or something, which is pretty easy and nice to do globally, you can say all my buttons should have these props.

708
01:12:56,360 --> 01:13:00,000
Falko: Then you can build pretty nice apps, I guess, even with Quasar.

709
01:13:02,960 --> 01:13:52,800
Falko: But last days I spent so much time with Quasar Tailwind and their CSS layers because Tailwind before introduced CSS layers, or they don't introduce it, but they are using them right now. Quasar does not. And Quasar does its own things to make some statements more important than others. And it makes it pretty difficult to integrate with other frameworks. And I started to think about maybe removing Quasar, some in MySky four or five. But we'll have Maybe Quasar comes out with a new version with a better CSS layering strategy and maybe a new look and feel or maybe a better theming support.

710
01:13:54,660 --> 01:13:55,240
Michael Kennedy: Then it's back.

711
01:13:56,040 --> 01:13:56,140
Falko: Yeah.

712
01:13:56,740 --> 01:13:59,580
Falko: But a few weeks ago,

713
01:13:59,740 --> 01:14:06,960
Rodja: we had a pull request merged in where you could add very simply other frameworks on top of you

714
01:14:07,480 --> 01:14:08,900
Speaker 3: to put them in

715
01:14:09,220 --> 01:14:13,040
Rodja: and replace either the Quasar part completely.

716
01:14:13,180 --> 01:14:20,340
Rodja: then you cannot write UI button, but you can do it with the underlying mechanics of NiceGUI nonetheless.

717
01:14:21,700 --> 01:14:24,160
Rodja: But yeah, or you could use it as an addition.

718
01:14:25,200 --> 01:14:25,560
Michael Kennedy: - Yeah.

719
01:14:25,560 --> 01:14:25,580
Michael Kennedy: Yeah.

720
01:14:25,970 --> 01:14:27,700
Michael Kennedy: Just to be clear, I'm not saying you should be doing this.

721
01:14:27,840 --> 01:14:29,140
Rodja: Like you all wanna stay focused,

722
01:14:29,280 --> 01:14:30,160
Michael Kennedy: but I do think it's interesting.

723
01:14:30,400 --> 01:14:32,160
Rodja: You know, these people are all like,

724
01:14:32,190 --> 01:14:33,860
Michael Kennedy: hey, we're using this other thing.

725
01:14:33,930 --> 01:14:34,840
Michael Kennedy: And could we-

726
01:14:34,840 --> 01:14:37,260
Rodja: - There's so many features you could do.

727
01:14:37,260 --> 01:14:40,360
Rodja: And we need to decide, okay, what is going on?

728
01:14:40,360 --> 01:14:46,860
Rodja: What do we like and what do we not like, but also what comes from the community as feedback and as a feature request.

729
01:14:46,880 --> 01:15:05,100
Rodja: We cannot implement everything, but we really like to have a very feature rich and environment which doesn't constrain you so much, which allows you to deviate from the norm, find different aspects and evolve from that.

730
01:15:05,860 --> 01:15:06,080
Falko: - Yeah.

731
01:15:06,080 --> 01:15:13,720
Falko: And our main guideline is, would it be nice If another framework would be nice to have in NiceGuide, then we should maybe do it.

732
01:15:13,900 --> 01:15:16,420
Michael Kennedy: And we are always open to alternatives.

733
01:15:16,940 --> 01:15:17,380
Michael Kennedy: OK.

734
01:15:17,600 --> 01:15:17,960
Michael Kennedy: Sounds great.

735
01:15:18,120 --> 01:15:18,280
Michael Kennedy: All right.

736
01:15:18,640 --> 01:15:21,480
Michael Kennedy: Well, we're pretty much over time, so that means out of time.

737
01:15:22,700 --> 01:15:31,500
Michael Kennedy: Let's round this out with a quick question as sort of leading into the final call to action for people who are interested in the project.

738
01:15:31,780 --> 01:15:37,200
Michael Kennedy: So first of all, 14,000 GitHub stars, 830 forks.

739
01:15:37,420 --> 01:15:38,620
Michael Kennedy: You all must be super proud of that.

740
01:15:39,420 --> 01:15:42,040
Michael Kennedy: The other one is, are you looking for contributors?

741
01:15:42,900 --> 01:15:44,140
Michael Kennedy: What can people help with?

742
01:15:45,040 --> 01:15:46,160
Michael Kennedy: That kind of thing, right?

743
01:15:48,360 --> 01:15:53,300
Falko: Yeah, we are definitely always happy about any new contributors.

744
01:15:54,460 --> 01:15:59,840
Falko: We are always encouraging new users, new members of the community.

745
01:16:00,500 --> 01:16:05,320
Falko: If they have an idea how to improve it, we encourage them to, hey, do you want to make a pull request?

746
01:16:05,540 --> 01:16:09,080
Falko: Yeah, maybe it's the first one ever, but it's a great experience.

747
01:16:09,350 --> 01:16:11,400
Falko: And then you are an official NiceGUI contributor.

748
01:16:12,440 --> 01:16:18,280
Michael Kennedy: What kind of contributions would you want-- what would be most helpful from the community for you all?

749
01:16:18,780 --> 01:16:20,400
Falko: Versus maybe it's in certain areas, you're like,

750
01:16:20,520 --> 01:16:21,140
Michael Kennedy: it's so complicated.

751
01:16:21,560 --> 01:16:22,440
Michael Kennedy: Let us handle this part.

752
01:16:22,840 --> 01:16:23,720
Michael Kennedy: It has to be this way.

753
01:16:24,100 --> 01:16:25,100
Falko: That's a good question.

754
01:16:25,760 --> 01:16:29,560
Falko: And we don't have a really easy answer about it.

755
01:16:30,460 --> 01:16:48,320
Falko: There are parts where we reach the edge of our knowledge, where if, especially if users are scrolling through the open issues or pull requests and see some topic where they are maybe very experienced.

756
01:16:48,820 --> 01:16:59,060
Falko: And there are, we are trying to be very transparent about unsolved bugs or feature requests and where we don't know how to do it.

757
01:16:59,840 --> 01:17:19,560
Falko: And yeah, maybe even an open, an issue where we are still missing reproduction, something that's weird, but we can't reproduce it. Any step forward to solving these issues is helpful. Yeah, especially in areas where

758
01:17:19,600 --> 01:17:34,800
Michael Kennedy: we are out of knowledge. Yeah. All right. Sounds great. All right. Well, I guess we're going to leave it there with that. So final call to action. People want to get started with a NiceGUI. What

759
01:17:34,940 --> 01:18:11,300
Rodja: NiceGUI or ub install a NiceGUI and then launch it up write some code in it and feel free to to give us some notes and things what you would like to see but also just experiment with it and maybe it doesn't click with everyone and that's fine and maybe there are people who really much more like another framework or even write html and simply fast api but for those who who don't want to leave the environment with which are where they are very familiar with, I think Nysga is really a good starting point.

760
01:18:12,120 --> 01:18:12,980
Michael Kennedy: - Yeah, awesome.

761
01:18:13,320 --> 01:18:14,040
Michael Kennedy: Well, thank you so much.

762
01:18:14,780 --> 01:18:16,860
Michael Kennedy: Congratulations on the great project.

763
01:18:17,100 --> 01:18:19,880
Michael Kennedy: I know tons of people are getting lots of value.

764
01:18:20,140 --> 01:18:22,200
Michael Kennedy: So thanks for being on the show.

765
01:18:22,420 --> 01:18:23,640
Michael Kennedy: Thanks for creating it and sharing it.

766
01:18:24,140 --> 01:18:24,900
Rodja: - Yeah, thanks for having us.

767
01:18:25,160 --> 01:18:25,260
Rodja: - Thanks for having us.

768
01:18:25,260 --> 01:18:25,760
Rodja: - Thanks for having us.

769
01:18:26,340 --> 01:18:27,020
Michael Kennedy: - Yeah, see y'all.

770
01:18:27,600 --> 01:18:27,880
Rodja: - Bye.
