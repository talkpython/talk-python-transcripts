WEBVTT

00:00:01.659 --> 00:00:06.040
<v Michael Kennedy>Hello everyone, Sebastian, Patrick, Savannah, and Jonathan.

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:07.860
<v Michael Kennedy>Awesome to have you all here.

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:10.200
<v Michael Kennedy>Excited to talk about FastAPI Cloud.

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:11.140
<v Michael Kennedy>Welcome.

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:11.660
<v Michael Kennedy>Yes.

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:12.460
<v Michael Kennedy>Sorry.

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:17.720
<v Michael Kennedy>What a project.

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:19.540
<v Michael Kennedy>It's been going on for a while.

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:26.580
<v Michael Kennedy>I've heard stuff from Sebastian that maybe something was brewing and all these things,

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.180
<v Michael Kennedy>but not too long ago you all announced it.

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:34.780
<v Michael Kennedy>And I heard that FastAPI, some people have been using it recently.

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:38.580
<v Michael Kennedy>You know, some of the surveys show that some people use it for websites.

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:39.280
<v Michael Kennedy>I'm not sure.

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:42.660
<v Jonathan Ehwald>Rumors.

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:44.140
<v Michael Kennedy>Rumors.

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:45.420
<v Michael Kennedy>Rumors.

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:46.220
<v Michael Kennedy>Oh, my gosh.

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:48.400
<v Michael Kennedy>I mean, congratulations on that.

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:53.880
<v Michael Kennedy>But before we dive into FastAPI and FastAPI Cloud, let's just do a quick introduction.

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:55.260
<v Michael Kennedy>Who are you?

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:59.560
<v Michael Kennedy>We'll just go around the Brady Bunch squares of our live stream here and start with Sebastian.

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:01.820
<v Michael Kennedy>You've been on the show a few times.

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.580
<v Michael Kennedy>In fact, you've been on the show just recently for a really fun episode, Sebastian.

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:07.580
<v Sebastian Ramirez>Who are you?

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:08.740
<v Sebastian Ramirez>That was super fun.

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:10.200
<v Sebastian Ramirez>So hello, everyone.

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:12.380
<v Sebastian Ramirez>I'm Sebastian Ramirez or Tiangulo.

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.380
<v Sebastian Ramirez>I created FastAPI.

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:20.660
<v Sebastian Ramirez>That is this Python framework for building web APIs and backend in case you know.

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:24.100
<v Michael Kennedy>In case you've been living in a hole and haven't done any Python for 10 years.

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:32.640
<v Michael Kennedy>You also are famous for really pointing out the ridiculousness of modern tech recruiting.

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.140
<v Michael Kennedy>You know what I'm talking about?

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:37.500
<v Sebastian Ramirez>Yeah, you know, like it's fun.

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:44.800
<v Sebastian Ramirez>This is probably the thing that I am known for is for writing a tweet saying, yeah, that

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:53.659
<v Sebastian Ramirez>I saw a job post asking for five years of experience with API and I only had 2.5 since

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:54.520
<v Sebastian Ramirez>I created the thing.

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:58.040
<v Michael Kennedy>So you didn't qualify for the FastAPI job.

00:01:58.040 --> 00:01:59.280
<v Sebastian Ramirez>I didn't qualify for it, yeah.

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:06.220
<v Sebastian Ramirez>And then the funny thing is, you know, like people sometimes, even people in Python itself

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:09.820
<v Sebastian Ramirez>and tell me like, oh, wait, like you're, and I said like, oh, yeah, I created this thing

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:10.399
<v Sebastian Ramirez>called FastAPI.

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.100
<v Sebastian Ramirez>Oh, wait, okay, so what is FastAPI?

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:15.540
<v Sebastian Ramirez>Oh, wait, you are the guy from the meme.

00:02:16.799 --> 00:02:17.800
<v Sebastian Ramirez>Are you serious?

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:23.640
<v Sebastian Ramirez>Yeah, you know, like, suddenly that is super important that I am the guy for the meme of

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:27.220
<v Sebastian Ramirez>about FastAPI. Not the guy from Far of the Club, the guy from the.

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.720
<v Michael Kennedy>Israel, oh my gosh, I saw you on TikTok. It was amazing.

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:34.480
<v Sebastian Ramirez>It was my achievement. I wrote a viral tweet.

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:39.160
<v Michael Kennedy>You know what? Sometimes your moment in the sun is not the one you expected. No.

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:41.620
<v Michael Kennedy>Congratulations on how good FastAPI was.

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:41.900
<v Michael Kennedy>On the tweet.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.140
<v Michael Kennedy>Exactly. You really nailed it. Patrick, welcome to the show.

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:50.180
<v Patrick Arminio>Hello. Thank you. It's nice to be here. Yeah, I'm Patrick.

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:55.220
<v Patrick Arminio>I guess the main thing I'm kind of known for in the community is like this library called

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:59.400
<v Patrick Arminio>Storary, which is pretty similar to FastAPI, but instead of REST is for GraphQL.

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:06.240
<v Patrick Arminio>Other than that, I help organize PyCon Italy and I used to also do EuroPython as well,

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:08.860
<v Patrick Arminio>but I stopped because of way too many things.

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:11.980
<v Patrick Arminio>Yeah, that's pretty much me.

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:12.560
<v Michael Kennedy>Okay.

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:13.740
<v Michael Kennedy>Yeah, that's awesome.

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:16.920
<v Michael Kennedy>How do you see GraphQL these days?

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:18.540
<v Michael Kennedy>Is it still popular?

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:24.340
<v Patrick Arminio>I think it's mostly popular in the enterprises, unfortunately.

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:29.700
<v Patrick Arminio>To be honest, I'm a bit annoyed about the companies that do tooling around GraphQL because

00:03:30.879 --> 00:03:32.960
<v Patrick Arminio>they're not really pushing it forward.

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:36.520
<v Patrick Arminio>They're just trying to work with enterprises and that's it.

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:38.720
<v Patrick Arminio>Or maybe you're putting to AI.

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:43.600
<v Michael Kennedy>Yeah, it feels a little bit like the soap.

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:48.120
<v Michael Kennedy>The soap with the XML modern version.

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:49.240
<v Michael Kennedy>Savannah.

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:51.380
<v Michael Kennedy>Yeah.

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:58.000
<v Savannah Ostrowski>I was just going to say that I think you like tapping out of being an organizer for EuroPython

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:03.460
<v Savannah Ostrowski>is like, you know, the classic open source oversubscribed doing all the things.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:04.540
<v Savannah Ostrowski>Very relatable.

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:07.780
<v Savannah Ostrowski>Yeah.

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:08.600
<v Savannah Ostrowski>Yeah.

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:10.100
<v Savannah Ostrowski>But yeah, I'm Savannah.

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:13.060
<v Savannah Ostrowski>What can I say?

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:18.560
<v Savannah Ostrowski>I am on the Python Steering Council for 2026, which is very exciting.

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:26.980
<v Savannah Ostrowski>I am also the release manager for the upcoming version of Python, Python 3.16.

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:32.320
<v Savannah Ostrowski>And so that'll kick off later this year, which is really cool and very exciting.

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:40.380
<v Savannah Ostrowski>I work on CPython stuff, the JIT, arg parse, basically whatever needs help is kind of where

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:40.880
<v Savannah Ostrowski>you'll find me.

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:42.280
<v Michael Kennedy>Awesome.

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:44.420
<v Michael Kennedy>Congratulations on the steering council.

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:47.900
<v Michael Kennedy>And yeah, that's a lot of cool stuff.

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:53.980
<v Michael Kennedy>Hopefully we don't get a Python 4.0 right after 3.16

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:57.260
<v Michael Kennedy>because then your job will never end is what I've learned.

00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:58.260
<v Savannah Ostrowski>Yeah, yeah.

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:02.580
<v Savannah Ostrowski>Benjamin Peterson, Python 2.7 forever kind of situation.

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:03.520
<v Savannah Ostrowski>Yeah, yeah.

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:07.620
<v Savannah Ostrowski>I mean, release management is still, I mean, it's still quite a commitment.

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:11.799
<v Savannah Ostrowski>It's like seven-ish years when you think about all the staggered releases

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:12.940
<v Savannah Ostrowski>to your release management too.

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:15.520
<v Savannah Ostrowski>And then you have the five year maintenance cycle.

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:20.740
<v Savannah Ostrowski>So yeah, it's Python forever is what I can really say.

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:22.840
<v Michael Kennedy>- Yeah, it's probably not a fad.

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:24.520
<v Michael Kennedy>It's probably gonna stick around this Python thing.

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:28.620
<v Michael Kennedy>No, that's awesome. Congratulations.

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:31.160
<v Michael Kennedy>Also cool with argpars.

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:34.100
<v Michael Kennedy>I feel like that's making a strong comeback now

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:39.299
<v Michael Kennedy>that we have these AI things that can just

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:42.560
<v Michael Kennedy>put stuff together for us instead of like,

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:44.400
<v Michael Kennedy>oh, I need to depend on this library and that library.

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:47.140
<v Michael Kennedy>I just need to take a few arguments

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:48.380
<v Michael Kennedy>and have a little help text.

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:50.300
<v Michael Kennedy>And it's like, well, you've already got this built-in thing.

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:51.880
<v Michael Kennedy>Oh, who knew?

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:53.480
<v Michael Kennedy>People were like, oh, I didn't even know.

00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:56.380
<v Michael Kennedy>I thought I used typer or click or something, right?

00:05:57.140 --> 00:05:59.480
<v Savannah Ostrowski>- Yeah, I mean, I was gonna say,

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:02.440
<v Savannah Ostrowski>there's the typers and clicks of the world,

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:04.820
<v Savannah Ostrowski>but sometimes you just want the simplest thing

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:06.800
<v Savannah Ostrowski>and ArgParse is pretty great at that,

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:09.580
<v Savannah Ostrowski>although it has many quirks that are probably

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:12.160
<v Savannah Ostrowski>and most definitely unfixable at this point

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:14.980
<v Savannah Ostrowski>because bugs are features when you have things

00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:16.320
<v Savannah Ostrowski>that have been around as long as Python.

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:20.720
<v Savannah Ostrowski>But yeah, no, I mean, AI loves to write Python.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.340
<v Savannah Ostrowski>I think it's like the language used the most

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:26.240
<v Savannah Ostrowski>in AI generated code, so.

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:29.180
<v Michael Kennedy>- Yeah, I'll just say we live in weird times.

00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:30.320
<v Michael Kennedy>We live in very weird times.

00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:33.160
<v Savannah Ostrowski>- I would love a precedented time at some time.

00:06:33.220 --> 00:06:33.960
<v Michael Kennedy>- Exactly, yeah.

00:06:34.130 --> 00:06:35.460
<v Michael Kennedy>Can we just get the boring times?

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:37.440
<v Michael Kennedy>Nothing interesting, please.

00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:38.400
<v Savannah Ostrowski>Yeah.

00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:39.280
<v Michael Kennedy>All right.

00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:45.680
<v Michael Kennedy>Oh, also, I did what I said about GraphQL may sound like a bit of a smash,

00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:49.760
<v Michael Kennedy>but I didn't mean it in a negative, super negative way anyway.

00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:54.240
<v Michael Kennedy>Like, it used to be all the enterprises were all about SOAP and Wisdle

00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:55.760
<v Michael Kennedy>and, like, subscribing your tooling.

00:06:57.240 --> 00:06:57.980
<v Michael Kennedy>Please don't write me.

00:06:58.030 --> 00:06:59.520
<v Michael Kennedy>I'm not trying to bash on your technology.

00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:02.220
<v Michael Kennedy>All right.

00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:04.160
<v Michael Kennedy>Jonathan, also, welcome.

00:07:04.410 --> 00:07:04.520
<v Michael Kennedy>Hi.

00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:05.600
<v Jonathan Ehwald>Hi.

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:10.060
<v Jonathan Ehwald>Yeah, I'm not nearly as famous as everyone else in this call.

00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:17.040
<v Jonathan Ehwald>I'm more infamous internally at FastAPI Cloud, I would say, for a bunch of things.

00:07:17.580 --> 00:07:20.300
<v Michael Kennedy>I've heard of emojis or something along the lines.

00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:20.660
<v Michael Kennedy>One meme away.

00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:21.980
<v Sebastian Ramirez>You're just one meme away.

00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:23.380
<v Jonathan Ehwald>Just one meme away.

00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:24.420
<v Jonathan Ehwald>Yeah, that's true.

00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:26.500
<v Jonathan Ehwald>We keep piling them up internally.

00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:32.440
<v Jonathan Ehwald>But yeah, I used to work with Patrick together for years, also on CraftGuard.

00:07:33.140 --> 00:07:33.720
<v Jonathan Ehwald>Same like we assume.

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:35.540
<v Jonathan Ehwald>That's how I know him.

00:07:35.820 --> 00:07:40.060
<v Jonathan Ehwald>And that's why I, well, made a weird sound when you said so.

00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:47.780
<v Jonathan Ehwald>Yeah, and I've been with FastAPI Cloud since EuropePython, actually, the last one.

00:07:48.440 --> 00:07:52.100
<v Jonathan Ehwald>I promised Sebastian I would implement some Ascent events in FastAPI,

00:07:52.100 --> 00:07:58.180
<v Jonathan Ehwald>and I haven't started with it yet at all, but somehow I'm still here.

00:07:58.240 --> 00:07:58.760
<v Jonathan Ehwald>So that's great.

00:08:00.900 --> 00:08:05.300
<v Sebastian Ramirez>Well, actually, and that's actually like a sneak peek, I guess.

00:08:05.340 --> 00:08:10.160
<v Sebastian Ramirez>we already started like having a bunch of chats and like discussing what we do should we do it

00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:14.460
<v Sebastian Ramirez>here should we do it there what should we do so like yeah it's something that is coming to fast

00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:20.480
<v Sebastian Ramirez>api probably soonish like there was a lot of things that needed to happen before that like

00:08:20.900 --> 00:08:27.300
<v Sebastian Ramirez>the patrick is slightly smiley like oh no this is pressure there were some things that needed to

00:08:27.380 --> 00:08:31.480
<v Sebastian Ramirez>happen in fast api like you know dropping support for findante version one or things like that that

00:08:31.500 --> 00:08:33.960
<v Sebastian Ramirez>that just made the code, the internal code, so complex.

00:08:34.500 --> 00:08:37.740
<v Sebastian Ramirez>And now that it's over, we can actually work more

00:08:37.940 --> 00:08:39.800
<v Sebastian Ramirez>on improving performance, adding features,

00:08:39.969 --> 00:08:40.680
<v Sebastian Ramirez>and things like that.

00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:41.200
<v Sebastian Ramirez>So yeah.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:44.080
<v Michael Kennedy>Yeah, very exciting.

00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:51.060
<v Michael Kennedy>I definitely want to dive into how FastAPI Cloud

00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:56.660
<v Michael Kennedy>has sort of influenced the whole FastAPI side of things.

00:08:57.360 --> 00:09:03.000
<v Michael Kennedy>But I'm made aware that there is, in fact, an entire website.

00:09:05.980 --> 00:09:08.120
<v Michael Kennedy>An entire website dedicated to the meme.

00:09:08.940 --> 00:09:09.480
<v Michael Kennedy>All right.

00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:13.560
<v Michael Kennedy>Yeah, and out of the audience we get, hey, everyone, is that the guy from the meme?

00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:16.580
<v Michael Kennedy>And the meme is greater than Nobel Prize.

00:09:17.080 --> 00:09:19.020
<v Michael Kennedy>So, you know what?

00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:20.280
<v Michael Kennedy>It may be true.

00:09:20.620 --> 00:09:21.160
<v Michael Kennedy>It may be true.

00:09:21.220 --> 00:09:24.660
<v Sebastian Ramirez>I recognize the person saying, this is the guy from the meme.

00:09:24.840 --> 00:09:25.980
<v Savannah Ostrowski>He might be my husband.

00:09:31.300 --> 00:09:38.760
<v Michael Kennedy>incredible incredible all right well let's start with fast api cloud and then we'll bring it back

00:09:38.980 --> 00:09:45.540
<v Michael Kennedy>around to the fast api let's let's talk org origin story so what is this fast api cloud

00:09:47.380 --> 00:09:51.899
<v Sebastian Ramirez>nice so uh here we're looking at the fast api labs website that doesn't really show

00:09:52.100 --> 00:09:56.700
<v Sebastian Ramirez>that much. If you click on the join the waiting list that takes you to the website for FastAPI

00:09:56.840 --> 00:10:01.780
<v Sebastian Ramirez>Cloud, there we can see like this is what we are building. This is the thing that we are doing.

00:10:02.620 --> 00:10:07.280
<v Sebastian Ramirez>It's actually super simple. The funny thing is that the pitch, the explanation of the product

00:10:07.540 --> 00:10:13.920
<v Sebastian Ramirez>is so short. So it's one command. It's FastAPI Deploy. And you have a FastAPI app, you just hit

00:10:13.980 --> 00:10:18.380
<v Sebastian Ramirez>FastAPI Deploy, and then it's on the cloud. We take care of everything. We build a thing,

00:10:19.420 --> 00:10:23.180
<v Sebastian Ramirez>deploy it, handle HTTPS, auto-scaling, all this stuff.

00:10:23.700 --> 00:10:27.460
<v Sebastian Ramirez>And then you can just focus on building the application, building apps.

00:10:28.420 --> 00:10:30.500
<v Sebastian Ramirez>The funny thing is that it's super short to explain,

00:10:30.500 --> 00:10:32.560
<v Sebastian Ramirez>but then building it is so complex.

00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:38.500
<v Michael Kennedy>I feel, well, first of all, I'm glad it's so short.

00:10:38.580 --> 00:10:39.460
<v Michael Kennedy>So thanks for being here.

00:10:39.480 --> 00:10:40.440
<v Michael Kennedy>That was a great show, y'all.

00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:41.540
<v Michael Kennedy>Well, I'm just kidding.

00:10:44.360 --> 00:10:49.240
<v Michael Kennedy>No, I think it's a little bit like Jupyter Notebooks.

00:10:49.320 --> 00:10:56.000
<v Michael Kennedy>in that sense that like you all are taking one for the team so that other people can have a simple

00:10:56.340 --> 00:11:01.580
<v Michael Kennedy>experience whereas you know it's like those those jupyter folks they write tons of typescript and

00:11:01.580 --> 00:11:06.140
<v Michael Kennedy>do all sorts of things that nobody wants to necessarily do in the data science space so that

00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:14.319
<v Sebastian Ramirez>you can just drag your widgets around you know what i mean um exactly yeah yeah yeah thanks i feel

00:11:14.340 --> 00:11:22.500
<v Michael Kennedy>like no i was just i feel like the deployment space it's a bit of a mixed bag and it's my i've

00:11:22.580 --> 00:11:28.220
<v Michael Kennedy>been really frustrated to the point such that i wrote a book about it that i think about an

00:11:28.380 --> 00:11:36.180
<v Michael Kennedy>alternative that i think over the last five plus years it's just trended towards a little more

00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:41.219
<v Michael Kennedy>complex a little more complex oh could we just add one of these things and oh now we got these

00:11:41.240 --> 00:11:45.160
<v Michael Kennedy>through we need one more thing to like make sure those things are doing you know what i mean and

00:11:45.220 --> 00:11:52.080
<v Michael Kennedy>it's just like wow why are there 200 choices in my console to use this which is like kind of funny

00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:57.000
<v Savannah Ostrowski>right because i feel like a lot of these companies started with this like i don't want to understand

00:11:57.260 --> 00:12:01.380
<v Savannah Ostrowski>all the ins and outs of all the infrastructure that comes with the cloud service provider and

00:12:01.480 --> 00:12:04.759
<v Savannah Ostrowski>that's really complicated to understand because i'm an app dev and i don't know anything about

00:12:05.020 --> 00:12:11.060
<v Savannah Ostrowski>never, right? And now we're like, I don't know, kind of slowly accumulating complexity. But I

00:12:11.070 --> 00:12:15.620
<v Savannah Ostrowski>think one of the cool things about what we're building, and I like I've worked on cloud tooling

00:12:15.790 --> 00:12:20.540
<v Savannah Ostrowski>before is like, this is like, just spoke for Python developers. And I think that's like,

00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:26.540
<v Savannah Ostrowski>quite, like unique in that, like, we are really trying to like, bring the bleeding edge and like

00:12:26.620 --> 00:12:34.740
<v Savannah Ostrowski>all the new tooling that people are using and making sure that we play well with like uv. And

00:12:34.740 --> 00:12:37.480
<v Savannah Ostrowski>care put into that by the team.

00:12:37.660 --> 00:12:39.240
<v Michael Kennedy>Yeah. That's a super good point.

00:12:39.300 --> 00:12:43.400
<v Michael Kennedy>I mean, I remember Azure came out with like,

00:12:43.480 --> 00:12:44.640
<v Michael Kennedy>here's your platform as a service.

00:12:44.860 --> 00:12:47.440
<v Michael Kennedy>You just upload your web app and we'll just take it and go.

00:12:47.660 --> 00:12:50.960
<v Michael Kennedy>And now that thing is so complicated along with many, many others.

00:12:51.180 --> 00:12:51.940
<v Michael Kennedy>It's not just them.

00:12:52.040 --> 00:12:55.120
<v Michael Kennedy>It's you've got AWS, you've got Vercel.

00:12:55.220 --> 00:12:57.440
<v Michael Kennedy>There's lots of things we could point at for,

00:12:58.540 --> 00:12:59.380
<v Michael Kennedy>there's a lot of options here.

00:13:00.820 --> 00:13:02.620
<v Sebastian Ramirez>And then there are a lot of tools and like,

00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:07.500
<v Sebastian Ramirez>You know, like many tools and many companies are also doing a great job at many of the things that they are doing.

00:13:08.100 --> 00:13:09.840
<v Sebastian Ramirez>But in many cases, it's just so complex.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:10.700
<v Sebastian Ramirez>It's so complicated.

00:13:10.920 --> 00:13:19.340
<v Sebastian Ramirez>You know, like I was I have always been so adamant, I think is the word, to just teaching people how to use the tools.

00:13:19.920 --> 00:13:25.980
<v Sebastian Ramirez>I think I have the most documentation about how to deploy things on your own than any other framework.

00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:27.440
<v Sebastian Ramirez>I have so much information.

00:13:27.960 --> 00:13:29.520
<v Michael Kennedy>I hear that all the time from people.

00:13:29.800 --> 00:13:32.060
<v Michael Kennedy>they say one of the reasons they chose FastAPI

00:13:32.080 --> 00:13:34.360
<v Michael Kennedy>is because how clear the documentation was, you know?

00:13:35.319 --> 00:13:37.840
<v Sebastian Ramirez>- Yeah, and then the thing is, you know,

00:13:37.960 --> 00:13:39.780
<v Sebastian Ramirez>like just learning all those concepts

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.520
<v Sebastian Ramirez>and like learning all this stuff that needs to be learned

00:13:42.820 --> 00:13:43.700
<v Sebastian Ramirez>just to deploy something

00:13:43.820 --> 00:13:45.860
<v Sebastian Ramirez>and then just you barely have like the minimum.

00:13:46.500 --> 00:13:48.660
<v Sebastian Ramirez>It's like, this is, you know, like it's just too much.

00:13:48.780 --> 00:13:49.800
<v Sebastian Ramirez>It's too much complexity.

00:13:50.480 --> 00:13:54.560
<v Sebastian Ramirez>I think for me, like I guess like personally,

00:13:54.880 --> 00:13:58.719
<v Sebastian Ramirez>my analogy is that FastAPI Cloud is the equivalent

00:13:58.740 --> 00:14:02.600
<v Sebastian Ramirez>of what FastAPI is to building web APIs and backend.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:04.340
<v Sebastian Ramirez>You know, like you could do the same

00:14:04.600 --> 00:14:05.340
<v Sebastian Ramirez>with any other framework.

00:14:05.400 --> 00:14:07.920
<v Sebastian Ramirez>You could validate data, you could generate open API,

00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:09.240
<v Sebastian Ramirez>you could have automatic docs,

00:14:09.840 --> 00:14:12.560
<v Sebastian Ramirez>but you will probably have to do a lot of the wiring yourself

00:14:13.300 --> 00:14:14.640
<v Sebastian Ramirez>and making sure that it's actually correct

00:14:14.880 --> 00:14:16.640
<v Sebastian Ramirez>and that it doesn't explode, all the stuff.

00:14:17.360 --> 00:14:22.540
<v Sebastian Ramirez>That is, you know, like we are trying to do a lot of that work

00:14:23.019 --> 00:14:24.280
<v Sebastian Ramirez>for the final users.

00:14:26.339 --> 00:14:27.640
<v Michael Kennedy>- Yeah, and I think it's great.

00:14:28.280 --> 00:14:33.220
<v Michael Kennedy>I think it's really nice to just provide this on-ramp

00:14:33.420 --> 00:14:36.220
<v Michael Kennedy>because as you said at the opening,

00:14:36.360 --> 00:14:38.120
<v Michael Kennedy>when I asked the origin story,

00:14:38.280 --> 00:14:42.660
<v Michael Kennedy>it's just FastAPI deploy, right?

00:14:43.300 --> 00:14:45.000
<v Michael Kennedy>That solves so many stories.

00:14:45.120 --> 00:14:46.360
<v Michael Kennedy>And I'm sure behind the scenes,

00:14:46.460 --> 00:14:49.740
<v Michael Kennedy>what happens is just about as simple as that.

00:14:51.520 --> 00:14:52.180
<v Michael Kennedy>Oh, my gosh.

00:14:52.840 --> 00:14:53.520
<v Jonathan Ehwald>About that.

00:14:56.800 --> 00:15:00.400
<v Jonathan Ehwald>Some of us don't even get to write Python anymore to make all of this happen.

00:15:01.920 --> 00:15:03.560
<v Jonathan Ehwald>I'm taking one for the team.

00:15:05.540 --> 00:15:07.100
<v Michael Kennedy>Yeah, that is taking one for our team, right?

00:15:07.920 --> 00:15:08.440
<v Jonathan Ehwald>It is.

00:15:09.240 --> 00:15:09.320
<v Michael Kennedy>Yeah.

00:15:11.560 --> 00:15:14.000
<v Michael Kennedy>Let's save the internals for a little bit later.

00:15:14.360 --> 00:15:19.000
<v Michael Kennedy>Maybe what we could do right now, maybe we could do a bit of a walkthrough

00:15:19.940 --> 00:15:26.660
<v Michael Kennedy>of just kind of what it's like to set up an app from scratch, right?

00:15:27.700 --> 00:15:28.020
<v Michael Kennedy>Nice.

00:15:28.120 --> 00:15:31.280
<v Michael Kennedy>I see that uv is here, which is,

00:15:32.080 --> 00:15:39.000
<v Michael Kennedy>I've been certainly an advocate for uv in all sorts of deployment,

00:15:39.020 --> 00:15:42.860
<v Michael Kennedy>but especially when you have like repeated build type of scenarios

00:15:43.100 --> 00:15:46.900
<v Michael Kennedy>for like Docker, Docker Compose or Kubernetes or whatever.

00:15:47.400 --> 00:15:50.620
<v Michael Kennedy>UV makes that stuff so much faster and so on.

00:15:50.740 --> 00:15:54.460
<v Michael Kennedy>So who would like to be my guide that just kind of talks us through what it

00:15:54.580 --> 00:15:56.100
<v Michael Kennedy>means to set up a new project here?

00:15:58.320 --> 00:15:58.680
<v Sebastian Ramirez>Patrick.

00:15:59.480 --> 00:15:59.620
<v Sebastian Ramirez>Yeah.

00:16:00.180 --> 00:16:01.460
<v Sebastian Ramirez>I feel like it should be Patrick.

00:16:02.440 --> 00:16:04.520
<v Patrick Arminio>That was great to suggest, Lavana, but I can.

00:16:05.620 --> 00:16:06.400
<v Patrick Arminio>I've talked enough.

00:16:06.560 --> 00:16:07.060
<v Savannah Ostrowski>I feel like.

00:16:07.760 --> 00:16:08.880
<v Sebastian Ramirez>Patrick has the best mic.

00:16:10.460 --> 00:16:10.800
<v Patrick Arminio>Oh, yeah.

00:16:11.200 --> 00:16:11.580
<v Patrick Arminio>That's the reason.

00:16:11.740 --> 00:16:12.180
<v Patrick Arminio>That could be.

00:16:13.420 --> 00:16:13.580
<v Patrick Arminio>Yeah.

00:16:14.380 --> 00:16:15.600
<v Patrick Arminio>I mean, do you want to go from scratch?

00:16:15.760 --> 00:16:19.680
<v Patrick Arminio>I mean, there is this really nice command that Savannah built,

00:16:19.920 --> 00:16:23.200
<v Patrick Arminio>which is FastAPI-new, which I think is something, I don't know,

00:16:25.010 --> 00:16:25.740
<v Patrick Arminio>super helpful.

00:16:27.740 --> 00:16:30.020
<v Michael Kennedy>Yeah, so what does FastAPI-new do?

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:35.020
<v Michael Kennedy>Is that kind of a cookie-cutter-esque experience, or what is it?

00:16:35.800 --> 00:16:36.360
<v Patrick Arminio>Yes, exactly.

00:16:36.580 --> 00:16:41.320
<v Patrick Arminio>At the moment, Onesco holds a super basic FastAPI application using uv.

00:16:41.660 --> 00:16:44.400
<v Patrick Arminio>It also installs dependencies, creates a folder, everything that you need.

00:16:46.220 --> 00:16:49.040
<v Patrick Arminio>In future, I think we're going to plan support for templates

00:16:49.300 --> 00:16:51.880
<v Patrick Arminio>so you can build multiple kind of things as well.

00:16:52.530 --> 00:16:55.180
<v Patrick Arminio>But for now, it's basically just uv FastAPI new,

00:16:55.560 --> 00:16:56.980
<v Patrick Arminio>sorry, uvx FastAPI new,

00:16:57.420 --> 00:16:59.040
<v Patrick Arminio>and then that scaffolds the project for you.

00:17:00.560 --> 00:17:03.360
<v Patrick Arminio>I don't know if you want to try it live or...

00:17:04.040 --> 00:17:04.800
<v Michael Kennedy>No, go ahead.

00:17:05.380 --> 00:17:06.260
<v Michael Kennedy>Let's just...

00:17:06.579 --> 00:17:08.240
<v Michael Kennedy>I think it might have disrupted you.

00:17:08.240 --> 00:17:09.280
<v Michael Kennedy>Just let's talk us through it.

00:17:12.140 --> 00:17:13.180
<v Jonathan Ehwald>It could work.

00:17:13.240 --> 00:17:15.000
<v Jonathan Ehwald>I'm just going to put that out there.

00:17:15.180 --> 00:17:15.760
<v Jonathan Ehwald>I'm sure.

00:17:16.439 --> 00:17:16.819
<v Jonathan Ehwald>I'm sure.

00:17:17.160 --> 00:17:18.699
<v Jonathan Ehwald>I've had a few times recently.

00:17:19.939 --> 00:17:21.079
<v Michael Kennedy>I started to do...

00:17:22.160 --> 00:17:23.620
<v Michael Kennedy>I'll tell you the most insane,

00:17:23.959 --> 00:17:25.939
<v Michael Kennedy>like let's do that live on the podcast experience.

00:17:26.140 --> 00:17:26.860
<v Michael Kennedy>I'm pretty sure,

00:17:27.600 --> 00:17:29.160
<v Michael Kennedy>yeah, this is definitely the most insane.

00:17:29.740 --> 00:17:31.760
<v Michael Kennedy>I had Matthew Rocklin on from Coiled

00:17:32.320 --> 00:17:34.100
<v Michael Kennedy>and those guys are all about like,

00:17:34.100 --> 00:17:35.080
<v Michael Kennedy>hey, we're going to scale up

00:17:35.140 --> 00:17:37.660
<v Michael Kennedy>like a bunch of available servers for you, right?

00:17:38.160 --> 00:17:39.440
<v Michael Kennedy>So that you can do your data science.

00:17:39.500 --> 00:17:41.140
<v Michael Kennedy>Like I want to do some ML thing

00:17:41.140 --> 00:17:42.520
<v Michael Kennedy>and it needs 500 servers.

00:17:43.160 --> 00:17:47.020
<v Michael Kennedy>So during the podcast, he said, oh, let me just spin up 2,000 EC2 instances.

00:17:47.300 --> 00:17:47.500
<v Michael Kennedy>Hold on.

00:17:48.480 --> 00:17:50.520
<v Michael Kennedy>And then we ran some code on it during the show.

00:17:50.600 --> 00:17:51.720
<v Michael Kennedy>And he's like, oh, let's try that on ARM.

00:17:51.800 --> 00:17:54.560
<v Michael Kennedy>And then spin up another 2,000 on ARM Linux machines.

00:17:54.700 --> 00:17:55.700
<v Michael Kennedy>I'm like, okay, that's nuts.

00:17:57.180 --> 00:17:57.940
<v Michael Kennedy>But let's just...

00:17:58.320 --> 00:17:58.980
<v Michael Kennedy>That's a lot of time.

00:18:00.820 --> 00:18:01.280
<v Michael Kennedy>I was impressed.

00:18:01.620 --> 00:18:03.860
<v Michael Kennedy>But Patrick, sorry.

00:18:04.200 --> 00:18:04.960
<v Michael Kennedy>I had a debrief there.

00:18:05.540 --> 00:18:06.020
<v Michael Kennedy>Let's talk through it.

00:18:07.300 --> 00:18:10.160
<v Patrick Arminio>Yeah, so you do uvx FastAPI new.

00:18:10.600 --> 00:18:12.580
<v Patrick Arminio>Then you specify the name of the application.

00:18:13.160 --> 00:18:14.480
<v Patrick Arminio>and that's almost there.

00:18:14.480 --> 00:18:16.580
<v Patrick Arminio>You just need one more command to deploy,

00:18:16.940 --> 00:18:17.700
<v Patrick Arminio>which is FastAPI deploy.

00:18:18.780 --> 00:18:20.220
<v Patrick Arminio>The first time it's going to ask you to log in

00:18:20.660 --> 00:18:22.900
<v Patrick Arminio>or join the waiting list if you haven't been invited yet.

00:18:23.320 --> 00:18:24.320
<v Patrick Arminio>So you're still in beta.

00:18:25.980 --> 00:18:27.400
<v Patrick Arminio>And then you follow the steps.

00:18:27.690 --> 00:18:29.760
<v Patrick Arminio>So like FastAPI deploy, log in,

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:33.580
<v Patrick Arminio>decide the team, if you have multiple teams,

00:18:34.740 --> 00:18:35.860
<v Patrick Arminio>decide the application name,

00:18:36.780 --> 00:18:38.200
<v Patrick Arminio>and then you wait a few seconds

00:18:38.460 --> 00:18:39.580
<v Patrick Arminio>and the application is going to be live.

00:18:40.740 --> 00:18:42.100
<v Patrick Arminio>And just to be clear,

00:18:42.220 --> 00:18:46.320
<v Savannah Ostrowski>FastAPI new is not required if you already have a FastAPI app.

00:18:46.570 --> 00:18:49.640
<v Savannah Ostrowski>Like if you've already written your own code and you have your application,

00:18:50.280 --> 00:18:53.020
<v Savannah Ostrowski>you can just go right into like logging in and deploying.

00:18:53.540 --> 00:18:56.160
<v Savannah Ostrowski>This is just so that if you're starting something new,

00:18:56.600 --> 00:18:59.980
<v Savannah Ostrowski>you don't have to do any thinking about all the right things that need to be there.

00:19:00.150 --> 00:19:02.060
<v Savannah Ostrowski>So this is more of a green field application.

00:19:02.500 --> 00:19:04.140
<v Savannah Ostrowski>I'm bootstrapping a project.

00:19:04.640 --> 00:19:07.800
<v Michael Kennedy>Right, right, because you want to have the best structure.

00:19:08.620 --> 00:19:10.120
<v Michael Kennedy>Now it uses uv.

00:19:11.340 --> 00:19:13.420
<v Michael Kennedy>So do I have to use--

00:19:13.420 --> 00:19:14.020
<v Michael Kennedy>You can use required.

00:19:14.720 --> 00:19:17.220
<v Michael Kennedy>Yeah, I was going to say, do I have to use the uv project

00:19:17.540 --> 00:19:18.420
<v Michael Kennedy>management type of thing?

00:19:18.700 --> 00:19:23.540
<v Michael Kennedy>Do I have to use the uv.lock files and uv add uv sync?

00:19:23.800 --> 00:19:24.920
<v Michael Kennedy>Can I do requirements.txt?

00:19:25.060 --> 00:19:25.820
<v Michael Kennedy>What's the story there?

00:19:26.559 --> 00:19:29.740
<v Patrick Arminio>Yeah, so we support uv with uv lock.

00:19:29.880 --> 00:19:31.300
<v Patrick Arminio>We also support the--

00:19:31.380 --> 00:19:33.300
<v Patrick Arminio>forget the name-- the PyLock file.

00:19:33.700 --> 00:19:36.140
<v Patrick Arminio>And we also support plain requirements.txt.

00:19:36.740 --> 00:19:38.980
<v Patrick Arminio>And maybe something else I don't know Jonathan can use.

00:19:39.060 --> 00:19:40.020
<v Michael Kennedy>PyLock's pretty new, right?

00:19:40.200 --> 00:19:42.820
<v Michael Kennedy>I think Brett Cannon just got that out pretty recently, right?

00:19:43.400 --> 00:19:43.620
<v Sebastian Ramirez>- Yeah.

00:19:44.730 --> 00:19:46.220
<v Savannah Ostrowski>- Brett was pretty excited, I think.

00:19:46.420 --> 00:19:46.720
<v Michael Kennedy>- I know.

00:19:47.080 --> 00:19:48.460
<v Savannah Ostrowski>- He implemented that.

00:19:48.780 --> 00:19:49.180
<v Michael Kennedy>- Oh, was he?

00:19:49.370 --> 00:19:50.600
<v Michael Kennedy>Okay, I'm sure he was, that's awesome.

00:19:50.780 --> 00:19:52.300
<v Michael Kennedy>He put years of work into that.

00:19:53.020 --> 00:19:53.500
<v Savannah Ostrowski>- Sure did.

00:19:53.550 --> 00:19:53.640
<v Michael Kennedy>- Yeah.

00:19:55.100 --> 00:19:57.100
<v Sebastian Ramirez>I can also say that one of the motivations

00:19:57.400 --> 00:19:59.660
<v Sebastian Ramirez>was also like, you know, like cloud providers.

00:20:00.100 --> 00:20:02.440
<v Sebastian Ramirez>So it's like, yes, we did it.

00:20:03.240 --> 00:20:03.520
<v Sebastian Ramirez>- Okay.

00:20:03.580 --> 00:20:04.760
<v Sebastian Ramirez>- The other thing is like, you know,

00:20:04.900 --> 00:20:07.000
<v Sebastian Ramirez>if you use other different package managers,

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:10.980
<v Sebastian Ramirez>if they use the standard PI project, the Tomo format,

00:20:11.360 --> 00:20:12.240
<v Sebastian Ramirez>that will also be supported.

00:20:13.760 --> 00:20:16.400
<v Sebastian Ramirez>That means that, you know, like if you use PDM

00:20:16.520 --> 00:20:19.660
<v Sebastian Ramirez>or if you use poetry with one of the recent versions,

00:20:20.080 --> 00:20:20.820
<v Sebastian Ramirez>like that will work.

00:20:21.120 --> 00:20:23.040
<v Sebastian Ramirez>If you use a very old version of poetry

00:20:23.360 --> 00:20:25.660
<v Sebastian Ramirez>or like you use some other strange package manager

00:20:25.720 --> 00:20:27.660
<v Sebastian Ramirez>or something that will probably be problematic.

00:20:28.220 --> 00:20:30.820
<v Sebastian Ramirez>But for like most of the use cases

00:20:30.960 --> 00:20:33.840
<v Sebastian Ramirez>that use the standard package formats, it will just work.

00:20:34.640 --> 00:20:35.460
<v Sebastian Ramirez>And if you use uv,

00:20:35.820 --> 00:20:43.820
<v Sebastian Ramirez>like you're gonna have the best experience because we are fans of uv and astra yeah they've definitely

00:20:44.240 --> 00:20:49.800
<v Michael Kennedy>put a dent in the way that sort of python gets started and making that a lot easier so it totally

00:20:49.940 --> 00:20:56.880
<v Michael Kennedy>makes sense and also i noticed speaking of uv that there's at least in the recommended way

00:20:57.780 --> 00:21:04.160
<v Michael Kennedy>or over the way in the docs let's say it doesn't say here's how you install fast api you just

00:21:04.880 --> 00:21:13.140
<v Michael Kennedy>here's how you run fast api dash new leveraging uv which then will you know silently install

00:21:13.660 --> 00:21:19.320
<v Michael Kennedy>and manage all right that's pretty neat that that helps you guys tell a simpler story

00:21:20.500 --> 00:21:25.220
<v Michael Kennedy>right yeah here's how you create the virtual environment to install our thing and so exactly

00:21:25.980 --> 00:21:30.759
<v Sebastian Ramirez>yeah the idea is to make it like as someone i was saying just super simple for people just to

00:21:30.820 --> 00:21:36.080
<v Sebastian Ramirez>start from scratch, like no idea how to create an app, how to start, how to create an environment.

00:21:36.200 --> 00:21:41.020
<v Sebastian Ramirez>It's just you run this command and you're off to go. After the races, I'm missing.

00:21:42.520 --> 00:21:49.780
<v Sebastian Ramirez>Anyway, that's what Colombians do. But then if you already have an app,

00:21:50.260 --> 00:21:55.620
<v Sebastian Ramirez>you have anything with FastAPI standard installed, then that also just works.

00:21:56.700 --> 00:22:03.100
<v Michael Kennedy>Yeah. Okay. And Savannah, you pointed out that it doesn't have to be a new project. If you want to

00:22:03.130 --> 00:22:09.240
<v Michael Kennedy>start from an existing one, that's totally fine. But what do I got to do if I'm starting from,

00:22:09.620 --> 00:22:14.060
<v Michael Kennedy>if I'm migrating an existing one? Like how easy or hard is this?

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:21.799
<v Savannah Ostrowski>Yeah. I mean, honestly, like I have some like legacy project demo apps I've built at other

00:22:21.820 --> 00:22:28.180
<v Savannah Ostrowski>companies I've worked with that have used FastAPI and I literally just ran like FastAPI login and

00:22:28.260 --> 00:22:34.600
<v Savannah Ostrowski>then FastAPI deploy and it just worked which felt really magical right like I think that's like I

00:22:34.600 --> 00:22:39.040
<v Savannah Ostrowski>don't know like having worked on cloud products for quite a while like I think one of the biggest

00:22:39.320 --> 00:22:44.160
<v Savannah Ostrowski>gaps is like the just I don't know like the disparity between like my local dev environment

00:22:44.380 --> 00:22:50.519
<v Savannah Ostrowski>and what is actually like lives up in the cloud somewhere and so being able to just run one command

00:22:50.540 --> 00:22:55.440
<v Savannah Ostrowski>and then having the project as it exists on my machine go and work somewhere without having to

00:22:55.440 --> 00:23:00.320
<v Savannah Ostrowski>think about like the infrastructure. And of course, like, you know, we want to be like amenable to

00:23:00.480 --> 00:23:05.940
<v Savannah Ostrowski>folks who do want a little bit, you know, like higher touch. But we also want to work for people

00:23:05.950 --> 00:23:11.760
<v Savannah Ostrowski>who are like learning FastAPI and Python, right? Like educators and people that are teaching Python.

00:23:11.970 --> 00:23:16.540
<v Savannah Ostrowski>I think this is like something that we've had some interest in as well from most folks. So,

00:23:18.260 --> 00:23:37.760
<v Michael Kennedy>Yeah, I was just listening to the Teaching Python podcast folks just the other day and thinking, you know, like this, when I look at this, I know this is not necessarily your focus, but certainly people who are trying to teach a class, be it college class or high school class or whatever.

00:23:39.100 --> 00:23:44.440
<v Michael Kennedy>And if you build anything on the web, the next question is, this is cool.

00:23:44.660 --> 00:23:45.780
<v Michael Kennedy>How do I share it with people?

00:23:46.100 --> 00:23:49.460
<v Michael Kennedy>And then like, oh, no, no, no, hold on.

00:23:49.920 --> 00:23:53.400
<v Savannah Ostrowski>Are you like in like coding boot camps, right?

00:23:53.540 --> 00:23:58.820
<v Savannah Ostrowski>Like if you're teaching someone how to write Python or how to write, build an API with

00:23:58.960 --> 00:24:04.020
<v Savannah Ostrowski>FastAPI, like actually setting up the environment for them to deploy is not part of it.

00:24:04.640 --> 00:24:04.720
<v Savannah Ostrowski>Right.

00:24:04.960 --> 00:24:06.900
<v Savannah Ostrowski>Like that's not actually part of the curriculum.

00:24:07.060 --> 00:24:11.240
<v Savannah Ostrowski>It's like this peripheral thing that ends up eating up a bunch of the educators time or

00:24:11.240 --> 00:24:15.000
<v Savannah Ostrowski>the students time trying to understand both like how to write code and then also understand

00:24:15.040 --> 00:24:15.620
<v Savannah Ostrowski>cloud stuff.

00:24:15.920 --> 00:24:18.700
<v Savannah Ostrowski>And that's like a lot to ask people when they're fresh out the gate.

00:24:19.500 --> 00:24:23.560
<v Michael Kennedy>Yeah. I mean, I feel the same way about like tutorials and stuff at conferences.

00:24:24.360 --> 00:24:27.540
<v Michael Kennedy>Yeah. Or, yeah. Or training sessions.

00:24:27.950 --> 00:24:31.000
<v Michael Kennedy>If you're doing like corporate training or like, they're all like, Oh, well,

00:24:31.180 --> 00:24:35.720
<v Michael Kennedy>let's get everybody's machine work. There goes an hour, whatever.

00:24:36.040 --> 00:24:39.040
<v Michael Kennedy>But yeah, if you can just say, look, I think when you're,

00:24:40.320 --> 00:24:41.900
<v Michael Kennedy>either when you're trying to learn something,

00:24:42.360 --> 00:24:48.900
<v Michael Kennedy>be it through school or on your own or through these like more structured ways like boot camps and

00:24:49.740 --> 00:24:56.360
<v Michael Kennedy>training and so on i think if it's not the main purpose i feel so often there's like we're going

00:24:56.360 --> 00:25:03.080
<v Michael Kennedy>to do 20 steps for four hours before you get any sort of reward of what you've done and if you can

00:25:03.140 --> 00:25:07.180
<v Michael Kennedy>go okay do you have it running okay now you run this command look now it's on the internet like

00:25:07.210 --> 00:25:11.699
<v Michael Kennedy>oh wait awesome i got an app on the internet everybody look at me you know what i mean and

00:25:11.820 --> 00:25:16.920
<v Michael Kennedy>I think shortening that cycle to where people can have that aha moment.

00:25:17.070 --> 00:25:19.820
<v Michael Kennedy>And then later they can dive into like, well, how is it really working?

00:25:20.160 --> 00:25:21.380
<v Michael Kennedy>And what do we really need to understand?

00:25:21.980 --> 00:25:28.900
<v Michael Kennedy>But that quick iteration cycle, especially in the early parts of learning new tech, it's really important.

00:25:30.060 --> 00:25:35.480
<v Sebastian Ramirez>But also, you know, like down the line as well, I think, like, I don't know, there are so many things that I have been wanting to build.

00:25:36.140 --> 00:25:41.540
<v Sebastian Ramirez>And I don't, but I didn't because it was just so complex to deploy stuff.

00:25:41.630 --> 00:25:44.000
<v Sebastian Ramirez>You know, like knowing, knowing how to do the whole thing,

00:25:44.220 --> 00:25:48.440
<v Sebastian Ramirez>how to set up the clusters, the machines, install the Linux systems,

00:25:49.100 --> 00:25:51.160
<v Sebastian Ramirez>deploy the cluster, whatever, like all the stuff,

00:25:51.680 --> 00:25:54.420
<v Sebastian Ramirez>deploy the things, handling load balancers and HTTPS.

00:25:54.420 --> 00:25:57.120
<v Sebastian Ramirez>And like, you know, like I know how to do that.

00:25:57.280 --> 00:26:01.800
<v Sebastian Ramirez>I built one of the most popular websites teaching how to use Docker Swarm,

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:04.940
<v Sebastian Ramirez>which was like the contender before Kubernetes won everything.

00:26:06.680 --> 00:26:09.460
<v Sebastian Ramirez>But still, it's just so complicated doing all those steps.

00:26:09.580 --> 00:26:12.660
<v Sebastian Ramirez>I'll just not do it.

00:26:15.100 --> 00:26:18.500
<v Sebastian Ramirez>Now I can just play around and do random stuff and just deploy,

00:26:18.660 --> 00:26:19.400
<v Sebastian Ramirez>and it just works.

00:26:20.620 --> 00:26:21.260
<v Sebastian Ramirez>I really like that.

00:26:21.940 --> 00:26:26.140
<v Savannah Ostrowski>I guess coming back to that taking one for the team point

00:26:26.300 --> 00:26:28.520
<v Savannah Ostrowski>earlier, I feel like building Python tooling

00:26:28.820 --> 00:26:30.560
<v Savannah Ostrowski>is kind of like taking one for the team sometimes,

00:26:31.420 --> 00:26:34.760
<v Savannah Ostrowski>because you have these folks that are brand new to Python.

00:26:35.440 --> 00:26:38.700
<v Savannah Ostrowski>Python is an extremely approachable language for people who are new to writing code.

00:26:38.780 --> 00:26:44.540
<v Savannah Ostrowski>But then, you know, we also want to make FastAPI cloud work for someone that's building like an enterprise grade application.

00:26:44.900 --> 00:26:45.040
<v Savannah Ostrowski>Right.

00:26:45.540 --> 00:26:57.220
<v Savannah Ostrowski>And so like pretty wide spectrum of folks with like a million different use cases and different types of applications they want to deploy with different constraints and like security stuff.

00:26:57.620 --> 00:27:01.240
<v Savannah Ostrowski>And like, so, yeah, I think, I don't know, maybe that's just like Python tooling.

00:27:02.240 --> 00:27:05.900
<v Savannah Ostrowski>It's a lot of work, I guess, to build something that works for the masses.

00:27:06.920 --> 00:27:10.260
<v Michael Kennedy>Yeah, well, it's certainly tough to make something that feels simple,

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:14.780
<v Michael Kennedy>but it's not overly simplistic, you know, that can actually solve the problems.

00:27:15.140 --> 00:27:17.860
<v Savannah Ostrowski>Has the right knobs for the right users too, right?

00:27:18.920 --> 00:27:22.900
<v Jonathan Ehwald>I would argue we're not only trying to do it simple and easy.

00:27:23.180 --> 00:27:27.620
<v Jonathan Ehwald>I feel like we're choosing a particular flavor of simple, which is...

00:27:28.220 --> 00:27:30.080
<v Jonathan Ehwald>We have this discussion a few times.

00:27:30.340 --> 00:27:36.320
<v Jonathan Ehwald>like if you make a cloud how do we make it feel pythonic like what does that mean in a cloud

00:27:36.540 --> 00:27:41.620
<v Jonathan Ehwald>setting like we talk about pythonic libraries by them a coding style in the community a lot

00:27:42.160 --> 00:27:46.700
<v Jonathan Ehwald>and now we kind of try to transfer that like that flavor that feeling to the cloud and make

00:27:47.100 --> 00:27:52.120
<v Jonathan Ehwald>everything around that feel just like we want our libraries to feel so you feel at home as a

00:27:52.220 --> 00:27:57.599
<v Jonathan Ehwald>pipeline developer and it just feels right so that's an extra step on top of making it simple

00:27:57.640 --> 00:28:00.760
<v Jonathan Ehwald>and we discuss that a lot. At least that's how I feel about it.

00:28:02.360 --> 00:28:04.280
<v Michael Kennedy>Yeah. I love it.

00:28:05.200 --> 00:28:07.540
<v Michael Kennedy>I think it's one of the... Sorry, go ahead.

00:28:07.780 --> 00:28:08.080
<v Michael Kennedy>No, go ahead.

00:28:08.580 --> 00:28:13.380
<v Sebastian Ramirez>I was going to say that I think it's one of the coolest things about this thing.

00:28:15.500 --> 00:28:22.600
<v Sebastian Ramirez>People are being able to hear a few of us. There are a bunch of others. But each one of us is so

00:28:22.580 --> 00:28:28.480
<v Sebastian Ramirez>passionate about the things that we are working on. So like, you know, like, each one of us is

00:28:28.580 --> 00:28:33.340
<v Sebastian Ramirez>trying to make the best out of the things that we are building. And then like, we are so passionate

00:28:33.500 --> 00:28:39.340
<v Sebastian Ramirez>about the thing that we care about, and we are building that I think that that ends up in an

00:28:39.400 --> 00:28:47.080
<v Sebastian Ramirez>amazing result. For example, the CLI, we wanted to have some specific, you know, like, behavior,

00:28:47.300 --> 00:28:53.020
<v Sebastian Ramirez>some look and feel and like we wanted to be able to have like the best kind of the clis so patrick

00:28:53.160 --> 00:28:58.280
<v Sebastian Ramirez>went ahead and built this way bunch of tooling that we needed to be able to have it and like

00:28:58.400 --> 00:29:04.280
<v Sebastian Ramirez>maybe open source and everything so we could have this great experience when working with clis uh

00:29:04.880 --> 00:29:10.700
<v Sebastian Ramirez>like uh jonathan recently recently was doing so much stuff about the handling the caches and

00:29:10.760 --> 00:29:16.640
<v Sebastian Ramirez>handling security making sure that everything was super secure super fast super snappy uh you know

00:29:16.500 --> 00:29:22.920
<v Sebastian Ramirez>like a Alejandra is super careful about all the UI. Martin is super careful about all the infra.

00:29:23.280 --> 00:29:28.880
<v Sebastian Ramirez>You know, it's like this, this, this passionate nest, which is a word I just made up.

00:29:31.700 --> 00:29:36.600
<v Sebastian Ramirez>This, Alejandra goes and says like, this thing doesn't have the proper margins, we need to

00:29:36.760 --> 00:29:41.100
<v Sebastian Ramirez>increase this a little bit. I didn't, I don't like it. She just goes and fix it. The same with Martin.

00:29:41.140 --> 00:29:44.880
<v Sebastian Ramirez>He says like, we need to have like this, this other thing in infrastructure. And it's like,

00:29:45.320 --> 00:29:51.640
<v Sebastian Ramirez>just comes and tells me hey we are doing this like yes sir you know it's like this with the

00:29:51.740 --> 00:29:56.800
<v Sebastian Ramirez>work of the team like uh yuri for example that is mainly focused on the open sources constantly

00:29:57.140 --> 00:30:03.080
<v Sebastian Ramirez>looking at all the discussions prs conversations making sure that everything that we do uh that

00:30:03.180 --> 00:30:09.039
<v Sebastian Ramirez>that's also why you know like there have been like recently way more releases of fast api and friends

00:30:09.100 --> 00:30:15.700
<v Sebastian Ramirez>of the open source projects and very fast book fixes very fast responses to handle everything

00:30:15.880 --> 00:30:20.620
<v Sebastian Ramirez>for the community and now we actually like have people that is paying attention constantly to

00:30:20.680 --> 00:30:25.040
<v Sebastian Ramirez>what is happening what what is what are the things that we have to do and that really care about

00:30:25.700 --> 00:30:31.760
<v Sebastian Ramirez>a that part as well so i think this extreme care about what what we are you know like savannah is

00:30:31.780 --> 00:30:42.320
<v Sebastian Ramirez>making python and hello i don't know i think this detail that each one of us cares so so much about

00:30:42.540 --> 00:30:47.240
<v Sebastian Ramirez>each one of the things that we build hey that that helps a lot making sure that the product is

00:30:47.400 --> 00:30:54.620
<v Sebastian Ramirez>actually amazing it's as good as it can be and we can all feel at home when doing it i don't know

00:30:54.920 --> 00:31:01.740
<v Sebastian Ramirez>i get i get so excited because i really enjoy the end result of the product and being able to use

00:31:01.760 --> 00:31:04.920
<v Sebastian Ramirez>and how it works in the end, how it needs to work with it,

00:31:05.280 --> 00:31:06.200
<v Sebastian Ramirez>it's super simple.

00:31:07.940 --> 00:31:08.600
<v Michael Kennedy>Yeah, that's awesome.

00:31:08.760 --> 00:31:09.980
<v Michael Kennedy>Here, let me adjust your mic real quick.

00:31:10.380 --> 00:31:13.800
<v Michael Kennedy>I think it was like ducking, ducking out a little bit.

00:31:13.800 --> 00:31:17.220
<v Jonathan Ehwald>We just went through a lot of content and a lot of sweating

00:31:17.560 --> 00:31:21.660
<v Jonathan Ehwald>because your microphone went through like six different stages.

00:31:24.100 --> 00:31:24.940
<v Michael Kennedy>Yeah, that's, I think,

00:31:27.440 --> 00:31:36.300
<v Michael Kennedy>So I think that really leads to something I wanted to talk about is just what impact has this had on FastAPI?

00:31:36.300 --> 00:31:53.820
<v Michael Kennedy>And before you jump in and answer that question, everyone, there's, especially I think with Astral, because they've had so much success, there's been an undercurrent of concern of like, oh my gosh, commercialism is getting into our open source.

00:31:54.240 --> 00:31:57.740
<v Michael Kennedy>What if it pollutes it and causes these negative aspects?

00:31:59.299 --> 00:32:03.640
<v Michael Kennedy>But just hearing all of the energy around FastAPI

00:32:03.670 --> 00:32:07.220
<v Michael Kennedy>with so many people because of FastAPI Cloud,

00:32:07.550 --> 00:32:09.120
<v Michael Kennedy>I think that's super neat.

00:32:09.400 --> 00:32:10.720
<v Michael Kennedy>So I wanted to throw out to you all,

00:32:12.720 --> 00:32:17.180
<v Michael Kennedy>how is this building FastAPI Cloud and the existence of FastAPI

00:32:17.380 --> 00:32:21.140
<v Michael Kennedy>Cloud been giving back to FastAPI, I guess?

00:32:28.860 --> 00:32:31.380
<v Sebastian Ramirez>I'm always the one that's speaking the most.

00:32:33.040 --> 00:32:34.680
<v Savannah Ostrowski>I mean, it might be your project.

00:32:35.060 --> 00:32:36.440
<v Savannah Ostrowski>You might have started the project.

00:32:37.679 --> 00:32:38.780
<v Michael Kennedy>Yeah, maybe so.

00:32:39.660 --> 00:32:47.100
<v Sebastian Ramirez>No, but you know, like last year, I had a few keynotes in some PyCons in different places.

00:32:47.320 --> 00:32:57.940
<v Sebastian Ramirez>And like one of the key points that I wanted to bring was this idea that I'm trying to show that in many cases, people worry about the boss factor.

00:32:58.340 --> 00:33:00.100
<v Sebastian Ramirez>Yes, yes, I've heard this. Yes.

00:33:01.060 --> 00:33:07.000
<v Sebastian Ramirez>Yeah, you know, like the boss factor is the idea that, oh, what happens if like there's one person doing this work?

00:33:07.060 --> 00:33:09.960
<v Sebastian Ramirez>What happens if a boss runs over this person?

00:33:10.480 --> 00:33:14.200
<v Sebastian Ramirez>And there's so much worry about this boss factor.

00:33:14.860 --> 00:33:18.620
<v Michael Kennedy>It's sort of a morbid analogy, but I understand, right?

00:33:18.700 --> 00:33:24.000
<v Michael Kennedy>It's like, what will happen to the open source project if the maintainer vanishes for some reason, right?

00:33:24.240 --> 00:33:24.560
<v Sebastian Ramirez>Exactly.

00:33:25.380 --> 00:33:28.400
<v Sebastian Ramirez>But, you know, like it also applies to products and to many other different things.

00:33:29.320 --> 00:33:36.480
<v Sebastian Ramirez>But what I think is that is a disproportionate amount of attention to this detail of the boss factor.

00:33:37.320 --> 00:33:44.760
<v Sebastian Ramirez>And I think every time people talk about the boss factor, you know, like one of my points in what I was trying to say

00:33:44.780 --> 00:33:51.320
<v Sebastian Ramirez>these talks was I would like people to think about the bus ticket factor who is paying for those

00:33:51.540 --> 00:33:57.340
<v Sebastian Ramirez>tickets it doesn't matter how big is the team you know like you have seen google amazon meta all the

00:33:57.400 --> 00:34:03.420
<v Sebastian Ramirez>big ones they don't have a small boost factor they have a lot of people in their payroll and still

00:34:03.900 --> 00:34:11.899
<v Sebastian Ramirez>they they finish products they just cancel them open source or private or whatever it's not

00:34:11.919 --> 00:34:18.340
<v Sebastian Ramirez>that the main factor defining the success of a project being it commercial or open source of

00:34:18.419 --> 00:34:26.060
<v Sebastian Ramirez>any type is not really how many people are behind it it's more of what is the value that whoever

00:34:26.060 --> 00:34:31.399
<v Sebastian Ramirez>is putting the effort to keep it alive is getting from putting all that effort it could be just

00:34:31.639 --> 00:34:36.139
<v Sebastian Ramirez>satisfaction you know it could be like open source like i feel i feel so good that i'm contributing

00:34:36.159 --> 00:34:41.600
<v Sebastian Ramirez>into society and that is valid. It doesn't pay the rent but it is still valid. It might

00:34:41.690 --> 00:34:46.260
<v Sebastian Ramirez>last for a while. But then also like when you see there are so many Python projects,

00:34:46.340 --> 00:34:52.540
<v Sebastian Ramirez>so many open source projects that can do well or can do bad and it doesn't really depend

00:34:52.700 --> 00:34:57.740
<v Sebastian Ramirez>on how many people they have. And when you are using a project, when you are using an

00:34:57.820 --> 00:35:03.240
<v Sebastian Ramirez>open source project or when you are using a product of any type, I will encourage you

00:35:03.260 --> 00:35:08.780
<v Sebastian Ramirez>to think about what is the bus ticket factor of this project what are the

00:35:08.900 --> 00:35:14.540
<v Sebastian Ramirez>things that whoever is building this is receiving in exchange for giving it away

00:35:15.460 --> 00:35:20.440
<v Sebastian Ramirez>so like you know like what are they expecting to sell you at some point or

00:35:20.560 --> 00:35:26.380
<v Sebastian Ramirez>what are they receiving in exchange you know for example Bunn the JavaScript

00:35:26.560 --> 00:35:29.820
<v Sebastian Ramirez>Brompton library like it was like we don't know what they are going to sell

00:35:29.840 --> 00:35:36.840
<v Sebastian Ramirez>but now you know cloud and entropic really want to have like this thing keep working because they

00:35:36.860 --> 00:35:41.520
<v Sebastian Ramirez>are using it internally so you can say like okay i'm gonna use it i'm gonna use it for free i know

00:35:41.640 --> 00:35:47.360
<v Sebastian Ramirez>that what they receive for me using is just like that they just really want it so i can just like

00:35:47.480 --> 00:35:52.060
<v Sebastian Ramirez>whenever you are using bond you are getting now you are getting free services from entropic that's

00:35:52.140 --> 00:35:58.460
<v Sebastian Ramirez>it but you know like every time you are using a project you can think about why are people receiving

00:35:58.480 --> 00:36:03.740
<v Sebastian Ramirez>in this change for giving this away for me. I think this is... sorry, go ahead, Sonia.

00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:05.060
<v Savannah Ostrowski>No, no, no, you finish it.

00:36:06.460 --> 00:36:11.560
<v Sebastian Ramirez>No, no, that I think I... this is like the thing that I would like people to think about, you know,

00:36:11.640 --> 00:36:17.560
<v Sebastian Ramirez>like, also like how can they give back? Maybe they can also actually contribute to that community or

00:36:17.660 --> 00:36:22.400
<v Sebastian Ramirez>to the project. There are many ways and in many cases, the thing that is needed the most is just

00:36:22.400 --> 00:36:24.940
<v Sebastian Ramirez>like help and work just answering questions and issues.

00:36:26.020 --> 00:36:26.400
<v Sebastian Ramirez>So yeah.

00:36:27.420 --> 00:36:30.000
<v Savannah Ostrowski>Yeah, I was just going to say that, like kind of related to what you're saying,

00:36:30.080 --> 00:36:34.520
<v Savannah Ostrowski>I think one of the angles that I really appreciate about the way we think about

00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:39.380
<v Savannah Ostrowski>FastAPI and FastAPI Cloud is like we're like a lot of our team was involved in open

00:36:39.520 --> 00:36:44.960
<v Savannah Ostrowski>source before coming to work at FastAPI Cloud on various projects around the Python ecosystem

00:36:45.160 --> 00:36:45.680
<v Savannah Ostrowski>outside of Python.

00:36:46.440 --> 00:36:51.640
<v Savannah Ostrowski>And I think like all of us have a deep appreciation and understanding of the value

00:36:51.660 --> 00:36:58.460
<v Savannah Ostrowski>of open source and really, really try and build in a way that is like, I mean, Sebastian,

00:36:58.560 --> 00:37:03.100
<v Savannah Ostrowski>you've talked about this a lot, but like solving a real problem for folks, right? And so like

00:37:03.260 --> 00:37:07.700
<v Savannah Ostrowski>FastAPI cloud is sort of this like extension of this open source ecosystem people would

00:37:07.700 --> 00:37:13.200
<v Savannah Ostrowski>be using. We, you know, FastAPI cloud may be an option, maybe someone picks some other

00:37:13.320 --> 00:37:21.620
<v Savannah Ostrowski>cloud for some reason. I don't think like, I think we're all very mindful of that. But

00:37:21.940 --> 00:37:26.560
<v Savannah Ostrowski>all work at FastAPI Cloud, like I know that I personally have time, more time for my open source

00:37:26.760 --> 00:37:32.700
<v Savannah Ostrowski>work and my employer understands the value of my open source work, which is net positive for the

00:37:32.740 --> 00:37:38.700
<v Savannah Ostrowski>open source community. Like I get to work on CPython sometimes and I have, you know, the bandwidth to

00:37:38.720 --> 00:37:44.480
<v Savannah Ostrowski>go and do my steering council work or upcoming release management work. So I think like, I

00:37:44.660 --> 00:37:50.360
<v Savannah Ostrowski>understand like this sort of like, I don't know, like tempering, like open source commercial bad,

00:37:50.860 --> 00:37:54.440
<v Savannah Ostrowski>all bad. It's not all bad. It's actually like really good in a lot of cases for

00:37:55.040 --> 00:37:59.900
<v Michael Kennedy>look at uv for an example of the holdup, right? Yeah. Astral. Yeah, yeah, totally. Yeah. Yeah.

00:38:00.620 --> 00:38:06.220
<v Savannah Ostrowski>I think there are some really good examples of this. So I think like, that's another angle that

00:38:06.220 --> 00:38:10.680
<v Savannah Ostrowski>I mean, I really, I get a lot of energy out of our team because we all, I don't have to,

00:38:10.960 --> 00:38:15.660
<v Savannah Ostrowski>I don't have to fight the open source battle at FastAPI and Cloud. I think that's really cool.

00:38:17.160 --> 00:38:18.660
<v Michael Kennedy>I do think that's super cool as well.

00:38:18.660 --> 00:38:23.100
<v Michael Kennedy>Let me put out two examples for you here that I think everyone will be aware of.

00:38:24.580 --> 00:38:27.920
<v Michael Kennedy>As sort of to add to what Sebastian was saying is,

00:38:28.960 --> 00:38:33.600
<v Michael Kennedy>look how much Apple freaked out when Steve Jobs died and how many people work at Apple.

00:38:34.280 --> 00:38:34.360
<v Michael Kennedy>Right.

00:38:34.940 --> 00:38:37.360
<v Michael Kennedy>Like that was still like, oh, my gosh.

00:38:37.960 --> 00:38:40.820
<v Michael Kennedy>But, you know, I think there's they're hanging in there.

00:38:40.940 --> 00:38:42.080
<v Michael Kennedy>They're going to be probably making it.

00:38:44.540 --> 00:38:44.820
<v Michael Kennedy>And then.

00:38:44.940 --> 00:38:46.260
<v Sebastian Ramirez>They are not enough people.

00:38:47.200 --> 00:38:48.800
<v Michael Kennedy>I tell you what, they got some of my money.

00:38:49.340 --> 00:38:49.800
<v Michael Kennedy>That's for sure.

00:38:51.920 --> 00:38:54.460
<v Michael Kennedy>But also, you know, look at Flask, right?

00:38:54.660 --> 00:38:56.740
<v Michael Kennedy>Armin Roeneker worked on it for a long time,

00:38:57.580 --> 00:38:59.360
<v Michael Kennedy>drifted away, which is totally fine.

00:39:00.040 --> 00:39:03.860
<v Michael Kennedy>And David Lord and Pallets picked it up and kept running, right?

00:39:04.040 --> 00:39:09.140
<v Michael Kennedy>Like, it's still one of the most popular frameworks out there, right?

00:39:09.340 --> 00:39:10.880
<v Michael Kennedy>So it's...

00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:21.620
<v Michael Kennedy>I think the bus factor is over, overblown a bit, but also looking at the team of folks here, I think it's, it's even more obvious that there's a bunch of people on the inside.

00:39:22.280 --> 00:39:37.060
<v Sebastian Ramirez>But, but you know, like, for example, for example, Flask, you know, like I learned so many things from Flask and like, the thing is, I feel like sometimes, sometimes people go and complain about the tool and say like, oh, this is not working for this or for that.

00:39:37.280 --> 00:39:42.260
<v Sebastian Ramirez>and in many cases is in this insensitive way towards the people that are working on that.

00:39:42.900 --> 00:39:47.320
<v Sebastian Ramirez>And it's like, you know, like in the end, realize that there's actually people behind the scenes doing the work.

00:39:47.600 --> 00:39:51.480
<v Sebastian Ramirez>And like, in many cases, it's just like one or two people doing a lot of work.

00:39:51.480 --> 00:39:52.860
<v Sebastian Ramirez>In many cases, it's just for free.

00:39:53.200 --> 00:39:57.720
<v Sebastian Ramirez>And, you know, like I think it's worth calling that out.

00:39:57.740 --> 00:40:01.600
<v Sebastian Ramirez>Like all the work that David Lord does for Flask, it's just like so much work.

00:40:01.860 --> 00:40:05.780
<v Sebastian Ramirez>And yeah, I think deserves a lot of respect.

00:40:06.820 --> 00:40:06.980
<v Sebastian Ramirez>Yeah.

00:40:07.060 --> 00:40:09.400
<v Michael Kennedy>Yeah, for sure. I totally agree.

00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:19.600
<v Sebastian Ramirez>Sorry, the other thing that I forgot to mention is that there were so many ideas of potential products that I could build over the years,

00:40:19.680 --> 00:40:27.800
<v Sebastian Ramirez>and I never did, and I never started a company, because I didn't have clarity of what will be a good thing to actually sell and will have a good alignment.

00:40:28.300 --> 00:40:33.620
<v Sebastian Ramirez>the cloud product has such a good alignment with the open source side because

00:40:34.400 --> 00:40:34.960
<v Sebastian Ramirez>the

00:40:36.020 --> 00:40:37.820
<v Sebastian Ramirez>you know like as

00:40:38.460 --> 00:40:42.120
<v Sebastian Ramirez>More successful FastAPI is the more successful

00:40:42.700 --> 00:40:47.860
<v Sebastian Ramirez>FastAPI cloud has a potential to be the more people using Python's

00:40:48.500 --> 00:40:54.060
<v Sebastian Ramirez>Effectively the more people might end up checking out FastAPI and the more people might end up checking out the product

00:40:54.360 --> 00:40:59.300
<v Sebastian Ramirez>So if FastAPI does well, if the open source does well, if Python does well, that's better for the company.

00:40:59.390 --> 00:41:05.420
<v Sebastian Ramirez>So, you know, like, it doesn't really depend on my personal principles and values or something like that.

00:41:05.760 --> 00:41:10.100
<v Sebastian Ramirez>It's aligned with, it's financially aligned with the company.

00:41:10.370 --> 00:41:16.740
<v Sebastian Ramirez>So, you know, like, it's just going to be beneficial in the end because it doesn't depend on good intentions.

00:41:17.640 --> 00:41:19.020
<v Sebastian Ramirez>And FastAPI is open source.

00:41:19.190 --> 00:41:21.120
<v Sebastian Ramirez>It has, like, 7,000 forks or something.

00:41:21.200 --> 00:41:23.380
<v Sebastian Ramirez>So if I was running, so right.

00:41:24.240 --> 00:41:26.300
<v Sebastian Ramirez>There are 7,000 points is not going away.

00:41:27.360 --> 00:41:27.760
<v Sebastian Ramirez>Yeah.

00:41:27.760 --> 00:41:27.820
<v Sebastian Ramirez>Yeah.

00:41:28.860 --> 00:41:29.260
<v Michael Kennedy>Yeah.

00:41:29.560 --> 00:41:31.640
<v Michael Kennedy>I, I definitely agree with you on that.

00:41:31.680 --> 00:41:36.160
<v Michael Kennedy>I think, I feel like I should maybe give a little bit of a,

00:41:36.820 --> 00:41:41.060
<v Michael Kennedy>I tell a little bit of the story of what's going on with,  where did I put it?

00:41:42.560 --> 00:41:46.020
<v Michael Kennedy>I don't think I paste it over here is what's going on with tail end right now.

00:41:46.500 --> 00:41:50.380
<v Michael Kennedy>And I think tail end is having a tough time to one CSS.

00:41:51.839 --> 00:42:03.540
<v Michael Kennedy>traffic to tailwind is up six times year over year on npm downloads but the revenue of tailwind

00:42:04.010 --> 00:42:11.960
<v Michael Kennedy>is down five times you know i mean these are completely out of whack things because instead

00:42:11.960 --> 00:42:16.700
<v Michael Kennedy>of people going to docs to learn about it it's just like well when you go to the docs you learn

00:42:16.640 --> 00:42:20.480
<v Michael Kennedy>they also have premium offerings right and I think you guys are different

00:42:20.780 --> 00:42:26.060
<v Michael Kennedy>because it's not just oh here's a little bit nicer of a thing right I feel like

00:42:26.060 --> 00:42:29.160
<v Michael Kennedy>it would be a little bit as if you were selling cookie cutter templates for

00:42:29.300 --> 00:42:34.960
<v Michael Kennedy>FastAPI apps you know it's like well the AI can make the shape of the thing

00:42:35.060 --> 00:42:38.440
<v Michael Kennedy>that comes out of the cookie cutter to be honest you know I mean but but you're

00:42:38.580 --> 00:42:45.300
<v Michael Kennedy>offering something that has ongoing value that it costs more and is more

00:42:45.320 --> 00:42:57.640
<v Michael Kennedy>complex in other places. And so I think maybe just thinking about the how this just keeps the team

00:42:57.900 --> 00:43:02.740
<v Michael Kennedy>going for FastAPI is really awesome. And I think it's got a nice flywheel effect there.

00:43:03.920 --> 00:43:10.100
<v Michael Kennedy>I'll link to this, I guess, audio track. I don't know what I call it. I think blog post that has

00:43:10.100 --> 00:43:15.180
<v Michael Kennedy>one sentence, but a 30 minute audio you can check out from the guy, Adam, who's one of

00:43:15.180 --> 00:43:17.700
<v Michael Kennedy>the founders of Tailwind talking about going into this.

00:43:18.540 --> 00:43:19.400
<v Michael Kennedy>It's kind of rough.

00:43:20.960 --> 00:43:24.520
<v Michael Kennedy>I think I don't necessarily want to go into a deep AI, what it means for the industry.

00:43:24.660 --> 00:43:26.660
<v Michael Kennedy>Like, let's stay focused on what you guys are doing.

00:43:26.660 --> 00:43:30.540
<v Michael Kennedy>But I think it's going to be, it's going to be, I think it's going to be its own series.

00:43:30.700 --> 00:43:37.060
<v Michael Kennedy>I mean, Stack Overflow had as many questions asked this month as they did in the first

00:43:37.260 --> 00:43:38.880
<v Michael Kennedy>month of their existence.

00:43:39.820 --> 00:43:39.940
<v Michael Kennedy>Right.

00:43:40.040 --> 00:43:44.620
<v Michael Kennedy>three or four thousand, whereas at their peak, they were 200,000 questions a month.

00:43:45.080 --> 00:43:50.620
<v Michael Kennedy>There's like real turmoil that's coming from some of these things, which is tricky.

00:43:51.460 --> 00:43:57.400
<v Michael Kennedy>But yeah, I'm really excited to see you all doing this because I'm a big fan of FastAPI.

00:43:57.790 --> 00:44:04.800
<v Michael Kennedy>And I think this is just sustaining and more for FastAPI, right?

00:44:04.830 --> 00:44:05.480
<v Michael Kennedy>Like, what do you all think?

00:44:07.440 --> 00:44:08.980
<v Sebastian Ramirez>I'm thinking about it.

00:44:09.680 --> 00:44:10.440
<v Sebastian Ramirez>That's what we hope.

00:44:14.860 --> 00:44:17.420
<v Jonathan Ehwald>I thought about Taiwan for a second, right?

00:44:17.580 --> 00:44:19.780
<v Jonathan Ehwald>It's not like we're immune to what happened to them.

00:44:19.920 --> 00:44:22.000
<v Jonathan Ehwald>Like, we also have a lot of documentation online.

00:44:22.400 --> 00:44:23.560
<v Jonathan Ehwald>AI could train on that.

00:44:23.760 --> 00:44:26.800
<v Jonathan Ehwald>And if it's good enough, it could maintain your infrastructure and stuff.

00:44:26.940 --> 00:44:28.480
<v Jonathan Ehwald>It's just too hard at the moment.

00:44:28.600 --> 00:44:33.660
<v Jonathan Ehwald>And there's an additional thing we're kind of selling, which is like, I guess, responsibility.

00:44:33.820 --> 00:44:42.020
<v Jonathan Ehwald>like and you're shifting the risk from like letting your ai or your infantry the team um maintain your

00:44:42.240 --> 00:44:48.540
<v Jonathan Ehwald>infrastructure to us so we're staying up at night and worry about it that's that that has a lot of

00:44:48.620 --> 00:44:54.920
<v Michael Kennedy>value as well and that's probably not going to get removed yeah and i also think here here here's a

00:44:54.940 --> 00:45:04.240
<v Michael Kennedy>very common cloud code, cursor, whatever conversation. Hey, build me something with Python and

00:45:04.300 --> 00:45:09.700
<v Michael Kennedy>needs an API. Okay, we built it with FastAPI. How do I host it? Right? That doesn't just,

00:45:10.220 --> 00:45:15.840
<v Michael Kennedy>it will build a cloud for you, right? It's going to recommend something out there. And a real

00:45:16.040 --> 00:45:22.140
<v Michael Kennedy>natural way to how do I host FastAPI is FastAPI cloud, right? Like, if it suggests, oh,

00:45:22.220 --> 00:45:26.140
<v Michael Kennedy>you're just going to like spread it across lamb but lambda by breaking like whoa no I want something

00:45:26.280 --> 00:45:30.360
<v Michael Kennedy>simple okay give me FastAPI cloud right I think that that's a really good thing and then on the

00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:40.200
<v Michael Kennedy>the enterprise side you know enterprise folks are notoriously not good at supporting open source and

00:45:40.240 --> 00:45:47.260
<v Michael Kennedy>that they're not like paying for it I know some companies are big supporters of the PSF and Python

00:45:47.280 --> 00:45:52.620
<v Michael Kennedy>and open source but in general it's like yeah we have this project with 5 000 people working on it's

00:45:52.660 --> 00:45:59.840
<v Michael Kennedy>all python and how are we sponsoring this nope just we're just enjoying the money right and we're

00:45:59.840 --> 00:46:05.960
<v Michael Kennedy>a bank so we got the money we got all the money um so they they're just not good at paying for like

00:46:05.960 --> 00:46:11.820
<v Michael Kennedy>a really great framework that they use a lot but they got plenty of hosting plenty of internal apps

00:46:11.860 --> 00:46:16.460
<v Michael Kennedy>that they just need to make run and stuff so i think both on like the low end and the high end

00:46:17.200 --> 00:46:24.480
<v Michael Kennedy>there's a lot of synergy between these things that is not just, you know, slightly advanced, not to

00:46:26.420 --> 00:46:31.860
<v Michael Kennedy>diminish it, but slightly advanced UI widgets that you could ask your AI to build or,

00:46:32.180 --> 00:46:34.740
<v Michael Kennedy>or something or like cookie cutter templates for project starters.

00:46:36.060 --> 00:46:43.940
<v Sebastian Ramirez>Yeah. Yeah, yeah. That's true. Like, I think we are in a somewhat fortunate position of like,

00:46:43.960 --> 00:46:49.260
<v Sebastian Ramirez>you know like fast api has grown so much in like you know like when you check the statistics about

00:46:49.660 --> 00:46:55.840
<v Sebastian Ramirez>downloads or github stars or entries in developer surveys like it's at the top in like in each

00:46:55.960 --> 00:47:00.760
<v Sebastian Ramirez>category it's like you know like the backend framework with the most github stars across

00:47:00.920 --> 00:47:07.140
<v Sebastian Ramirez>languages even like you know like java go ruby js like whatever it's like the top one at least

00:47:07.200 --> 00:47:14.060
<v Sebastian Ramirez>in github stars so like you know like fast api at least is like people are liking it fortunately

00:47:14.500 --> 00:47:19.480
<v Sebastian Ramirez>and there's probably gonna be people deploying things to fast api cloud so that's probably gonna

00:47:19.620 --> 00:47:27.020
<v Sebastian Ramirez>be like we are probably gonna be fine i think did you know like the i guess it will be like a good

00:47:27.060 --> 00:47:32.560
<v Sebastian Ramirez>point to to ask people to go and check where the open source projects that they are using and check

00:47:32.440 --> 00:47:37.300
<v Sebastian Ramirez>what is the boss ticket factor for those open source projects? You know, like if you are using

00:47:37.740 --> 00:47:43.100
<v Sebastian Ramirez>Tailwind CSS, it would have been very cool if at some point you check if the premium things were

00:47:43.180 --> 00:47:46.640
<v Sebastian Ramirez>useful for you and for your company or your project or something like that, you know?

00:47:49.039 --> 00:47:52.100
<v Sebastian Ramirez>Because what is the thing that keeps that project going?

00:47:53.980 --> 00:48:02.400
<v Michael Kennedy>Right, exactly. And I really personally admire if a project or something

00:48:02.620 --> 00:48:06.200
<v Michael Kennedy>offers like more value, not just, hey, buy me a coffee,

00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:09.920
<v Michael Kennedy>but here's a thing that you get way more of, you know,

00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:11.980
<v Michael Kennedy>and in that regard, I think Tailwind was doing that, right?

00:48:11.980 --> 00:48:14.480
<v Michael Kennedy>They were offering this suite of pre-built things,

00:48:14.810 --> 00:48:16.160
<v Michael Kennedy>and I think that that's great.

00:48:17.320 --> 00:48:20.880
<v Michael Kennedy>But, yeah, I do think you've got more of a,

00:48:22.380 --> 00:48:24.400
<v Michael Kennedy>these crazy AI things are going to maybe recommend

00:48:24.779 --> 00:48:27.280
<v Michael Kennedy>FastAPI Cloud more than they're just going to undercut it.

00:48:27.290 --> 00:48:28.140
<v Michael Kennedy>So I think that's really great.

00:48:28.460 --> 00:48:32.380
<v Michael Kennedy>And by the way, I was just looking for the GitHub Stars graph

00:48:32.400 --> 00:48:36.540
<v Michael Kennedy>Like there's a whole, I can't remember what the domain of that site is, but, and I

00:48:36.680 --> 00:48:38.500
<v Michael Kennedy>ran across by the, I just want to give a quick shout out.

00:48:38.650 --> 00:48:43.380
<v Michael Kennedy>Like your cult repo documentary on FastAPI was awesome.

00:48:44.500 --> 00:48:44.860
<v Sebastian Ramirez>Right.

00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:45.680
<v Sebastian Ramirez>That was so fun.

00:48:46.400 --> 00:48:47.140
<v Michael Kennedy>I didn't see that coming.

00:48:47.920 --> 00:48:48.060
<v Michael Kennedy>Yeah.

00:48:48.270 --> 00:48:52.460
<v Michael Kennedy>It came right on the heels of the Python official documentary, the one hour one.

00:48:52.470 --> 00:48:55.600
<v Michael Kennedy>This is the same group and it, the production quality was really nice.

00:48:55.760 --> 00:48:57.520
<v Michael Kennedy>So like, oh, yeah, it was super fun.

00:48:58.040 --> 00:49:01.880
<v Sebastian Ramirez>When they released the trailer for the Python documentary,

00:49:02.160 --> 00:49:04.220
<v Sebastian Ramirez>before releasing the documentary, when they released the trailer,

00:49:04.460 --> 00:49:08.360
<v Sebastian Ramirez>they contacted me and said, "Hey, we're doing these mini documentaries

00:49:08.780 --> 00:49:10.220
<v Sebastian Ramirez>about different frameworks, different tools,

00:49:10.300 --> 00:49:11.920
<v Sebastian Ramirez>and we want to include FastAPI."

00:49:11.920 --> 00:49:13.120
<v Sebastian Ramirez>They were like, "Oh, nice."

00:49:14.320 --> 00:49:17.260
<v Sebastian Ramirez>I was just trying to stay silent, but super excited.

00:49:17.840 --> 00:49:19.840
<v Michael Kennedy>I'm sure. That's so cool.

00:49:20.060 --> 00:49:21.520
<v Michael Kennedy>Yeah, I watched it as soon as it came out.

00:49:22.320 --> 00:49:23.100
<v Michael Kennedy>I'll link to that.

00:49:23.220 --> 00:49:25.280
<v Michael Kennedy>People should definitely-- it's only like 10 minutes or something,

00:49:25.480 --> 00:49:30.540
<v Michael Kennedy>but it's worth it. We're checking out. So it's not a huge investment time. People can watch it,

00:49:30.540 --> 00:49:35.520
<v Michael Kennedy>I suppose. It's not tick tock. I mean, it's not like, Oh, I saw the documentary.

00:49:40.080 --> 00:49:42.940
<v Michael Kennedy>It doesn't take you on huge about it. Yeah, people.

00:49:44.540 --> 00:49:49.840
<v Michael Kennedy>It is such a weird time. You guys, the I don't understand what's happened to the

00:49:50.200 --> 00:49:55.440
<v Michael Kennedy>attention span of society. I'm really honestly a little concerned. I used when I create my

00:49:55.480 --> 00:49:59.260
<v Michael Kennedy>is people would say, you know, like a four hour course, and there'd be like a 10, 15 minute sort

00:49:59.260 --> 00:50:02.300
<v Michael Kennedy>of, hey, here's how you set up your computer. And here's all the introduction. And people, oh,

00:50:02.440 --> 00:50:05.840
<v Michael Kennedy>that's so awesome. I loved how you kind of set the stage. I'm really motivated to take the course.

00:50:06.420 --> 00:50:10.360
<v Michael Kennedy>Nowadays, I just get messages like, why are you still talking? This is five minutes long. Do you

00:50:10.560 --> 00:50:17.080
<v Michael Kennedy>understand? I'm like, this is your job. You can't spend five minutes. Oh my gosh. Anyway, that's

00:50:17.180 --> 00:50:21.700
<v Michael Kennedy>that's sort of the origin of my comment there. It's all right. So we're kind of getting somewhat

00:50:21.720 --> 00:50:30.420
<v Michael Kennedy>short on time so i think i think i want to talk about a couple of things let's let's talk a little

00:50:30.540 --> 00:50:36.020
<v Michael Kennedy>bit about internals like what i don't know who wants to take this one but let's talk about just

00:50:36.240 --> 00:50:41.800
<v Michael Kennedy>how when i say fast api deploy then what

00:50:46.040 --> 00:50:52.000
<v Michael Kennedy>It's just a UB pip install and it just goes and it's magic and it's easy, right?

00:50:52.550 --> 00:50:55.200
<v Sebastian Ramirez>We haven't had anything before, Jonathan, can we save or no?

00:50:55.480 --> 00:50:58.960
<v Savannah Ostrowski>Yeah, I was going to say, I was going to say, Kronathan, you should take this one.

00:51:00.760 --> 00:51:02.820
<v Jonathan Ehwald>Oh my God, it's so funny, this happened.

00:51:03.260 --> 00:51:06.180
<v Jonathan Ehwald>Because I told my friends, I'm so concerned about being at the podcast

00:51:06.490 --> 00:51:10.060
<v Jonathan Ehwald>because everyone here is a visionary and then I'm the backend guy.

00:51:10.780 --> 00:51:14.020
<v Jonathan Ehwald>And I think the things I could contribute to this conversation,

00:51:14.090 --> 00:51:15.220
<v Jonathan Ehwald>I should probably keep to myself.

00:51:16.480 --> 00:51:24.600
<v Jonathan Ehwald>but it's just leaking internals right um there are some things that are like not really a secret

00:51:25.000 --> 00:51:33.300
<v Jonathan Ehwald>like as Sebastian said earlier like kubernetes one and in the infrastructure and deployment field

00:51:33.540 --> 00:51:40.000
<v Jonathan Ehwald>to some extent so that's somewhere in there right uh but it's it's all the way deep down so no one

00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:45.400
<v Jonathan Ehwald>has to worry about it but it's still a foundation which is a good foundation um I think one thing

00:51:45.420 --> 00:51:50.860
<v Jonathan Ehwald>that's you you might have guessed it but fast api cloud is built on fast api which kind of makes

00:51:50.980 --> 00:51:57.760
<v Jonathan Ehwald>sense right um and that also has an effect on like recent patches updates and stuff because if we find

00:51:57.860 --> 00:52:03.920
<v Jonathan Ehwald>something internally uh which we're not happy with then we just fix it and that's how some releases

00:52:04.250 --> 00:52:11.960
<v Savannah Ostrowski>uh came out faster than once before dog fooding yeah that's awesome putting a lot yeah also all

00:52:11.980 --> 00:52:16.420
<v Jonathan Ehwald>all the related libraries like SQL model and others,

00:52:17.400 --> 00:52:18.500
<v Jonathan Ehwald>they experience the same thing.

00:52:18.560 --> 00:52:19.820
<v Sebastian Ramirez>- We're actually using everything now.

00:52:20.580 --> 00:52:21.780
<v Michael Kennedy>- Oh yeah, okay, that's cool.

00:52:22.360 --> 00:52:24.100
<v Sebastian Ramirez>- New library is coming out.

00:52:25.440 --> 00:52:26.240
<v Jonathan Ehwald>- That's also a thing.

00:52:26.680 --> 00:52:29.560
<v Jonathan Ehwald>Yeah, it's not just fast.jpi and friends.

00:52:30.460 --> 00:52:31.360
<v Jonathan Ehwald>We're like really open.

00:52:32.360 --> 00:52:34.940
<v Jonathan Ehwald>Recently, Patrick just open-sourced everything we use

00:52:35.040 --> 00:52:37.380
<v Jonathan Ehwald>for authentication authorization, for example.

00:52:37.720 --> 00:52:38.500
<v Jonathan Ehwald>Is it open-source yet?

00:52:39.100 --> 00:52:40.000
<v Jonathan Ehwald>Did they just fix something?

00:52:40.960 --> 00:52:42.380
<v Patrick Arminio>No, it is. Yeah, but no, no.

00:52:44.079 --> 00:52:44.820
<v Patrick Arminio>It will be.

00:52:45.120 --> 00:52:45.860
<v Jonathan Ehwald>Yeah, it doesn't make better.

00:52:46.100 --> 00:52:49.560
<v Jonathan Ehwald>But yeah, we build stuff internally in the moment really.

00:52:49.670 --> 00:52:52.880
<v Jonathan Ehwald>I like we build it in a way, like in a separate package,

00:52:53.320 --> 00:52:54.460
<v Jonathan Ehwald>just like an open source library.

00:52:54.560 --> 00:52:55.760
<v Jonathan Ehwald>And if we feel like the time is right,

00:52:55.860 --> 00:52:58.900
<v Jonathan Ehwald>it's just getting open sourced because a lot of things are reusable.

00:53:00.300 --> 00:53:01.460
<v Jonathan Ehwald>And that's in all departments.

00:53:01.840 --> 00:53:02.720
<v Jonathan Ehwald>Like that happens a lot.

00:53:02.840 --> 00:53:06.700
<v Jonathan Ehwald>Like when I started there, I already realized that,

00:53:06.710 --> 00:53:07.920
<v Jonathan Ehwald>like everyone was building open source,

00:53:08.100 --> 00:53:09.560
<v Jonathan Ehwald>but now I joined in myself as well.

00:53:09.680 --> 00:53:13.000
<v Jonathan Ehwald>I open source the library for compression,

00:53:13.540 --> 00:53:18.760
<v Jonathan Ehwald>like compressing and decompressing archives in Python.

00:53:19.860 --> 00:53:22.480
<v Jonathan Ehwald>Because the internal TAR5 thingy is just slow,

00:53:22.540 --> 00:53:24.240
<v Jonathan Ehwald>and we needed it to be faster because we're

00:53:24.440 --> 00:53:25.620
<v Jonathan Ehwald>stirring up the deployment process.

00:53:25.820 --> 00:53:26.740
<v Jonathan Ehwald>We're like, hey, we could probably

00:53:27.060 --> 00:53:28.180
<v Jonathan Ehwald>shape off a few seconds here.

00:53:29.220 --> 00:53:31.840
<v Jonathan Ehwald>And then that's just open source for everyone to use.

00:53:32.060 --> 00:53:35.060
<v Jonathan Ehwald>So we're contributing to the whole Python ecosystem as well.

00:53:35.100 --> 00:53:36.460
<v Sebastian Ramirez>You have to say the name.

00:53:36.680 --> 00:53:37.320
<v Sebastian Ramirez>It's so good.

00:53:38.420 --> 00:53:43.460
<v Jonathan Ehwald>Is it good? It's just it's faster because it's faster than just tar.

00:53:44.680 --> 00:53:46.200
<v Jonathan Ehwald>Fast tar. I love it.

00:53:46.400 --> 00:53:51.220
<v Sebastian Ramirez>Fast tar. You can say with that very German accent.

00:53:51.540 --> 00:53:51.760
<v Jonathan Ehwald>With the.

00:53:55.960 --> 00:53:57.680
<v Jonathan Ehwald>I could have, but you did it better.

00:53:58.830 --> 00:53:58.980
<v Jonathan Ehwald>Yeah.

00:53:59.860 --> 00:54:00.700
<v Jonathan Ehwald>I'm afraid to see.

00:54:01.420 --> 00:54:03.740
<v Jonathan Ehwald>I'm scared of leaking stuff from our deployments.

00:54:04.780 --> 00:54:06.180
<v Jonathan Ehwald>That's why I didn't say much.

00:54:06.220 --> 00:54:08.380
<v Michael Kennedy>Is that the FASTA or is this different?

00:54:08.680 --> 00:54:12.280
<v Jonathan Ehwald>No, it's literally the same name, but it's so fresh that, yeah,

00:54:12.500 --> 00:54:14.200
<v Jonathan Ehwald>I guess Google showed you this one instead.

00:54:14.820 --> 00:54:14.960
<v Michael Kennedy>Yeah.

00:54:15.500 --> 00:54:16.100
<v Michael Kennedy>Let's see.

00:54:16.400 --> 00:54:17.800
<v Savannah Ostrowski>Dr. John FASTA.

00:54:18.700 --> 00:54:18.860
<v Michael Kennedy>Yeah.

00:54:19.040 --> 00:54:19.340
<v Michael Kennedy>Okay.

00:54:20.820 --> 00:54:20.960
<v Sebastian Ramirez>Yeah.

00:54:21.460 --> 00:54:23.300
<v Sebastian Ramirez>But it's also like, you know, like we were-

00:54:23.440 --> 00:54:25.540
<v Savannah Ostrowski>Doctor, full name.

00:54:25.900 --> 00:54:26.240
<v Savannah Ostrowski>Full story.

00:54:26.360 --> 00:54:27.400
<v Savannah Ostrowski>Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:54:29.700 --> 00:54:30.660
<v Savannah Ostrowski>There you go.

00:54:31.160 --> 00:54:31.520
<v Jonathan Ehwald>One word.

00:54:31.520 --> 00:54:31.860
<v Jonathan Ehwald>Wow.

00:54:31.860 --> 00:54:33.420
<v Jonathan Ehwald>That's a lot of zeros.

00:54:34.220 --> 00:54:37.100
<v Savannah Ostrowski>You need to like SEO-ify this package, man.

00:54:37.260 --> 00:54:39.020
<v Michael Kennedy>I'm searching. I know. I'm searching on GitHub.

00:54:40.120 --> 00:54:41.680
<v Jonathan Ehwald>Why is that pull request now?

00:54:43.440 --> 00:54:44.520
<v Jonathan Ehwald>Am I that hard to find?

00:54:45.020 --> 00:54:45.640
<v Savannah Ostrowski>Oh my gosh.

00:54:46.120 --> 00:54:47.380
<v Michael Kennedy>Hold on, hold on, hold on.

00:54:48.200 --> 00:54:48.860
<v Michael Kennedy>It's in the Chelsea.

00:54:52.720 --> 00:54:53.840
<v Jonathan Ehwald>Yes, there we go.

00:54:54.140 --> 00:54:54.660
<v Michael Kennedy>Okay, okay.

00:54:55.840 --> 00:54:57.740
<v Michael Kennedy>The detective is at work. Here we go faster.

00:54:58.000 --> 00:54:59.240
<v Jonathan Ehwald>Yeah, it's already gone.

00:54:59.380 --> 00:55:01.200
<v Michael Kennedy>Well, I'm not logged in on this machine.

00:55:01.320 --> 00:55:02.820
<v Michael Kennedy>This is just my streaming, not my dev machine.

00:55:03.240 --> 00:55:05.900
<v Michael Kennedy>I'll go star it. We'll get you some stars.

00:55:08.200 --> 00:55:09.620
<v Jonathan Ehwald>That's the irony about it.

00:55:10.160 --> 00:55:11.280
<v Jonathan Ehwald>It literally has no stars,

00:55:11.500 --> 00:55:12.860
<v Jonathan Ehwald>but if you scroll down and you see the downloads,

00:55:13.200 --> 00:55:15.440
<v Jonathan Ehwald>that's going to prove we're actually using it.

00:55:16.220 --> 00:55:18.380
<v Michael Kennedy>Yeah, awesome. Super cool.

00:55:20.440 --> 00:55:24.340
<v Michael Kennedy>This is pretty neat. Yeah, I like it.

00:55:25.180 --> 00:55:26.220
<v Michael Kennedy>It's a little context manager.

00:55:29.360 --> 00:55:34.880
<v Jonathan Ehwald>It's almost working the same as the TAR file in the standard library,

00:55:35.180 --> 00:55:38.760
<v Jonathan Ehwald>like the same, like almost similar API to that.

00:55:39.340 --> 00:55:41.620
<v Jonathan Ehwald>It's basically a drop-in replacement, more or less.

00:55:42.820 --> 00:55:42.900
<v Michael Kennedy>Cool.

00:55:43.120 --> 00:55:44.960
<v Sebastian Ramirez>But then everything happens in Rust.

00:55:45.360 --> 00:55:45.760
<v Sebastian Ramirez>Because Rust.

00:55:46.360 --> 00:55:47.300
<v Michael Kennedy>Because it's fast.

00:55:47.580 --> 00:55:48.480
<v Sebastian Ramirez>Because Rust, yeah.

00:55:48.640 --> 00:55:50.240
<v Michael Kennedy>Well, as soon as it becomes infrastructure

00:55:51.260 --> 00:55:52.640
<v Michael Kennedy>and you've got to run it a million times,

00:55:53.200 --> 00:55:54.580
<v Michael Kennedy>that starts to make sense, right?

00:55:55.220 --> 00:55:55.280
<v Michael Kennedy>Yeah.

00:55:55.460 --> 00:55:58.760
<v Michael Kennedy>I mean, Python is one of the fastest programming languages

00:55:59.480 --> 00:56:04.120
<v Michael Kennedy>in the world when you think about human time

00:56:04.250 --> 00:56:05.400
<v Michael Kennedy>to build the things, right?

00:56:05.540 --> 00:56:07.360
<v Michael Kennedy>Like that's one of its real superpowers.

00:56:07.490 --> 00:56:09.700
<v Michael Kennedy>It's like, I mean, there's the whole story

00:56:11.850 --> 00:56:14.600
<v Michael Kennedy>of Google Video and YouTube, right?

00:56:14.690 --> 00:56:17.460
<v Michael Kennedy>And Google Video is written in C++ with 100 engineers,

00:56:17.690 --> 00:56:19.780
<v Michael Kennedy>and YouTube was a small team in Python.

00:56:19.990 --> 00:56:21.680
<v Michael Kennedy>And they just couldn't keep up with the features.

00:56:21.840 --> 00:56:23.900
<v Michael Kennedy>So they bought this little thing YouTube

00:56:24.040 --> 00:56:28.020
<v Michael Kennedy>and see if we're going to make something with it. And last I checked, it was still in Python. I'm

00:56:28.080 --> 00:56:34.000
<v Michael Kennedy>sure some of it isn't but a few years ago it was, which is wild. Anyway, there's different ways of

00:56:34.140 --> 00:56:38.920
<v Savannah Ostrowski>fast but when it's down to like little utilities. Yeah. I know. They're trying to make Python fast.

00:56:39.120 --> 00:56:47.720
<v Michael Kennedy>Yeah, I honestly massive success in the last five years, right? Yeah, yeah. Like since 311,

00:56:48.220 --> 00:56:53.880
<v Savannah Ostrowski>since the specializing adaptive interpreter has been pretty big. Yeah, 3.9 and 3.11 did a lot of

00:56:53.900 --> 00:56:58.320
<v Michael Kennedy>foundational work and then three nine onward really just uncorked a lot of innovation there

00:56:58.740 --> 00:57:04.960
<v Michael Kennedy>yeah yeah that's pretty awesome all right um it sounds like sebastian you've talked a lot about

00:57:05.140 --> 00:57:12.340
<v Michael Kennedy>kubernetes so i imagine kubernetes is happening uh do we get to pick what data centers it runs on do

00:57:12.380 --> 00:57:20.680
<v Michael Kennedy>we get to pick what clouds it runs on like you're going to get to pick some of these things not yet

00:57:20.760 --> 00:57:27.760
<v Sebastian Ramirez>is not released yet. But you know, like it's, so of course, like we have like regular 12 providers

00:57:27.920 --> 00:57:32.360
<v Sebastian Ramirez>in the middle and there's a bunch of Kubernetes, then there's a bunch of additional stuff that needs

00:57:32.500 --> 00:57:36.760
<v Sebastian Ramirez>to run on top. Then there's like custom Kubernetes controllers and things that

00:57:37.600 --> 00:57:43.260
<v Sebastian Ramirez>Jonathan was saying that he's having to write in Go so people in Python can be happy to be able to

00:57:43.840 --> 00:57:47.160
<v Sebastian Ramirez>you know, like manage all the Kubernetes shenanigans that need to happen because

00:57:47.180 --> 00:57:53.460
<v Sebastian Ramirez>there's so much complexity that needs to be handled and there's a lot of that we do a lot of

00:57:54.000 --> 00:57:58.800
<v Sebastian Ramirez>advanced tricks also jonathan was recently doing a bunch of advanced tricks to handle the caches

00:57:59.660 --> 00:58:05.720
<v Sebastian Ramirez>for the builds so the way that we handle caches and we also like tap into uv and how things work

00:58:05.900 --> 00:58:12.440
<v Sebastian Ramirez>so that builds can be super super fast because it's like something it's we are you know like we

00:58:12.460 --> 00:58:20.140
<v Sebastian Ramirez>are very much targeted at FastAPI and Python in general. So we can take advantage of knowing how

00:58:20.380 --> 00:58:25.160
<v Sebastian Ramirez>things run internally, how things are installed, how to optimize everything. So everything is just

00:58:25.240 --> 00:58:31.920
<v Michael Kennedy>like super fast, super fast. Yeah. I imagine you all have base Docker images that are like just

00:58:32.860 --> 00:58:39.020
<v Michael Kennedy>one one layer away from whoever's code is running. You know, like you've got it all

00:58:39.020 --> 00:58:43.360
<v Michael Kennedy>already pre-built with FastAPI and whatever settings of Python you want.

00:58:43.900 --> 00:58:50.280
<v Sebastian Ramirez>Yeah. Like a bunch of things and tricks. Yeah. But also like different things,

00:58:50.500 --> 00:58:55.260
<v Sebastian Ramirez>like the different ways that we do to actually build the things and install things and put them

00:58:55.560 --> 00:59:01.980
<v Sebastian Ramirez>inside of the actual, you know, like build application. There's like a lot of sourcing

00:59:02.720 --> 00:59:08.100
<v Sebastian Ramirez>that we do there and like Jonathan has been like working on a lot of that. And there's also all the

00:59:07.900 --> 00:59:12.760
<v Sebastian Ramirez>logic and all the stuff we have a bunch of stuff on top of that to handle auto scaling which is

00:59:12.860 --> 00:59:18.700
<v Sebastian Ramirez>something that is actually not that easy to find in different providers we have auto scaling based

00:59:18.840 --> 00:59:25.180
<v Sebastian Ramirez>on requests including scaling down to zero which saves costs but it's you know like this is not

00:59:25.300 --> 00:59:30.980
<v Sebastian Ramirez>lambdas it's not aws lambdas it's we are like it's like the full uh deployed application the full

00:59:31.220 --> 00:59:36.680
<v Sebastian Ramirez>container or whatever it is uh which is you know like the full thing with all the dependencies is

00:59:36.700 --> 00:59:42.240
<v Sebastian Ramirez>running for whenever it has to run, but we can scale based on requests. So it's like, I guess

00:59:42.360 --> 00:59:49.700
<v Sebastian Ramirez>it's like the type of thing that you will have if you have this giant cluster for a huge enterprise

00:59:50.220 --> 00:59:57.720
<v Sebastian Ramirez>with a bunch of infra people making sure everything just works perfectly, but you just pay us to do

00:59:57.840 --> 01:00:05.780
<v Savannah Ostrowski>that for you. Yeah. But I think this is also a good time for us to probably say lots of stuff is

01:00:05.740 --> 01:00:07.260
<v Savannah Ostrowski>is coming and we're in private beta.

01:00:07.460 --> 01:00:09.300
<v Savannah Ostrowski>And so you should sign up for the wait list

01:00:10.760 --> 01:00:12.140
<v Savannah Ostrowski>so that you can get admitted

01:00:12.220 --> 01:00:14.460
<v Savannah Ostrowski>and try out these very cool things we've been talking about.

01:00:14.460 --> 01:00:15.260
<v Michael Kennedy>Yeah, absolutely.

01:00:15.560 --> 01:00:19.900
<v Michael Kennedy>And I think I'll let Tech Insider out in the audience

01:00:21.280 --> 01:00:22.120
<v Michael Kennedy>sort of lead to this.

01:00:22.120 --> 01:00:22.760
<v Savannah Ostrowski>Public release when?

01:00:23.440 --> 01:00:27.260
<v Michael Kennedy>Yeah, lead us into my final topic,

01:00:27.460 --> 01:00:28.640
<v Michael Kennedy>which is just what's the roadmap?

01:00:29.220 --> 01:00:29.940
<v Michael Kennedy>When is this stuff?

01:00:30.440 --> 01:00:32.820
<v Michael Kennedy>How do we get into it here?

01:00:34.260 --> 01:00:45.820
<v Jonathan Ehwald>So right now we have the waiting list and we are onboarding people.

01:00:45.860 --> 01:00:48.400
<v Sebastian Ramirez>We already have like a bunch of people in the private beta.

01:00:48.820 --> 01:00:53.960
<v Sebastian Ramirez>We are going to keep onboarding people from the waiting list and like, you know, like wrap that up.

01:00:54.060 --> 01:00:58.520
<v Sebastian Ramirez>But it will be like, you know, like through the waiting list is the main place where we are onboarding people.

01:00:58.640 --> 01:01:02.600
<v Sebastian Ramirez>We want to make sure that everything is super fine tuned and we're going to keep it that way for a while.

01:01:02.660 --> 01:01:09.160
<v Sebastian Ramirez>So people that are on the waiting list are going to be the ones that are going to be able to start using it the soonest.

01:01:09.490 --> 01:01:13.180
<v Sebastian Ramirez>At some point, we'll probably have ways for people to invite others and things like that.

01:01:15.340 --> 01:01:23.780
<v Sebastian Ramirez>About the things that we are building, we are super focused on FastAPI and then Python in general.

01:01:23.920 --> 01:01:27.320
<v Sebastian Ramirez>at some point will probably support different tools,

01:01:27.810 --> 01:01:31.320
<v Sebastian Ramirez>different ways to run, like Python code in general,

01:01:31.560 --> 01:01:32.600
<v Sebastian Ramirez>probably different frameworks.

01:01:33.120 --> 01:01:37.980
<v Sebastian Ramirez>It will also depend a lot on what the users are asking for,

01:01:38.080 --> 01:01:41.020
<v Sebastian Ramirez>where are the tools, the frameworks, the use cases,

01:01:41.190 --> 01:01:42.420
<v Sebastian Ramirez>the things that they need to build.

01:01:42.580 --> 01:01:45.620
<v Sebastian Ramirez>And we're gonna evolve the platform and the system

01:01:46.200 --> 01:01:48.840
<v Sebastian Ramirez>based on what people need out of it.

01:01:49.420 --> 01:01:53.040
<v Savannah Ostrowski>- Yeah, and we have a GitHub repo where we have issues,

01:01:53.240 --> 01:01:57.540
<v Savannah Ostrowski>But we also have like a Slack that once people are admitted, they can talk directly to us.

01:01:57.660 --> 01:02:04.080
<v Savannah Ostrowski>And that feedback is really, really valuable for shaping the roadmap and figuring out all the fun things you want us to support.

01:02:04.680 --> 01:02:05.120
<v Michael Kennedy>Yeah.

01:02:05.790 --> 01:02:05.900
<v Michael Kennedy>Awesome.

01:02:07.700 --> 01:02:09.080
<v Michael Kennedy>Of course, you're going to charge money for it.

01:02:09.630 --> 01:02:13.640
<v Michael Kennedy>It runs on the servers and you guys are not a charity.

01:02:16.420 --> 01:02:17.500
<v Michael Kennedy>But I don't know.

01:02:17.950 --> 01:02:22.320
<v Michael Kennedy>Can you give any sense of what you're thinking about that kind of stuff?

01:02:22.520 --> 01:02:23.960
<v Michael Kennedy>or join the waitlist and see?

01:02:25.220 --> 01:02:30.580
<v Sebastian Ramirez>Well, first join the waitlist and see, but we don't have like that predefined yet,

01:02:31.440 --> 01:02:34.980
<v Sebastian Ramirez>but it will be on the ballpark of what you could get from different cloud providers.

01:02:35.080 --> 01:02:44.100
<v Sebastian Ramirez>So like, you know, like different similar-ish providers will be on the ballpark of what you will get.

01:02:45.200 --> 01:02:48.240
<v Sebastian Ramirez>But it's not written in stone yet.

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:53.780
<v Sebastian Ramirez>It's still a little bit different because we can auto scale based on requests.

01:02:54.080 --> 01:02:58.140
<v Sebastian Ramirez>So we can increase the amount of replicas of your application automatically.

01:02:59.100 --> 01:03:02.240
<v Sebastian Ramirez>And then we can decrease them automatically and we can scale down to zero.

01:03:02.860 --> 01:03:08.840
<v Sebastian Ramirez>So you can probably handle all the load that you need and in the end spend a lot less because

01:03:08.860 --> 01:03:12.420
<v Sebastian Ramirez>you don't have to have a bunch of instances constantly running or things like that.

01:03:13.220 --> 01:03:19.340
<v Sebastian Ramirez>So it will probably work a little bit different than what it will be for other providers.

01:03:19.880 --> 01:03:22.140
<v Sebastian Ramirez>But in the end, it should be roughly similar.

01:03:22.840 --> 01:03:23.220
<v Michael Kennedy>Okay.

01:03:23.900 --> 01:03:29.840
<v Michael Kennedy>And given the fact that you all handle so much of it as a platform as a service type of thing,

01:03:30.860 --> 01:03:36.280
<v Michael Kennedy>you don't have to have a cloud expert on hand or a DevOps expert necessarily, right?

01:03:36.500 --> 01:03:43.800
<v Michael Kennedy>it's soon as a company has to hire somebody to be an AWS cloud architect or something like that.

01:03:44.580 --> 01:03:51.500
<v Sebastian Ramirez>It's no longer just what is your AWS bill, right? Yeah. Yeah. And it's, yeah, it's also,

01:03:52.060 --> 01:03:55.480
<v Sebastian Ramirez>it's also a lot of the pain that we are swallowing. So you don't have to.

01:03:56.330 --> 01:03:58.880
<v Michael Kennedy>Exactly. It's part of taking one for the team, right? Yes.

01:04:00.740 --> 01:04:08.120
<v Michael Kennedy>Indeed. All right. So I had one or two things specifically that I was seeing is like

01:04:09.620 --> 01:04:13.880
<v Michael Kennedy>custom domains. How far off are custom domains? I was like, oh, I could put some cool things

01:04:13.960 --> 01:04:21.600
<v Michael Kennedy>on there. I could tell Jonathan is psyched about this. I was like, I would be really

01:04:21.800 --> 01:04:28.380
<v Michael Kennedy>fun to put one of my really small FastAPI projects over there. You know, something I

01:04:28.340 --> 01:04:31.440
<v Michael Kennedy>set up for some of my courses or something that I can like point people to go

01:04:31.520 --> 01:04:34.880
<v Michael Kennedy>look, it's running FastAPI cloud on it, you guys can check that out over there.

01:04:35.660 --> 01:04:36.960
<v Michael Kennedy>And I like, but it's on its own domain.

01:04:37.100 --> 01:04:41.500
<v Michael Kennedy>And those that domain is baked into the course videos, you know what I mean?

01:04:41.580 --> 01:04:42.820
<v Michael Kennedy>And it's, it's written in stone.

01:04:42.980 --> 01:04:43.360
<v Michael Kennedy>It's marketing.

01:04:44.260 --> 01:04:45.380
<v Michael Kennedy>Yeah, exactly.

01:04:45.740 --> 01:04:52.440
<v Michael Kennedy>So,  so I can't really move it because it has, you know, some sub domain

01:04:52.560 --> 01:04:53.220
<v Michael Kennedy>of talk Python, right?

01:04:55.380 --> 01:04:55.640
<v Michael Kennedy>Jonathan.

01:04:57.880 --> 01:04:59.160
<v Sebastian Ramirez>I was going to say that work.

01:04:59.900 --> 01:05:03.100
<v Jonathan Ehwald>See, I was working on it and then I got the notification by Google

01:05:03.300 --> 01:05:05.540
<v Jonathan Ehwald>calendars that I should join a certain podcast.

01:05:06.080 --> 01:05:08.560
<v Michael Kennedy>Are you telling me we don't have custom domains?

01:05:08.960 --> 01:05:10.980
<v Michael Kennedy>Because I'm here asking you about custom domains.

01:05:11.030 --> 01:05:11.780
<v Michael Kennedy>How meta is that?

01:05:11.790 --> 01:05:12.180
<v Michael Kennedy>You got it.

01:05:12.610 --> 01:05:12.720
<v Jonathan Ehwald>Yeah.

01:05:14.460 --> 01:05:18.420
<v Jonathan Ehwald>It could be here already, but no, you have to wait a bit more.

01:05:19.160 --> 01:05:20.160
<v Michael Kennedy>OK, but soon?

01:05:21.020 --> 01:05:21.460
<v Jonathan Ehwald>Yes.

01:05:21.710 --> 01:05:21.840
<v Jonathan Ehwald>Yeah.

01:05:22.200 --> 01:05:22.360
<v Michael Kennedy>Yeah.

01:05:23.220 --> 01:05:26.640
<v Jonathan Ehwald>Soon is broad enough, but I'm actively working on it.

01:05:27.120 --> 01:05:28.300
<v Jonathan Ehwald>Let's put it like that.

01:05:28.800 --> 01:05:28.900
<v Jonathan Ehwald>Awesome.

01:05:30.420 --> 01:05:31.180
<v Michael Kennedy>Okay, that sounds great.

01:05:31.420 --> 01:05:35.500
<v Michael Kennedy>And then, I mean, I just, it's never simple.

01:05:35.840 --> 01:05:39.240
<v Michael Kennedy>You know, I just, I set up some stuff and it's like, you get the pop-up.

01:05:39.560 --> 01:05:47.220
<v Michael Kennedy>Oh, you got to put this, you know, this TXT record, this CNAME or whatever record into your DNS and then we're checking it.

01:05:47.260 --> 01:05:50.060
<v Michael Kennedy>Oh, it might take three days for your DNS to propagate.

01:05:50.280 --> 01:05:53.200
<v Michael Kennedy>So hang in there and just, I can imagine like you're having fun.

01:05:54.040 --> 01:05:54.780
<v Jonathan Ehwald>Yeah, I guess.

01:05:55.180 --> 01:05:55.580
<v Jonathan Ehwald>Yeah.

01:05:56.320 --> 01:05:58.700
<v Jonathan Ehwald>Yeah, that's like, wow.

01:05:58.920 --> 01:06:02.240
<v Jonathan Ehwald>I thought I'm almost off work, but no, you're bringing it all back.

01:06:02.420 --> 01:06:03.060
<v Jonathan Ehwald>I'm sorry.

01:06:04.560 --> 01:06:09.180
<v Michael Kennedy>I'm sure the company could support therapy to work through the issues

01:06:09.260 --> 01:06:11.080
<v Michael Kennedy>and the trauma that you've suffered from the DNS.

01:06:12.080 --> 01:06:12.880
<v Michael Kennedy>It's always DNS.

01:06:13.160 --> 01:06:13.340
<v Michael Kennedy>That's right.

01:06:13.420 --> 01:06:14.320
<v Michael Kennedy>It's always DNS.

01:06:14.860 --> 01:06:15.700
<v Michael Kennedy>Yes, it's always DNS.

01:06:16.420 --> 01:06:20.460
<v Patrick Arminio>One of our goals with custom domains is also to make it super simple

01:06:20.500 --> 01:06:21.600
<v Patrick Arminio>for you to set up them.

01:06:22.260 --> 01:06:27.340
<v Patrick Arminio>Like, for example, if you're using one of the providers that support OAuth,

01:06:27.370 --> 01:06:30.120
<v Patrick Arminio>we can also just do one click, and then it's going to be automatically.

01:06:30.190 --> 01:06:31.840
<v Patrick Arminio>Oh, that's cool. Yeah, yeah, that's really nice.

01:06:32.440 --> 01:06:34.580
<v Patrick Arminio>But unfortunately, it depends on the platform you're using,

01:06:34.660 --> 01:06:36.600
<v Patrick Arminio>because all of them support this.

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:40.700
<v Michael Kennedy>Yeah, just a shout-out for people out there.

01:06:40.920 --> 01:06:43.000
<v Sebastian Ramirez>This is made by the person in charge of most of the integrations.

01:06:43.110 --> 01:06:47.500
<v Sebastian Ramirez>So Patrick has built, we have integrations for a bunch of database providers

01:06:47.670 --> 01:06:48.260
<v Sebastian Ramirez>and things like that.

01:06:48.520 --> 01:06:53.360
<v Sebastian Ramirez>Patrick, I think now Patrick knows by memory the open ID specification.

01:06:53.720 --> 01:06:54.120
<v Sebastian Ramirez>I don't know.

01:06:57.180 --> 01:07:00.020
<v Michael Kennedy>Yeah, the other thing I wanted to talk a bit about was just integrations,

01:07:00.180 --> 01:07:01.660
<v Michael Kennedy>like what kind of stuff you guys have come in.

01:07:01.700 --> 01:07:05.200
<v Michael Kennedy>I saw that Hugging Face is going to be integrated soon.

01:07:05.400 --> 01:07:09.320
<v Michael Kennedy>You've got Supabase, which is kind of Postgres as a service.

01:07:10.240 --> 01:07:15.480
<v Michael Kennedy>There's a lot of those things out there that theoretically could be added.

01:07:16.620 --> 01:07:19.900
<v Patrick Arminio>Yeah, I mean, someone also asked for MongoDB.

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:22.100
<v Patrick Arminio>Maybe that's one that we're going to take a look into.

01:07:22.300 --> 01:07:24.780
<v Patrick Arminio>It really depends on the provider.

01:07:24.920 --> 01:07:27.640
<v Patrick Arminio>So at the moment, we don't want to ask databases for you

01:07:27.800 --> 01:07:29.800
<v Patrick Arminio>because that's also another kind of rabbit hole.

01:07:30.920 --> 01:07:32.300
<v Patrick Arminio>Jonathan is probably not ready for that.

01:07:34.180 --> 01:07:36.180
<v Patrick Arminio>But yeah, definitely like databases.

01:07:36.320 --> 01:07:38.220
<v Patrick Arminio>But I guess we can say that we also

01:07:38.640 --> 01:07:41.640
<v Patrick Arminio>talking with the people from Pydantic

01:07:41.740 --> 01:07:44.080
<v Patrick Arminio>so we can integrate maybe Logfire automatically,

01:07:44.500 --> 01:07:45.040
<v Patrick Arminio>that kind of stuff.

01:07:46.980 --> 01:07:47.200
<v Patrick Arminio>Yeah.

01:07:47.420 --> 01:07:50.880
<v Patrick Arminio>And also like Redis, which is also another kind of database

01:07:51.820 --> 01:07:52.740
<v Patrick Arminio>that's also coming soon.

01:07:54.060 --> 01:07:56.740
<v Michael Kennedy>- Yeah, there's a couple of database as a service

01:07:58.160 --> 01:08:00.020
<v Michael Kennedy>type things that don't require too much

01:08:00.080 --> 01:08:04.160
<v Michael Kennedy>other than just connecting API keys

01:08:04.260 --> 01:08:05.200
<v Michael Kennedy>and something like that, right?

01:08:05.440 --> 01:08:06.640
<v Michael Kennedy>Those seem like low hanging fruit.

01:08:07.400 --> 01:08:11.680
<v Patrick Arminio>- Yeah, so like the kind of goal with the integration

01:08:11.940 --> 01:08:13.780
<v Patrick Arminio>is not just like, yeah, right now,

01:08:13.860 --> 01:08:15.360
<v Patrick Arminio>It's just setting up an environment variable.

01:08:16.279 --> 01:08:19.100
<v Patrick Arminio>But the idea is also to do more--

01:08:21.150 --> 01:08:23.500
<v Patrick Arminio>I don't know-- the proper integration, I would say.

01:08:24.460 --> 01:08:26.500
<v Patrick Arminio>For example, for things like Superbase,

01:08:27.470 --> 01:08:28.640
<v Patrick Arminio>yeah, I think that support branching.

01:08:29.020 --> 01:08:32.359
<v Patrick Arminio>For example, once we support Procrast previews for GitHub,

01:08:32.700 --> 01:08:34.580
<v Patrick Arminio>we can also create a branch automatically for you

01:08:34.670 --> 01:08:36.620
<v Patrick Arminio>if you have the Superbase integration enabled.

01:08:37.020 --> 01:08:38.799
<v Patrick Arminio>And we can do this kind of stuff as well.

01:08:38.980 --> 01:08:42.680
<v Patrick Arminio>Or even we could show some information about database,

01:08:42.960 --> 01:08:45.560
<v Patrick Arminio>I don't know, like load or like memory usage,

01:08:45.660 --> 01:08:47.279
<v Patrick Arminio>things are directly from our dashboard.

01:08:47.339 --> 01:08:48.220
<v Patrick Arminio>So you don't have to go there.

01:08:48.920 --> 01:08:50.920
<v Patrick Arminio>That's the main reason why we're building this

01:08:52.140 --> 01:08:53.880
<v Patrick Arminio>infrastructure for the integration.

01:08:54.900 --> 01:08:55.400
<v Michael Kennedy>- All right.

01:08:56.960 --> 01:08:59.120
<v Michael Kennedy>Well, people can sign up to the waiting list

01:08:59.319 --> 01:09:02.339
<v Michael Kennedy>and hopefully get on the private beta and...

01:09:03.660 --> 01:09:05.140
<v Sebastian Ramirez>- We actually check the waiting list.

01:09:05.140 --> 01:09:08.040
<v Sebastian Ramirez>We actually check the use cases, theme sizes,

01:09:08.299 --> 01:09:10.380
<v Sebastian Ramirez>like what are people building with it.

01:09:10.400 --> 01:09:12.419
<v Sebastian Ramirez>Like we actually go and check it

01:09:12.440 --> 01:09:16.520
<v Sebastian Ramirez>and we bring in people from the waiting list.

01:09:16.859 --> 01:09:19.120
<v Michael Kennedy>Nice. I didn't join the waiting list directly.

01:09:19.359 --> 01:09:25.319
<v Michael Kennedy>I was added by some guy I know who was very kind to help me get some behind the scene look.

01:09:26.140 --> 01:09:27.220
<v Michael Kennedy>I don't know what the process is.

01:09:27.290 --> 01:09:32.140
<v Michael Kennedy>Do you actually say what you want to do with it and you evaluate that a little bit as well based on like,

01:09:32.150 --> 01:09:34.200
<v Michael Kennedy>hey, this would be a cool use case for us to support?

01:09:35.440 --> 01:09:36.359
<v Sebastian Ramirez>Yes, yes, of course.

01:09:36.450 --> 01:09:41.199
<v Sebastian Ramirez>Because there are many types of applications and

01:09:41.220 --> 01:09:46.560
<v Sebastian Ramirez>many types of different team sizes, many types of things that people might want to build.

01:09:46.700 --> 01:09:52.400
<v Sebastian Ramirez>And we try to see, like, okay, where is the case where we could be, like, a good fit and we can provide a great service?

01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:54.880
<v Sebastian Ramirez>And what are the things that people are trying to build?

01:09:55.440 --> 01:10:03.420
<v Sebastian Ramirez>Also, it helps us see, like, you know, like, what are people trying to do with FastAPI Cloud so that we know what we have to provide?

01:10:04.440 --> 01:10:11.020
<v Sebastian Ramirez>But we actually go and check those submissions.

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:20.760
<v Sebastian Ramirez>It's actually thousands of people in the waiting list, but we still go and check and approve kind of manually.

01:10:21.940 --> 01:10:22.060
<v Sebastian Ramirez>Yeah.

01:10:22.260 --> 01:10:26.600
<v Sebastian Ramirez>To bring a bunch of people on board in the different ways that we have been bringing people.

01:10:26.960 --> 01:10:32.220
<v Sebastian Ramirez>So if people go and join the waiting list and actually tell us what is their use case, their team,

01:10:32.360 --> 01:10:37.700
<v Sebastian Ramirez>like what are they planning on doing, there's a much higher chance that we are going to

01:10:38.020 --> 01:10:39.400
<v Sebastian Ramirez>go and just like bring them up.

01:10:39.960 --> 01:10:40.400
<v Michael Kennedy>Okay.

01:10:41.310 --> 01:10:41.420
<v Michael Kennedy>Awesome.

01:10:42.040 --> 01:10:45.880
<v Michael Kennedy>So, everyone, go join the waitlist if you're doing FastAPI.

01:10:46.560 --> 01:10:48.880
<v Michael Kennedy>I'll link to it in the show notes, of course.

01:10:51.040 --> 01:10:54.680
<v Michael Kennedy>Thank you all for being here and sharing the story.

01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:58.960
<v Michael Kennedy>And I, for one, am very excited to see FastAPI Cloud exist.

01:11:00.380 --> 01:11:05.380
<v Michael Kennedy>just one more way to make FastAPI stronger and more resilient and so on.

01:11:06.780 --> 01:11:08.700
<v Sebastian Ramirez>Thank you very much. Thank you for having us.

01:11:09.120 --> 01:11:10.060
<v Savannah Ostrowski>Yeah, thanks for having us.

01:11:11.020 --> 01:11:12.520
<v Savannah Ostrowski>Yeah, you bet. Bye, everyone.

01:11:13.200 --> 01:11:13.720
<v Savannah Ostrowski>Bye, folks.

01:11:13.960 --> 01:11:14.040
<v Savannah Ostrowski>Bye.
