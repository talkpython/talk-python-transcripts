WEBVTT

00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:08.880
20 years after a scrappy newsroom team hacked together a framework to ship stories fast, Django remains the Python web framework that ships real apps responsibly.

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:25.700
In this anniversary roundtable with its creators and longtime stewards, Simon Wilson, Adrian Holovaty, Will Vincent, Jeff Triplett, and Tiavod Kolas, we trace the path from the Lawrence Journal world to version 1.0, DjangoCon, and the Django Software Foundation.

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:35.100
Unpack how a BSD license and a culture of docs, tests, and mentorship grew a global community, and revisit lessons from deployments like Instagram.

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:48.260
We talk modern Django too, ASGI and async, HTMX-friendly patterns, building APIs with DRF and Django Ninja, and how Django pairs with React and Serverless without losing its batteries-included soul.

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:56.580
You'll hear about Django Girls, Django Nauts, and the Django Fellowship that keeps momentum going, plus where Django fits in today's AI stacks.

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.360
Finally, we look ahead at the next decade of speed, security, and sustainability for Django.

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.780
This is Talk Python To Me, episode 518, recorded August 18th, 2025.

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:25.480
It's time to unite. We started in Pyramid cruising. Welcome to Talk Python To Me, a weekly podcast

00:01:25.860 --> 00:02:36.740
on Python. This is your host, Michael Kennedy. Follow me on Mastodon where I'm @mkennedy and follow the podcast using @talkpython, both accounts over at fosstodon.org and keep up with the show and listen to over nine years of episodes at talkpython.fm. If you want to be part of our live episodes, you can find the live streams over on YouTube. Subscribe to our YouTube channel over at talkpython.fm/youtube and get notified about upcoming shows. This episode is brought to you entirely by Sentry. It's a bit of an episode takeover, if you will. Sentry has two excellent and exciting services to tell you about. Sear, your agentic AI debugging assistant, which takes all the data already gathered by Sentry to help discover the problems and even propose fixes as GitHub PRs. And the other is AI agent monitoring, which adds deep observability to your AI agents in your app. If you're adding AI and LLM features to your Python apps, you'll want to know about AI agent monitoring. I'll tell you more about both of these later in the episode. And remember, however you happen to sign up for Sentry, if you do, use our code TALKPYTHON, one word, all caps.

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:38.100
Let's get to the interview.

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:39.560
Hello, everyone.

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:41.600
Welcome to Talk Python To Me.

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:45.840
I'm so excited to be celebrating Django's 20th birthday.

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:46.720
What a milestone.

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:51.860
We have Will Vincent, we have Adrian, we have Theobald, Jeff, we have Simon.

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:56.780
Many of the original people have the origin of Django here to talk about it.

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:58.240
So, you know, welcome all of you.

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.880
Thanks, Michael.

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:00.140
Yeah, you bet.

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:06.360
It's going to be a lot of fun to go back to some stories and maybe also see where things are going after 20 years.

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:08.840
It's still going strong, to be sure.

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:10.020
So what an accomplishment.

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:15.000
Let's just start with a real quick, who am I, introduction from each of you.

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:18.480
Just give us the elevator pitch on you and your Django life.

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:21.440
And we'll go around the Brady Bunches in order, I suppose, here on the screen.

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:22.980
So Will, welcome.

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:23.240
Okay.

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:24.720
So we'll go from least to most important.

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:30.120
So I'm a developer advocate at JetBrains, some Django books, a podcast.

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:31.940
I think that's enough.

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:33.580
We have more important people to come.

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:34.080
All right.

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:35.080
Adrian, welcome.

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:37.160
First time to have you on the show. Happy to have you.

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:44.940
Hi, I'm Adrian, one of the creators of Django many years ago, precisely 20, a long time web developer.

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:46.660
And yeah, it's basically it.

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:50.400
I'm Simon. I'm Adrian's intern, effectively.

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:56.680
We built the first version of Django during my year long paid internship at the Longest Journal World in Kansas.

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:01.260
It was my university had a year in industry thing, which meant I could get a visa.

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:05.160
And yeah, we worked on what we called the CMS at the time.

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:07.040
We didn't know that it was a web framework.

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:09.120
We thought it was a tool for building local newspaper.

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:09.820
Yeah.

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:11.900
Almost got named TPS, which would be amazing.

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:13.920
Well, I'm a...

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:15.000
Oh, go ahead.

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:15.360
Sorry.

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:19.980
I was going to say, Simon, you're almost more well-known for your AI stuff these days.

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:20.720
You've been...

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:21.400
Last couple of years.

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:23.240
Like, last two years.

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:24.480
You've been in the news so much.

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:25.580
I see you everywhere now.

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:28.340
It's like, congratulations on having two...

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:28.840
Yeah.

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:30.099
I mean, that was...

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:44.560
was. The trick there is I have a blog and not everyone else gave up on blogging, but I kept going. And so when AI started up, I was the only person blogging about AI, which turns out gets you invited to all of the weird Silicon Valley mansion parties and things. So yeah, that's been an

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:48.580
interesting little twist over the past couple of years. Yeah. Jeff Triplett, I'm so sorry to cut

00:04:48.580 --> 00:05:00.660
you off. Happy to have you. No, no, no. All good. I thought it was pretty free for him, but I came to Lawrence, Kansas two years after these two had left, maybe three years after these two had left To work at the newspaper, I've stuck around.

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:03.760
Probably one of the few people left that stuck around that worked at the journal world.

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:05.660
Me and Frank Wiles, who's over here someplace.

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:08.240
I'm on the Django Software Foundation Board of Directors.

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:11.320
I've helped with DjangoCon US for, I think, 11 years now.

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:14.880
And do a newsletter with Will and a bunch of random Django projects.

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:15.940
So that's me.

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:18.080
Jeff, were you there for the whole of Media for Media?

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:21.660
The commercial arm of the newspaper doing Django stuff?

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:23.560
About three years of it.

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:27.280
It just had moved across the street to the Little Red building they called Little Red.

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:32.840
And so I think I moved when I moved here was within probably like a month or two of that starting in the building.

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:37.000
Awesome. I'd love to I'd love to hear little stories from that era of Django.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:37.840
I missed that entirely.

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:44.120
I'm on the board with Jeff. I'm the president of the foundation, Django Software Foundation for 2025.

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:49.080
And I've been involved with Django for only 10 years, only 10 years.

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:50.840
So much less than everyone is here.

00:05:51.910 --> 00:05:53.440
Yeah. Outside that, I'm a dev.

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:59.120
I'm on the core team for an open source project called Wagtail, which is a CMS as well built on Django.

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:00.500
Yeah, welcome.

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:03.080
And Wagtail is a really cool project.

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:08.300
I think people who are looking to take the CMS idea and level it up even more.

00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:13.180
And you know, I've got a little bit of Wagtail related career history.

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:15.400
Wagtail came out of a company called Torchbox.

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:23.720
I worked for Torchbox for about six months to a year quite early on, working on one of the first Django projects that Torchbox worked on.

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:26.080
And it was a carbon calculator that we were building.

00:06:26.290 --> 00:06:27.740
I have nothing to do with Wagtail at all.

00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:29.520
That was probably 10 years after I left Torchbox.

00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:31.560
But I know the Torchbox team really well.

00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:36.060
We should also, I mean, Jeff, amongst other things, you run Django packages.org right now.

00:06:36.130 --> 00:06:40.520
And I think Wagtail is number one or two with Django REST framework for most downloaded.

00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:41.720
It's something like that.

00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:42.600
It's one of the top three.

00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:44.100
I feel confident saying that.

00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:44.800
Maybe you don't.

00:06:44.910 --> 00:06:45.120
I do.

00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:47.620
Yeah, it's downloaded a lot.

00:06:47.730 --> 00:06:49.220
I don't know if it's top 25.

00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:50.000
Tebow with it.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:50.920
I think it's in the top 100.

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:51.760
We did a post, right?

00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:52.740
So, you know, you're close.

00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:53.380
Okay, Tebow.

00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:54.820
Amongst 20,000 or so plus.

00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:56.620
But, yeah.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:57.880
Yeah, yeah, of Django ones.

00:06:58.220 --> 00:06:59.660
Wait, of Django ones?

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:00.280
Oh.

00:07:00.670 --> 00:07:00.980
What is that?

00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:02.460
There's like 4,000 now, Jeff?

00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:03.260
Something like that?

00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:06.360
I think there's probably like 16,000, 20,000.

00:07:06.470 --> 00:07:09.520
But I think we're tracking like the top 4,000 or 5,000.

00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:11.320
It's what people...

00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:12.180
I never wanted to add code.

00:07:12.210 --> 00:07:14.320
They just pulled everything in just to have a lot of numbers.

00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:17.600
So, it's still like user submitted and ran.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:19.180
Oh, it is the most important thing.

00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:20.060
But Tebow, GitHub stars.

00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:21.180
That's the most important thing.

00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:22.320
How many is it for Wagtail?

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:25.120
But yeah, I think we just like almost at 20,000.

00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:30.320
I'm pretty sure if you're on here listening to this show, stars right now will be at 20,000 in like a week.

00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:32.740
Yeah, it's really high in downloads as well.

00:07:32.780 --> 00:07:37.680
But you know, the Django ecosystem is really big these days and CMS only definitely in a smaller portion of it.

00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:38.260
Oh, there you go.

00:07:38.660 --> 00:07:40.160
Very, very, very popular.

00:07:40.420 --> 00:07:40.980
That's amazing.

00:07:41.420 --> 00:07:43.600
So let's start at the beginning, folks.

00:07:43.900 --> 00:07:50.080
I have on the screen here a picture of the University of Kansas where I also have a connection to.

00:07:50.140 --> 00:07:54.460
I actually went here and got my undergraduate degree in math at this school.

00:07:54.500 --> 00:07:56.080
And I love my time in Lawrence.

00:07:56.200 --> 00:08:02.480
I think it's a lovely town, but it's also the home of Lawrence Journal World, right?

00:08:02.860 --> 00:08:05.060
Tell us who wants to start the story.

00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:07.220
Like what's the origin story here?

00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:09.580
Probably it makes sense for me to start it.

00:08:09.820 --> 00:08:10.640
Yeah, I think so.

00:08:10.780 --> 00:08:11.200
Let's do it.

00:08:11.420 --> 00:08:18.300
Back in 2002 slash 2003, early 2003, I joined that newspaper as a web developer.

00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:24.960
There was the guy who ran it was this guy called Rob Curley, who was seen as this big tech innovator in the news industry.

00:08:25.090 --> 00:08:35.000
And he was sort of recruited me and put together a great team of awesome, awesome web developers, believe it or not, in this tiny little newspaper in the middle of Kansas.

00:08:35.900 --> 00:08:42.900
We were tasked with building interactive database driven apps for the newspaper, which at that time was unheard of.

00:08:43.050 --> 00:08:46.780
Even these days, it's kind of weird for a newspaper to have developers on its staff.

00:08:48.020 --> 00:09:03.500
And at the time I was using PHP and yeah, fast forward, maybe a year into the job, we had an opening to hire another developer and I posted a job entry on my blog and Simon read it all the way in the UK.

00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:08.340
And we followed each other's blogs back when that was like the social media of the day.

00:09:08.690 --> 00:09:09.280
To be fair.

00:09:09.370 --> 00:09:11.500
Much more interesting than social media of today.

00:09:11.800 --> 00:09:16.300
At the time, I felt like there were about 100 people blogging about web development.

00:09:16.580 --> 00:09:17.360
And we were two of those.

00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:19.700
Yeah, and we all followed everyone.

00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:21.920
Did you guys have a blog role?

00:09:22.440 --> 00:09:23.460
Oh, yeah, absolutely.

00:09:25.079 --> 00:09:27.620
I think we were both massive fans of Mark Pilgrim.

00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:33.140
Mark Pilgrim was the web development of Python blogger that we were paying attention to.

00:09:33.420 --> 00:09:34.720
Unfortunately, he's not around anyway.

00:09:34.940 --> 00:09:37.960
I mean, he's alive, but he stopped blogging many, many years ago.

00:09:38.280 --> 00:09:40.640
Yeah, he wrote an online book called Dive into Python.

00:09:41.220 --> 00:09:44.220
And we both read that and we're like, oh, what's this Python thing?

00:09:44.620 --> 00:09:51.600
And thanks to the kindness or possibly ignorance of our boss, we just started using Python one day.

00:09:52.120 --> 00:09:53.880
We didn't really have to get much buy-in or anything.

00:09:54.960 --> 00:10:00.520
And we'd started making little bits and pieces in Python, never really with the intent of making a framework.

00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:06.780
But over time, at some point, we just decided, okay, we're switching to Python.

00:10:06.900 --> 00:10:07.600
No more PHP.

00:10:07.820 --> 00:10:12.500
just going to do everything in this new thing. And I remember the key thing for us is how do

00:10:12.500 --> 00:10:51.260
you deploy Python? Well, there was modpython, the Apache module, and we were just a little bit nervous about it because not many other people were using it. And so we're thinking, okay, well, we can try modpython, but what if it doesn't work? So, okay, well, if we have an abstraction layer between our code and modpython, like a request and a response object, then if modpython doesn't work out, we can swap it out for something else. We didn't, modpython worked great, But that abstraction layer, I think that was the origins of Django, that tiny little layer between R code and mod python, just in case. Classic thing you shouldn't do in programming, right? You're not going to need it. You don't need the abstraction layer, but we built one anyway. And fast forward 20 years and maybe that was a good idea after all.

00:10:51.740 --> 00:10:54.300
Is mod python still around? It's got to be, right?

00:10:54.500 --> 00:10:58.320
I don't know. I mean, modwhiskey, it was replaced by modwhiskey many years ago.

00:10:59.240 --> 00:11:03.480
But yeah, I don't know actually. I've not checked in on the ModPython project in a while.

00:11:04.519 --> 00:11:08.100
It's been last commit eight months ago to ModPython on GitHub.

00:11:08.100 --> 00:11:08.700
Oh, very smart.

00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:09.140
Yeah, yeah.

00:11:09.860 --> 00:11:10.600
That sounds alive.

00:11:10.820 --> 00:11:12.020
Yeah, yeah, it's definitely alive.

00:11:12.340 --> 00:11:18.000
And now we have WSGI and ASGI and that's sort of carrying on the same theme in a way.

00:11:18.300 --> 00:11:37.940
You know, WSGI kind of came out of the work we were doing in that we were working on Django, at the Journal World. The mailing list popped up, the Python web-sig mailing list. This mailing list popped up. We were very active on that initially, trying to pitch our request and response objects.

00:11:38.140 --> 00:11:49.160
We did not win with our response request objects, and Whiskey came out of that instead. But yeah, that was definitely... Whiskey came out of that early era of what we were trying to achieve with with the stuff we were doing.

00:11:49.380 --> 00:11:55.700
So we built up this series of libraries slash tools slash, I guess it turned into a framework.

00:11:56.100 --> 00:11:59.120
And we started thinking, oh, this is kind of interesting.

00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:04.380
Personally, speaking for myself, I was like, oh, I'm probably not going to work here forever, but I would love to keep using this.

00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:07.160
So that sort of started planting the seed about open sourcing it.

00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:15.240
But I think very few people today know that even 20 years ago, there was this meme that there are way too many Python web frameworks.

00:12:15.980 --> 00:12:20.200
So we went to PyCon US and it had to have been 2004.

00:12:21.460 --> 00:12:29.000
And there was a keynote where the speaker said, she showed a slide that was like a tag cloud of all the Python web framework names.

00:12:29.490 --> 00:12:30.700
And there were like 50 of them.

00:12:31.140 --> 00:12:33.980
So Simon and I were sitting there like,

00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:36.260
oh shoot, we made yet another one.

00:12:36.280 --> 00:12:36.820
We're fools.

00:12:37.120 --> 00:12:37.740
We're so stupid.

00:12:38.020 --> 00:12:38.400
We're embarrassed.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:44.700
But I ended up doing a lightning talk at that PyCon and showed what we had.

00:12:44.860 --> 00:12:46.280
It didn't have a name yet.

00:12:46.500 --> 00:12:50.040
And, you know, people came up to me afterward and said, oh, please open source.

00:12:50.520 --> 00:12:51.520
We're very interested in this.

00:12:51.560 --> 00:12:55.260
It looks very promising open source, even though it's yet another Python web framework.

00:12:55.520 --> 00:13:01.360
So I guess extrapolating a lesson from that, it's never too late to make stuff.

00:13:01.640 --> 00:13:05.840
I think another fact there is that Ruby on Rails had come out maybe six months before that PyCon.

00:13:05.960 --> 00:13:10.920
Like Ruby on Rails was the absolute buzz of everything in the web development industry at the time.

00:13:11.500 --> 00:13:15.240
And there was an open question like, what's Python's answer to Ruby on Rails?

00:13:15.360 --> 00:13:19.320
And so it's possible that the Django timing was really good on that front.

00:13:19.580 --> 00:13:23.140
I believe that Rails helped influence the newspaper to open source Django.

00:13:23.300 --> 00:13:24.860
Was that part of the conversation then?

00:13:25.460 --> 00:13:34.800
Well, I remember making a list of 10 to 20 reasons why we should open source it and really thinking hard about it, probably lost some sleep about it.

00:13:35.120 --> 00:13:39.100
And we went into the meeting with Rob to make our pitch.

00:13:39.540 --> 00:13:42.060
And we only got to like five reasons.

00:13:42.270 --> 00:13:43.580
And finally he was like, yeah, let's do it.

00:13:44.020 --> 00:13:47.700
So, I mean, endless, infinite credit to him for being cool.

00:13:48.240 --> 00:13:52.180
And I mean, the company took advantage of open source a lot.

00:13:52.290 --> 00:14:01.860
And I think the higher ups knew it because it also owned a cable company that did a lot of stuff with Linux and all sorts of crazy cable company software that was open source.

00:14:02.400 --> 00:14:03.640
Which was made Frank, right?

00:14:03.790 --> 00:14:07.320
That was Frank Wiles at the cable company driving all of that stuff.

00:14:07.900 --> 00:14:24.480
Yeah, you know, I think it's worth pointing out as well. One, Adrian, you're making me nostalgic just to think about tag clouds. Okay. They were such a thing back in the early 2000s. It's a usability nightmare. I know. Any kind of data or information out of that thing.

00:14:24.580 --> 00:14:25.860
It really is.

00:14:25.980 --> 00:14:31.320
I think I use, oh my God, Delicious a lot, and you'll get tag clouds out of it and all sorts of stuff.

00:14:31.620 --> 00:14:33.160
But that's not why I'm bringing this up.

00:14:33.280 --> 00:14:39.680
More in that timeframe, open sourcing something was not the clear choice it is today.

00:14:39.920 --> 00:14:42.540
At least it was really more of a push, I think.

00:14:43.140 --> 00:14:45.360
Legal liabilities, giving away our IP.

00:14:45.650 --> 00:14:46.560
Like it was a different time.

00:14:46.700 --> 00:14:48.700
There was open source, but not like today.

00:14:50.760 --> 00:14:54.060
This portion of Talk Python To Me is brought to you by Centuries Seer.

00:14:54.500 --> 00:14:57.540
I'm excited to share a new tool from Sentry, Seer.

00:14:58.060 --> 00:15:05.400
Seer is your AI-driven pair programmer that finds, diagnoses, and fixes code issues in your Python app faster than ever.

00:15:05.900 --> 00:15:09.600
If you're already using Sentry, you are already using Sentry, right?

00:15:10.100 --> 00:15:14.380
Then using Seer is as simple as enabling a feature on your already existing project.

00:15:15.180 --> 00:15:18.520
Seer taps into all the rich context Sentry has about an error.

00:15:19.020 --> 00:15:23.080
Stack traces, logs, commit history, performance data, essentially everything.

00:15:23.680 --> 00:15:27.800
Then it employs its agentic AI code capabilities to figure out what is wrong.

00:15:28.420 --> 00:15:32.200
It's like having a senior developer pair programming with you on bug fixes.

00:15:32.960 --> 00:15:38.300
Sear then proposes a solution, generating a patch for your code and even opening a GitHub pull request.

00:15:38.860 --> 00:15:43.480
This leaves the developers in charge because it's up to them to actually approve the PR.

00:15:43.900 --> 00:15:47.620
But it can reduce the time from error detection to fix dramatically.

00:15:48.400 --> 00:15:53.960
Developers who've tried it found it can fix errors in one shot that would have taken them hours to debug.

00:15:54.660 --> 00:15:59.060
SEER boasts a 94.5% accuracy in identifying root causes.

00:15:59.640 --> 00:16:06.320
SEER also prioritizes actionable issues with an actionability score, so you know what to fix first.

00:16:06.940 --> 00:16:13.940
This transforms sentry errors into actionable fixes, turning a pile of error reports into an ordered to-do list.

00:16:14.600 --> 00:16:23.660
If you could use an always-on-call AI agent to help track down errors and propose fixes before you even have time to read the notification, check out Sentry's Seer.

00:16:24.300 --> 00:16:28.280
Just visit talkpython.fm/seer, S-E-E-R.

00:16:28.940 --> 00:16:30.780
The link is in your podcast player's show notes.

00:16:31.300 --> 00:16:33.600
Be sure to use our code, TALKPYTHON.

00:16:33.960 --> 00:16:34.860
One word, all caps.

00:16:35.540 --> 00:16:37.600
Thank you to Sentry for supporting Talk Pythonemy.

00:16:38.520 --> 00:16:44.900
Well, also, the publisher of the newspaper at the time still used a mechanical typewriter to write up his things.

00:16:45.100 --> 00:16:46.180
He was legendary for it.

00:16:47.140 --> 00:16:49.000
But my understanding is that he got into it.

00:16:49.880 --> 00:16:54.340
The argument that was convincing to the newspaper was, "We benefit from this community.

00:16:54.400 --> 00:16:58.780
We should give back to this community." That evidently was part of the pitch.

00:17:00.860 --> 00:17:02.160
It just took off.

00:17:03.360 --> 00:17:07.380
I feel like that newspaper did very well from that one decision that they made back then.

00:17:07.740 --> 00:17:27.459
Yeah, I mean, here we are this many years later talking about it on a podcast, right? Like already, a lot of people know about it. And a lot of people, all of you on the call, but many, many, many others have contributed back to Django to make so much better. If that was just an internal CMS that you guys left there, how many external contributors would you have? Right? Not that many.

00:17:27.660 --> 00:17:34.340
Well, one thing, actually, I'm curious while the two of you are here, I heard a story that there were some efforts to monetize it that didn't pan out.

00:17:34.800 --> 00:17:35.800
Jeff, maybe you were there for that.

00:17:36.080 --> 00:17:36.840
Is that true?

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:42.820
Were there some efforts to package it up and sell it to newspapers in some capacity as a premium product, I think?

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:43.760
Am I making that up?

00:17:44.620 --> 00:17:46.460
That was after my time, I think.

00:17:46.860 --> 00:17:47.580
Are you talking about?

00:17:47.820 --> 00:17:48.800
Maybe Frank mentioned that.

00:17:48.820 --> 00:17:50.480
I thought there was something around.

00:17:50.800 --> 00:17:51.780
Yeah, this was Ellington.

00:17:51.920 --> 00:17:52.720
I think we should.

00:17:52.720 --> 00:17:53.200
Oh, I guess.

00:17:53.320 --> 00:17:53.400
Yeah.

00:17:53.600 --> 00:17:53.680
Sorry.

00:17:53.860 --> 00:18:25.680
to Jeff who um yeah this is kind of my era I guess then was um and I still feel like I'm new to Django because I felt like and I've been around for 18 years but like I just I saw these guys code so much and then I came into that era so to me it felt like next gen Star Trek versus now the originals um and so yeah when I started we had hundreds of newspapers were buying Ellington which was basically like what was it the first or second Django app ever written and they basically created a CMS to run your newspaper and then they also had something called marketplace which was almost like an online Craigslist or business directory.

00:18:26.090 --> 00:18:31.780
And so I came in to kind of help manage some of the inventory and do a lot of data imports and stuff for newspapers.

00:18:32.050 --> 00:18:34.240
Like we had all of Massachusetts at one point.

00:18:35.060 --> 00:18:37.660
There was a lot of kind of that, they went that direction with it.

00:18:38.060 --> 00:18:43.400
And I left before that kind of had shuttered and I think they sold it to a big company to buy it.

00:18:43.410 --> 00:18:45.420
And I think Ellington still runs to this day.

00:18:46.340 --> 00:18:50.720
At DjangoCon every two or three years, somebody will approach and say, we want to open source Ellington.

00:18:50.910 --> 00:18:52.920
Would you like to, could we do this at DjangoCon?

00:18:53.040 --> 00:18:58.140
We always say, "Yeah, that'd be really cool." Then six years has gone by and it happens every so often.

00:18:58.620 --> 00:19:04.860
I hope that code gets to see the light of day because it was hundreds of apps by the time we worked on it for hundreds of newspapers.

00:19:05.300 --> 00:19:10.380
I feel like the product was fantastic and the market was great, but it's a terrible market to be selling into.

00:19:11.060 --> 00:19:18.380
In the late 2000s, early 2010s, if you're selling to local newspapers, which are blinking out of existence at a rate of knots.

00:19:21.820 --> 00:19:25.120
My hunch is that the marketplace challenges were down to that.

00:19:25.280 --> 00:19:28.720
It was selling into a shrinking industry, which is a difficult thing to do.

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:31.120
Yeah, I think they were hitting a brick wall for sure.

00:19:31.840 --> 00:19:33.740
You mentioned Rails earlier and PHP.

00:19:34.340 --> 00:19:35.540
And two things come to mind.

00:19:35.900 --> 00:19:39.900
I have an embarrassing email I sent to Simon at one point because I followed your PHP blog.

00:19:40.240 --> 00:19:43.360
And also Matt Croydon, who later became my boss at Media for Media.

00:19:43.700 --> 00:19:44.400
And I did not.

00:19:44.420 --> 00:19:45.420
I saw a couple of things.

00:19:45.620 --> 00:19:48.440
I think you were so into Django, you weren't really posting about Django.

00:19:48.860 --> 00:19:51.880
And so I think I emailed you once to say, have you seen this thing called Django?

00:19:52.350 --> 00:19:53.260
It looks pretty cool.

00:19:53.450 --> 00:19:55.400
Now that you're doing Python, I think you may like it.

00:19:55.610 --> 00:19:58.780
And so if you ever check your Gmail, it may be there.

00:19:58.890 --> 00:20:00.360
We don't have to do anything live on the air.

00:20:00.560 --> 00:20:04.080
But yeah, I to this day think, oh man, that was kind of wild.

00:20:04.820 --> 00:20:10.040
What brought me to Django though was I did get the Rails book because they very quickly created a Ruby on Rails book.

00:20:10.050 --> 00:20:14.540
It was kind of the main way to learn how to use it because their website kind of sucked as far as documentation went.

00:20:14.880 --> 00:20:19.720
And as I was going through it, so much was boilerplate just to get anything running in Rails.

00:20:20.070 --> 00:20:28.060
And so the Django admin was just so beautifully designed and well done that to me, it was just this win of like, this looks better than anything I could do by hand.

00:20:28.250 --> 00:20:30.620
And it's largely stood the test of time for 20 years.

00:20:31.380 --> 00:20:35.980
I remember like Wilson Miner I had met a couple of times had done some of that work or most of that work.

00:20:36.170 --> 00:20:40.200
He did all of that design work and he designed the original Django website.

00:20:40.540 --> 00:20:50.400
And I think that's one of the main reasons that we got a lot of traction was because the design of the site and the documentation were so good, especially considering the context.

00:20:50.480 --> 00:21:01.780
I mean, that back in those times, it was par for the course for an open source project to have to be completely on style, like a normal, like browser default H1 Craigslist background.

00:21:02.280 --> 00:21:04.320
This design isn't the one that Wilson did.

00:21:04.560 --> 00:21:07.580
The one that's archived that or get to go back.

00:21:07.900 --> 00:21:09.700
But it was pretty timeless at the time, though.

00:21:09.700 --> 00:21:10.180
It was amazing.

00:21:10.640 --> 00:21:15.080
And I feel like the admin has evolved a lot, but it still has that sort of...

00:21:15.080 --> 00:21:18.280
It feels like the Wilson minor design today, even 20 years later.

00:21:19.660 --> 00:21:24.980
Wilson was there the same time I was at the Journal World, and he then went on to early Facebook.

00:21:25.200 --> 00:21:27.160
He was, he's bounced around Silicon Valley.

00:21:27.900 --> 00:21:28.020
Yeah.

00:21:28.180 --> 00:21:29.920
Redesigned Apple.com, I think too.

00:21:30.260 --> 00:21:32.820
He worked with me at EveryBlock for a few years.

00:21:33.480 --> 00:21:34.740
He's now working on Apple Music.

00:21:35.060 --> 00:21:35.880
I didn't know that.

00:21:35.880 --> 00:21:36.240
Excellent.

00:21:37.100 --> 00:21:40.520
As of last time we talked to him, which was recent-ish.

00:21:40.940 --> 00:21:41.500
Yeah, that's quite neat.

00:21:41.920 --> 00:21:43.160
Trying to pull it up here in the Wayback Machine.

00:21:43.360 --> 00:21:44.700
We'll see what I can get.

00:21:44.730 --> 00:21:45.860
I think the other thing I...

00:21:46.020 --> 00:21:46.600
How about this, guys?

00:21:46.740 --> 00:21:47.280
Is this the OG?

00:21:47.460 --> 00:21:47.800
There we go.

00:21:48.240 --> 00:21:48.500
Yep, yep.

00:21:50.220 --> 00:21:50.820
That's the one.

00:21:51.120 --> 00:21:53.860
And that, to be fair, that looks good by today's standard.

00:21:54.340 --> 00:21:59.980
You know, I feel like I would not be at all upset to publish a website look like that in 2025.

00:22:00.740 --> 00:22:01.560
Yeah, that is pretty timeless.

00:22:01.860 --> 00:22:02.100
That's cool.

00:22:02.400 --> 00:22:03.380
Wait, I see the...

00:22:03.650 --> 00:22:04.160
Oh, go ahead, Simon.

00:22:04.500 --> 00:22:23.220
Oh, it's good. The other thing that's worth mentioning with Django, Django's documentation has always been fantastic. And I think that's basically because it was Jacob Kaplan Moss had a, he was a literature major and you have Adrian, who's a journalism major. And it turns out if you put a journalist and somebody who like put that talent on your documentation, you get really

00:22:23.320 --> 00:22:34.980
good documentation. There was, that was a double-edged sword because it took a few years for any publisher to be interested in publishing a book about Django because the standard line was always, oh, the docs are good enough.

00:22:35.220 --> 00:22:36.860
Everyone just, there's no market for it.

00:22:38.400 --> 00:22:47.240
Well, but at the same time, I wanted to ask, I mean, because there was the link there to the Django book, which I have the URL now and Jeff and I run, it lists all the Django books.

00:22:47.460 --> 00:22:49.260
But I mean, the two of you wrote that.

00:22:49.340 --> 00:22:50.640
I thought that was a great book.

00:22:50.740 --> 00:22:52.360
I think you, it was in print, right?

00:22:52.440 --> 00:22:53.660
But it was mainly open source, Adrian?

00:22:54.020 --> 00:22:54.920
Yeah, it was both.

00:22:55.040 --> 00:22:58.040
It was free online and it was published by A-Press.

00:22:58.480 --> 00:22:59.900
There were a couple of editions, yeah.

00:23:00.240 --> 00:23:07.240
The interesting question for Paul Everett out there in the audience is, In the first years, did your team also have to admin the newspaper site?

00:23:07.330 --> 00:23:09.660
Like, did you DevOps before DevOps was a thing?

00:23:10.300 --> 00:23:11.160
Or how did you run it?

00:23:11.350 --> 00:23:12.980
The cloud stuff wasn't that big back then.

00:23:13.240 --> 00:23:14.640
No, we had our own physical servers.

00:23:15.240 --> 00:23:15.880
In the basement.

00:23:16.330 --> 00:23:17.000
In the basement.

00:23:17.720 --> 00:23:18.660
The team was in the basement.

00:23:18.680 --> 00:23:19.660
You could probably hear them.

00:23:19.750 --> 00:23:20.260
Your programmers.

00:23:20.780 --> 00:23:23.860
And yeah, there was a room in the basement with physical servers.

00:23:24.370 --> 00:23:25.780
And oh, I've forgotten their names now.

00:23:25.890 --> 00:23:27.440
I think Frank helped.

00:23:27.560 --> 00:23:29.880
Well, they were named after characters in Beatles songs.

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:30.960
One was Mr. Mustard.

00:23:31.090 --> 00:23:32.840
One was Pam from Polytheon Pam.

00:23:33.260 --> 00:23:46.420
Yes. Yep. But yeah, and Frank and Nick from Sunflat Cable helped us wire those up. But yeah, it was a fit. There was an Apple server in there as well. That was the media server,

00:23:46.830 --> 00:23:54.600
I think. It was doing like imagery sizing. Yeah, it was like a 2U box or something. I forget. It was actually like a physical server that now, because I'd never seen one before in person.

00:23:55.040 --> 00:24:07.460
XServe. It was an XServe. Yeah. Also, I remember that room had a wire that was the AP News wire, Like I didn't realize there was a physical wire that the news came in on from the Associated Press.

00:24:07.910 --> 00:24:10.540
And when you hear it came in over the wire, that was the wire?

00:24:10.780 --> 00:24:11.420
That was the wire.

00:24:11.520 --> 00:24:13.440
We had the actual wire in our basement.

00:24:13.700 --> 00:24:13.760
Yeah.

00:24:14.640 --> 00:24:14.980
Incredible.

00:24:15.520 --> 00:24:29.280
Well, Simon and I were lucky because we didn't really have any sysadmin experience, but there were some really experienced guys, Frank and Nick, who worked at the company and actually did some training with us.

00:24:29.680 --> 00:24:31.680
I remember going into their dark room.

00:24:32.500 --> 00:24:33.800
All the lights were like turned off.

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:35.820
You could only see like these Unix shells.

00:24:36.080 --> 00:24:38.200
I was like, whoa, I'm really learning the good stuff.

00:24:38.720 --> 00:24:39.880
And this is the same Frank.

00:24:40.020 --> 00:24:43.940
This is Frank Wiles, who he's been president of the Django Software Foundation in the past.

00:24:43.980 --> 00:24:46.660
And he's still very heavily involved with Django to this day.

00:24:46.960 --> 00:24:47.120
Yeah.

00:24:47.440 --> 00:24:47.600
All right.

00:24:47.680 --> 00:24:48.760
Let's talk about 2008.

00:24:48.760 --> 00:24:50.420
A lot of stuff happened around 2008.

00:24:50.940 --> 00:24:54.800
That was the timeframe a little bit before then Django's open source.

00:24:55.280 --> 00:25:00.000
But maybe you'll have to tell me, maybe a little bit inspired by Ruby on Rails.

00:25:00.480 --> 00:25:05.640
There's a lot of, in Ruby on Rails, a lot of convention over configuration, a lot of magic.

00:25:05.980 --> 00:25:09.160
And Django used to have a little more implicit magic.

00:25:09.280 --> 00:25:14.100
And there was the, when Django went to, around when it went to 1.0, there was the magic removal.

00:25:14.380 --> 00:25:16.800
And it was the first DjangoCon, all those things.

00:25:17.200 --> 00:25:18.740
Tell us about that, whoever wants to take it.

00:25:18.940 --> 00:25:21.640
I can talk to DjangoCon a little bit, the very first DjangoCon.

00:25:22.539 --> 00:25:29.600
I was working for a radio station in London that was doing a big Django project.

00:25:30.220 --> 00:25:35.680
One of my co-workers there was this chap, Rob Lofthouse, who very foolishly stepped up and said, "Well, okay.

00:25:36.200 --> 00:25:38.460
Everyone says there should be a conference and no one's arranging a conference.

00:25:38.620 --> 00:25:39.500
I'll arrange a conference.

00:25:39.660 --> 00:25:43.940
How hard can it be?" The answer is everyone in the school understands it's very, very, very hard.

00:25:44.320 --> 00:25:45.160
He managed to pull it off.

00:25:46.100 --> 00:25:48.640
The big thing there was that Google offered to host it.

00:25:49.260 --> 00:25:53.140
We got the venue and the catering and everything was in Google's campus in Mountain View.

00:25:53.540 --> 00:25:55.900
Was 2008, was that the year of the first DjangoCon?

00:25:56.170 --> 00:25:57.080
I think it was, right?

00:25:57.320 --> 00:25:57.720
I think it was.

00:25:58.480 --> 00:26:01.580
And yeah, we pulled together a conference.

00:26:03.620 --> 00:26:06.400
The videos from that conference were all available on YouTube, actually.

00:26:06.470 --> 00:26:10.500
I rewatched one of the panels quite recently, just out of interest.

00:26:11.040 --> 00:26:30.740
It was really fascinating seeing there are people on those panels, like Russell Keith mcgee was on the database migrations panel and he was just like one of the people who was trying to solve database migrations back then and of course he's been an enormous fixture in the python and django community ever since um but yeah that was that was really fun that was uh like how many of

00:26:30.740 --> 00:26:46.900
us were that jeff were you at the first django conference i was i was barely working at the journal world like maybe six months or a year or something so yeah i just just kind of experienced at all as a nobody. So it was great. And I think my biggest contribution to that conference was,

00:26:47.380 --> 00:27:13.440
so I was working on a migration system called demigrations and Andrew Godwin was working on, I think he was calling it South back then. the, like his migration and we had Russell Keith and I got, I managed to, I made the pitch for Andrew, who was just a student at university at time to be flown to California to present at this conference. I think it may have been his first ever conference talk. And he has been to and spoken at every Django and Python conference since.

00:27:13.760 --> 00:27:19.000
So I like to think I helped just provide that little spark to get his speaking career started.

00:27:20.180 --> 00:27:24.440
But yeah, it was a very, very notable moment, that first DjangoCon.

00:27:24.680 --> 00:28:00.920
I had a mind-blowing moment there. A guy from, I think it was Japan, came up to me. He didn't speak a word of English and he gave me his book that he had written about Django whoa and and he just like bowed and and went away and that's I still think about that and it still kind of brings a tear to me it's like what it's it's mind-blowing that people all around the world that you've never met who speak languages you don't speak use your code like it I still it's been 20 years I still can't even like 100% come to terms with it it's really cool yeah I thought

00:28:00.980 --> 00:28:10.000
you're gonna go a different direction and you're gonna say when Cal Henderson put that sign up of the unicorn like that was going to forever be the moment but i don't know if you want to expand well

00:28:10.200 --> 00:28:33.780
that's the downside of that first jango con there was a q a with me and jacob and i think it was me i said are there any pony requests and that was intended to mean are there any feature ideas sort of open suggestions and evidently that was the um the impetus for the idea of the jango pony which I despise.

00:28:34.190 --> 00:28:38.540
I think it's so dumb and I think that's directly related to me retiring from the project, frankly.

00:28:38.860 --> 00:28:39.280
Oh no!

00:28:39.620 --> 00:28:43.480
I know it's funny in a way but it's also infuriating to me.

00:28:43.480 --> 00:28:48.140
I think it's so stupid and unprofessional and the type of humor is just dumb.

00:28:48.560 --> 00:28:49.520
No wit at all.

00:28:49.700 --> 00:28:50.640
I'll stop my rant.

00:28:50.860 --> 00:28:51.560
That'll be on my own.

00:28:51.680 --> 00:28:55.500
Whenever I start my own podcast I'm going to have the first episode on why the Django pony sucks.

00:28:56.260 --> 00:28:57.260
Wait, what should it be though?

00:28:57.530 --> 00:28:58.440
What would you like it to be?

00:28:58.610 --> 00:28:59.280
Do you have thoughts?

00:28:59.620 --> 00:29:00.840
I think you underestimated.

00:29:02.240 --> 00:29:06.180
I would have guessed it would have went like a it should at least be playing a guitar people love

00:29:07.740 --> 00:29:09.920
celebrating this for that event and occasion

00:29:10.780 --> 00:29:15.140
qualified people Timo I have one of your stickers on my fridge

00:29:15.320 --> 00:29:17.500
that's one of the things I did for the 20th birthday

00:29:17.700 --> 00:29:19.100
I designed a new pony

00:29:20.060 --> 00:29:27.300
to distribute to people around the world you might have seen one at the Amsterdam event people really like the mascots

00:29:27.780 --> 00:29:31.000
a bag of the stickers was passed to me and I passed it along.

00:29:31.570 --> 00:29:33.220
To the trash can. No, just kidding.

00:29:35.180 --> 00:29:39.220
This portion of Talk Python To Me is brought to you by Sentry's AI agent monitoring.

00:29:39.990 --> 00:29:43.200
Are you building AI capabilities into your Python applications?

00:29:43.950 --> 00:29:52.060
Whether you're using open AI, local LLMs, or something else, visibility into your AI agent's behavior, performance, and cost is critical.

00:29:52.860 --> 00:29:57.280
You will definitely want to give Sentry's brand new AI agent monitoring a look.

00:29:58.140 --> 00:30:07.740
AI agent monitoring gives you transparent observability into every step of your AI features so you can debug, optimize, and control the cost with confidence.

00:30:08.540 --> 00:30:11.900
You'll get full observability into every step of your AI agents.

00:30:12.040 --> 00:30:16.900
That is model calls, prompts, external tool usage, and custom logic steps.

00:30:17.740 --> 00:30:24.240
AI agent monitoring captures every step of an AI agent's workflow from the user's input to the final response.

00:30:24.940 --> 00:30:31.480
And your app will have a dedicated AI agent's dashboard showing traces and timelines for each agent run.

00:30:32.080 --> 00:30:40.560
You'll get alerts on model errors, latency spikes, token usage surges, and API failures protecting both performance and cost.

00:30:41.020 --> 00:30:43.480
It's plug-and-play Python SDK integration.

00:30:43.980 --> 00:30:49.800
Open AI for now for Django, Flask, and FastAPI apps with more AI platforms coming soon.

00:30:50.400 --> 00:30:58.960
In summary, AI agent monitoring turns the often black box behavior of AI in your app into transparent, debuggable processes.

00:30:59.700 --> 00:31:04.680
If you're adding AI capabilities to your Python app, give Sentry's AI agent monitoring the look.

00:31:05.200 --> 00:31:13.680
Just visit talkpython.fm/sentryagents to get started and be sure to use our code TALKPYTHON, one word, all caps.

00:31:14.120 --> 00:31:16.060
The link is in your podcast player's show notes.

00:31:16.520 --> 00:31:19.100
Thank you to Sentry for supporting Talk Python and me.

00:31:20.720 --> 00:32:00.040
another notable thing that happened in 2008 other than the housing crisis crash that wrecked a bunch of things was the foundation right the jingo software foundation and i think more broadly i think one of the things that makes you know i talked to a lot of different people about different web frameworks and the thing that really makes jingo stick and stand out i think is one the admin thing but the other is the community around jingo and we're talking about the jingo conference the foundation it's just unlike other things there's there's a whole community that you get into when you go into django not just some apis you use you know what i mean so uh who wants to take the

00:32:00.570 --> 00:32:35.000
tell us about how the foundation got started so that was i was there uh so the there was the question of who owns the code um it was i think technically owned by the lawrence journal world correct me if I'm wrong. And so that wasn't going to last forever. So we needed to find for legal, you know, ownership reasons, an entity to own it. We didn't want to go the route of Ruby on Rails, copyright David Hennemeyer Hanson. I think that's just really cringe. So it's good to have an organization as part of it. So yeah, we set up 501c3 if that's the right one that we use. I forget.

00:32:36.080 --> 00:32:41.160
And yeah, that's basically the origin story. From my perspective, I'm sure there's a lot more

00:32:41.180 --> 00:32:46.780
subtlety to it oh gosh do you want to weigh in yeah i was only barely started that time so

00:32:47.050 --> 00:33:16.340
like i definitely relate to you know the community around django you were all telling why you got involved and when and how and for me it was it was whacked as a day job but then what got me to stick around is actually django girls and organizing some of those local workshops and you know having organizations like this like alongside the django project not even the main thing is definitely only possible because we've had such a like long running open source foundation. There's lots of aspects of the foundation we could discuss, but definitely, you know, that kind of longevity

00:33:16.940 --> 00:33:33.160
for community run open source is rare and to be cherished. Yeah. Maybe you could tell us a little bit like what was it when it started and what is it now? Like how has it changed over the time, over the years? I'm going to put in a plug for the Django Fellows program. I feel like the Django

00:33:33.200 --> 00:33:38.520
Fellows program has been an absolutely astonishingly effective part of the mission of the foundation.

00:33:38.820 --> 00:34:05.900
For people who aren't familiar with that, the Django Software Foundation employs fellows who are paid contributors who work on the bits of open source maintenance that aren't necessarily so glamorous. They do bug issue, they do code review and handle security incidents and bug triage and all of these different things. And thanks to them, Django has a release schedule that operates like clockwork. Like Django, there's a new release that comes out when they said it was going to come out.

00:34:06.060 --> 00:34:45.040
Code gets reviewed, bugs get trashed. It's a wonderful, wonderful thing. It's unique because most open source projects that are run like that have a company behind them. There are people who have a full-time job and there's a company that's commercially supporting that. Django does not have a commercial sponsor in that respect. It has this nonprofit that people fund and that employs these these fellows and the fellows keep everything ticking long. I keep on saying to other open source projects, if you can figure out a pattern to use that's similar to the Django fellows, that's absolutely worth doing. The Python Software Foundation has a developer in residence program now, or several developers in residence, which were inspired by the Django fellows program.

00:34:45.320 --> 00:34:59.380
I think it's been really influential. And it's notable because there are very few major open source projects that don't have a company behind them. The other one that comes up a lot is Postgres, Postgres is very much a community-organized program.

00:34:59.800 --> 00:35:03.800
If you look at the way Postgres works, a lot of the key maintainers have their own consultancies.

00:35:04.180 --> 00:35:08.700
So they've got a good way of financially sustaining the work that they're doing.

00:35:09.240 --> 00:35:12.640
I think the Django Fellows Program, which was introduced...

00:35:13.140 --> 00:35:13.760
When was that?

00:35:13.820 --> 00:35:16.500
That was at least 10 years ago the Fellows Program started.

00:35:16.500 --> 00:35:17.960
I think it's been an enormous success.

00:35:18.520 --> 00:35:18.880
Yeah, absolutely.

00:35:19.320 --> 00:35:27.200
Another thing that I think is really interesting, it's a little bit newer, but is the Django Knots program, right?

00:35:27.620 --> 00:35:29.980
And Django Girls as well, shout out to them.

00:35:30.500 --> 00:35:37.160
You know, so many people I've talked to are like, I got into Python because I wanted to do Django, which for you all is probably a little bit mind-blowing as well.

00:35:37.320 --> 00:35:39.300
Like, they didn't use Django because they were Python,

00:35:39.540 --> 00:35:40.300
but the other way around.

00:35:40.360 --> 00:35:43.380
The first time I met somebody who said, oh yeah, I got into Python because of Django.

00:35:43.700 --> 00:35:45.080
And I was absolutely bowled away.

00:35:45.260 --> 00:35:50.320
I always assumed you'd have to be a proficient Python programmer before you could start picking up something like Django.

00:35:50.380 --> 00:35:51.360
It turns out it was the other way around.

00:35:51.580 --> 00:35:56.240
People would get in from, Because partly because the Django documentation was so good.

00:35:56.550 --> 00:36:02.540
But yeah, that's so many people got their start in the Python community as web developers who dabbled with Django and then got into Python from there.

00:36:02.720 --> 00:36:02.940
Yeah.

00:36:03.200 --> 00:36:05.640
Kenneth, love it on the audience because I learned Python through Django.

00:36:06.020 --> 00:36:06.480
Very cool.

00:36:06.720 --> 00:36:09.640
When I chaired DjangoCon US, I'd always ask the audience.

00:36:09.960 --> 00:36:11.080
For one, like I was always a nervous speaker.

00:36:11.370 --> 00:36:14.480
And so anytime you ask the audience to do something, it like takes my nerves away.

00:36:14.900 --> 00:36:17.820
But I'd always ask who learned Python by learning Django.

00:36:18.110 --> 00:36:20.320
And over half the room every year would always raise their hands up.

00:36:20.480 --> 00:36:22.920
So it was a heck of a gateway to learn Python.

00:36:23.040 --> 00:36:44.000
on. Also, we just hired our third fellow Jacob Walls last week, who I think starts this next Monday. So Django's up to three fellows now. And it's just been, the load is just incredible. So trying to keep up. I think our existing fellows have over a thousand tickets that they're trying to sort through. And if people are watching and want to help fund, contact Tebow and I,

00:36:44.010 --> 00:36:47.440
and we will definitely help you in the USF to support more fellows.

00:36:47.880 --> 00:36:51.380
We'll give you our annual reports, which details everything the foundation does,

00:36:51.680 --> 00:36:52.500
And more on the other side.

00:36:53.880 --> 00:37:04.740
Well, I just want to make one point on that because, I mean, T-Bone and Jeff, you know now, but the finances for a long time, like when I was treasurer in 2020 for three years, the total budget was under $200,000.

00:37:04.940 --> 00:37:06.540
And that was almost all fellows.

00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:11.180
So like the total budget for everything, including grants, legal stuff, hosting.

00:37:11.680 --> 00:37:17.140
I think now maybe it's $250,000, $300,000, but it's, you know, to your point, Simon, it's not funded by a corporation.

00:37:17.620 --> 00:37:18.320
It's tiny.

00:37:19.100 --> 00:37:22.600
And people don't realize that aside from the fellows, everything else is volunteers, right?

00:37:22.760 --> 00:37:23.420
Even the conferences.

00:37:23.760 --> 00:37:28.380
It's not, you know, PyCon, US, EuroPython have a lot of volunteers, but they also have paid employees.

00:37:28.620 --> 00:37:30.800
Like Django Cons are all volunteers.

00:37:31.260 --> 00:37:32.200
Yeah, they're all volunteer based.

00:37:32.460 --> 00:37:35.560
The PSF runs a staff of about, I used to be on the PSF board.

00:37:35.680 --> 00:37:36.320
Simon's on the board.

00:37:36.560 --> 00:37:36.980
I'm on the board.

00:37:37.440 --> 00:37:37.580
Yeah.

00:37:38.120 --> 00:37:43.120
Last time I saw, they probably have about, what, 2 million in salaries a year because of so many people.

00:37:43.480 --> 00:37:49.880
You've got like five or six developer in residence, at least probably what, like 12 to 13 people, maybe 14 people on staff.

00:37:50.140 --> 00:37:50.680
That's about right.

00:37:50.820 --> 00:37:50.940
Yeah.

00:37:52.160 --> 00:38:05.700
It's interesting how much the PSF is an accounting organization because it turns out accounting, especially if you're a nonprofit with like with a whole bunch of organizations who use the PSF as their fiscal sponsor to help them with their nonprofit accounting.

00:38:06.020 --> 00:38:11.300
There's a lot of there's a lot of accounting and logistical works that goes into an organization like the PSF.

00:38:11.520 --> 00:38:16.880
And PyCon US is run by the PSF as well, which is a 2,500 person conference these days.

00:38:17.100 --> 00:38:18.580
That gets very complicated.

00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:22.820
Yeah, so the DSF runs on shoestring size budget compared to the PSF.

00:38:23.120 --> 00:38:25.600
But Django is a pretty good amount of the community, though.

00:38:25.710 --> 00:38:28.780
So that's kind of one of the things we're doing is by getting that third fellow.

00:38:29.700 --> 00:38:36.540
And part of it, too, is we've ran, not to nerd out on expenses for a while, but the DSF for a long time has ran with over $200,000 in the bank.

00:38:36.750 --> 00:38:38.720
And to me, that's just not doing much with our money.

00:38:38.980 --> 00:38:41.600
So I know that we're also doing investments and stuff as well.

00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:46.520
But I think getting that third fellow was something that was just long overdue for the number of people that we have.

00:38:46.760 --> 00:38:54.880
If one fellow goes on vacation for a while and leave, it's just too much for one person to keep the foundation, keep security releases, releases going.

00:38:55.200 --> 00:38:58.360
So it was kind of long overdue, but I'm happy we're able to pull it off this year.

00:38:58.680 --> 00:38:59.260
Yeah, that's great.

00:38:59.660 --> 00:39:06.060
My favorite talk at JaggerCon last year was Jacob Kaplan Mosk gave a keynote about what the DSF would do with a million dollars.

00:39:06.420 --> 00:39:09.940
Like if the DSF could go up to a million dollars a year, what would they spend that money on?

00:39:10.140 --> 00:39:13.320
As also a pitch for why you should be sponsoring the DSF.

00:39:13.600 --> 00:39:18.900
I recommend people watch that if you want to get a feel for how that organization was shaped at least sort of 10 months ago.

00:39:19.240 --> 00:39:30.500
I think there's a huge impact that just having one or two people whose full-time job is to go into the corner, the dark corners of some open source project that's just not that interesting.

00:39:30.720 --> 00:39:39.040
Nobody really wants to go mess with, but just start hacking away on those and, you know, really putting the polish on stuff that is not as exciting as other pieces.

00:39:39.200 --> 00:39:55.420
And so there's not, you know, you said it's not that big relative to the PSF, but put the PSF aside, any other open source Python project, it's a really huge pool that you're working with relative to how many other projects even have fellows.

00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:56.700
Not many, if any.

00:39:57.140 --> 00:39:57.200
Yeah.

00:39:57.480 --> 00:39:58.080
Super, super cool.

00:39:58.540 --> 00:40:02.040
So let's talk about some of the more recent things.

00:40:02.370 --> 00:40:11.080
I know that at least personally, when the Instagram keynote came out a couple of years ago at PyCon, or maybe more than a couple, it was 2017, I think.

00:40:11.420 --> 00:40:19.400
But around that timeframe, just realizing how big some of the deployments of Django were, how much traffic people were serving through them.

00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:23.120
When it first came out, you probably didn't think on that scale.

00:40:23.980 --> 00:40:26.120
No, Instagram, Pinterest, NASA.

00:40:26.860 --> 00:40:40.080
Yeah, no, that was... The goal was to build newspaper websites, right? We wanted to be able to build... I loved Django's original tagline was "Web development on journalism deadlines". That's always been my favorite description of the project.

00:40:41.060 --> 00:40:45.340
Nice. Who else wants to chime in on this idea? Like this is just... It blew my mind. I'm like, wow.

00:40:45.440 --> 00:40:59.000
One thing I will say is a thread, Instagram's Twitter clone came out what last year or the year before. That's a Django app. I met one of the engineers of mine. It's just a classic Django app that Facebook launched just a few years ago.

00:40:59.260 --> 00:41:04.320
I believe technically they have their own fork. They didn't just download Django 4.0.

00:41:04.920 --> 00:41:08.700
I feel like at that scale, if you haven't got your own fork, I'd be very surprised.

00:41:08.770 --> 00:41:13.420
But yeah. For me, it runs on center. Sorry. I think I'm a brief

00:41:13.540 --> 00:41:14.500
I mean, one interesting thing.

00:41:14.600 --> 00:41:16.000
500 milliseconds behind all of you.

00:41:16.600 --> 00:41:19.960
For me, as far as scale, there's also the number of projects out there.

00:41:20.300 --> 00:41:23.540
I've been doing the counting to figure out our impacts.

00:41:23.800 --> 00:41:30.240
And I think we're at around the 500,000 live Django sites and apps out there from the numbers I could find.

00:41:30.520 --> 00:41:33.980
And also specific types of outreach.

00:41:34.220 --> 00:41:41.260
So governments, for example, seeing how many central governments of all the countries around the world basically use it.

00:41:41.460 --> 00:41:43.260
And when I say use it, it's not just like the one project.

00:41:43.540 --> 00:41:46.960
They have teams whose role is just to manage 10, 20, 50.

00:41:47.400 --> 00:41:54.480
I think right now, Brazil, of all countries, I don't have a connection there, had like 84 sites I could detect in a single environment using Django.

00:41:54.740 --> 00:41:56.800
Just imagine that times all the countries.

00:41:57.260 --> 00:41:57.480
Wow.

00:41:58.020 --> 00:42:02.620
You know, one of the things that's always fun for me to do is to go to the GitHub repo, right?

00:42:02.880 --> 00:42:07.080
And I've got Django with 85,000 stars and 32,000 forks.

00:42:07.380 --> 00:42:08.300
That's a really interesting number.

00:42:08.380 --> 00:42:12.700
That's way more forks to stars than an average project, by the way.

00:42:13.040 --> 00:42:23.280
But if you go down the side here, you can see they now track how many contributors and used by 1.997 million projects.

00:42:23.840 --> 00:42:24.560
That is a lot.

00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:26.060
Now, that's just on GitHub, right?

00:42:26.140 --> 00:42:29.280
That are public repositories that we can know about and stuff.

00:42:29.560 --> 00:42:33.140
And used by could be a student project, not a government entity.

00:42:33.720 --> 00:42:34.960
But still, that's pretty wild.

00:42:35.260 --> 00:42:35.740
Very impressive.

00:42:35.820 --> 00:42:38.680
Let's talk about some of the more recent transitions.

00:42:39.060 --> 00:42:43.800
I mean, I feel like the speed of major version releases is picking up.

00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:47.220
You know, we had the first three years, 2005 to 2008 for one.

00:42:47.440 --> 00:42:51.280
Then it was like one for a while, and then two, and then three, then four, then five.

00:42:51.800 --> 00:42:52.880
You guys are maybe working on six.

00:42:52.920 --> 00:42:53.280
I don't know.

00:42:53.880 --> 00:42:57.880
And also adopting some of the lot of changes coming in Python, right?

00:42:57.980 --> 00:43:00.220
Like async and await and that kind of stuff.

00:43:00.840 --> 00:43:01.240
How has that been?

00:43:01.240 --> 00:43:01.580
How did it start?

00:43:01.740 --> 00:43:06.280
In some ways, it's really tricky because people really love Django as it is.

00:43:06.760 --> 00:43:14.680
And from that standpoint, you have to make sure that such a big group of people agree on what exactly the future of Python means.

00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:17.660
So, you know, definitely mentioned AsyncAway. It's one of the big ones.

00:43:18.140 --> 00:43:20.560
API, is it in Django Core? Is it not?

00:43:21.130 --> 00:43:22.720
Mobile web, how much we get involved with that?

00:43:23.040 --> 00:43:27.580
These days, it's like the HTMLX that people really want to see Django support well.

00:43:27.860 --> 00:43:31.060
And I guess also AI to some extent. I don't know if we want to get there.

00:43:31.140 --> 00:43:41.560
But I guess for us, I think it's also, if it's not in core, we definitely have so many packages out there that we just try and curate a bit more these days, make sure they work well together.

00:43:42.020 --> 00:43:43.020
So that also helps a lot.

00:43:43.240 --> 00:43:43.340
Yeah.

00:43:43.600 --> 00:43:45.840
I think the package curation is really important.

00:43:46.320 --> 00:43:54.860
I would actually like to see Python in the standard library smaller and then recommend more stuff to keep the flexibility open so they could move faster, focus more.

00:43:55.200 --> 00:44:05.120
So what I find tricky about this one, Django has always been a batteries-included framework, And that's because in 2004, 2005, PyPI and PIPA didn't really exist.

00:44:05.440 --> 00:44:12.060
So if you weren't batteries included, then people had to, it was very high friction for people to glue together the pieces that they needed.

00:44:12.500 --> 00:44:16.200
And of course, today, I feel like Python packaging is incredibly good shape.

00:44:16.400 --> 00:44:20.720
Like you could ship a web framework today that was entirely dependent on other things.

00:44:21.020 --> 00:45:21.920
So then the value from the Django thing comes down more to everything being, that there's a Django promise that the stuff in Django core will continue to work. You're not going to have a situation where Python 3.15 comes out and Django templates stop working, but the ORM still works because everything is maintained in the one place by that single team. And I love that. I love that you just know that all of the pieces of Django are going to continue to work together. And the moment you add external packages, there's that little bit of risk. What if that external package that you're using becomes unmaintained in the future? So I'd quite like to see just a little of a sort of adoption of crucial packages under the Django software foundation, but not as part of Django itself. I want separate packages that maintain that promise to be maintained. Because we have fellows, which means that we can actually do that kind of work. But it's also a very big commitment to take on. It's an interesting pattern that I'd like to see explored a little bit more,

00:45:21.920 --> 00:45:26.380
I think. Yeah, it's easy to forget that it wasn't always there. Sorry, Will, go ahead.

00:45:26.540 --> 00:45:52.500
I was just going to ask Adrian and Simon. I mean, even today, batteries included web frameworks are not that common. It's still the trend, more micro frameworks. I'm curious what your take is on that. I mean, like FastAPI, right? That's a lightweight framework. It seems, I'm always shocked there aren't more batteries included frameworks in PICA language. Maybe it's too difficult to do, but micro frameworks seem more common. There's sort of only one batteries included option for programming language.

00:45:52.900 --> 00:45:59.580
I feel like the sales pitch, like you get to pick the best pieces for the components for your project, always sounds great.

00:46:00.260 --> 00:46:03.740
Obviously, you don't want one thing that dictates what you're going to use for all of the different things.

00:46:03.900 --> 00:46:06.300
You'd much rather pick and choose the things that are most valuable.

00:46:06.740 --> 00:46:14.500
But the trade-off that people don't talk about much is the fact that now every single one of those selections is getting you further away from that sort of community standards.

00:46:14.820 --> 00:46:17.560
There's more risk of future maintenance problems.

00:46:17.760 --> 00:46:20.000
There's more work that you have to do to wire things together.

00:46:20.240 --> 00:46:25.760
But I feel like the biggest innovation in the open source world in the past 15 years has been packaging.

00:46:25.960 --> 00:46:31.400
Like every programming language has a PyPI style packaging solution of some sort.

00:46:31.960 --> 00:46:37.180
You've got cargo and you've got the Ruby gems and all of those kinds of things.

00:46:37.520 --> 00:46:39.860
And that pattern mostly works really, really well.

00:46:40.220 --> 00:46:45.780
But I just keep on coming back to that feeling that with Django, I know it's all going to work.

00:46:45.960 --> 00:46:47.740
And I know it's going to work far into the future.

00:46:47.820 --> 00:46:49.480
And that feels really valuable to me.

00:46:49.740 --> 00:46:50.140
Good, Adrian.

00:46:50.220 --> 00:46:59.620
For my answer, I think I'd have to evaluate it on a case-by-case basis, but the way I would evaluate it is to look at the origin of the project.

00:47:00.090 --> 00:47:07.080
Was it extracted from something from the real world or was it built either as an academic or for fun exercise?

00:47:07.520 --> 00:47:10.320
What was the reason for its existence?

00:47:10.980 --> 00:47:15.260
And generally, I trust stuff that was extracted from real production sites more.

00:47:15.680 --> 00:47:17.080
That's just my own preference.

00:47:17.660 --> 00:47:44.000
It's also sort of to flip it around. I never really cared whether someone used Django or not. I would evaluate you on your product, not based on like the web framework you use. Who cares really what web framework you use? And I think that kind of ethos may be seeped into Django at some point unintentionally. I mean, I never intentionally sort of made that, had that philosophy communicated, but yeah.

00:47:44.080 --> 00:47:49.720
I always felt like one of the most interesting difference between Rails and Django is that Rails was extracted from Basecamp.

00:47:49.830 --> 00:47:51.760
They built Basecamp and they pulled the framework out of it.

00:47:52.080 --> 00:47:57.320
I feel like Django was kind of reverse extracted from Lawrence.com because we had Lawrence.com.

00:47:57.350 --> 00:47:58.360
It was PHP and MySQL.

00:47:58.590 --> 00:48:03.960
And the goal with Django was always to get it to a point where it was good enough that it could replace the PHP in Lawrence.com.

00:48:04.200 --> 00:48:09.760
So everything that we were building was always like, what would Lawrence.com need in this new thing for us to replace it?

00:48:10.180 --> 00:48:13.160
And the end result was a framework that you could build Lawrence.com in.

00:48:13.300 --> 00:48:15.320
Lawrence.com was the entertainment website for the newspaper.

00:48:15.860 --> 00:48:19.860
It's the best local entertainment website for any city that has ever existed.

00:48:20.400 --> 00:48:22.400
I will very confidently state that.

00:48:22.560 --> 00:48:28.900
I've never lived in a city with a website as good for figuring out what the things to do in a town are.

00:48:29.050 --> 00:48:36.720
And that was Adrian's biggest project, Lawrence Journal World, was always Lawrence.com and evolving Django up to the point where it could power that site.

00:48:37.140 --> 00:48:38.100
It's what got me here.

00:48:38.400 --> 00:48:45.180
Like I saw that site living 200 miles away and went to San Francisco and kind of looked at Y Combinator and was like, you know, this is only 200 miles.

00:48:45.360 --> 00:48:47.740
Like they've got something good going here and that site especially.

00:48:48.960 --> 00:48:56.420
I think to a Django's batteries, Django, I think 20 years ago, Django, there was a lot of things that you had to do the Django way.

00:48:56.800 --> 00:49:00.800
And I think there's been so much concerted effort, especially the first 12 to 14 years.

00:49:01.220 --> 00:49:05.480
It's so much as pluggable that like if you don't like the batteries, I don't know what you're missing.

00:49:05.660 --> 00:49:07.240
Like Django is still a really good core.

00:49:07.680 --> 00:49:09.200
Don't use the admin if you don't want it.

00:49:09.680 --> 00:49:16.120
I think most of the problems I see, the foundation and the community, I think there's like a lot of lore that comes with Django.

00:49:16.570 --> 00:49:21.940
And it's like lore of like, maybe it's harder to change certain things on the website than it really needs to be or is.

00:49:22.240 --> 00:49:32.100
And I think this last year, we've definitely pushed back on, like, if you do a search on the Django docs now and you look for REST, you wouldn't know that Django is a REST framework or has the ability to do that by looking at the docs.

00:49:32.560 --> 00:49:40.240
And so these were just technical challenges of like certain steering council members have written articles and stuff, blog posts saying like, you can do rest with Django.

00:49:40.640 --> 00:49:42.500
There's some good third party packages to do it.

00:49:42.770 --> 00:49:47.300
In the past, we've kind of been like apprehensive to want to recommend third party packages through docs.

00:49:47.840 --> 00:49:49.040
I think that's just one of those.

00:49:49.130 --> 00:49:50.620
It sounds weird when I say it out loud.

00:49:50.890 --> 00:49:51.560
At least it does to me.

00:49:51.940 --> 00:49:57.420
And I think once we have these discussions, then we start like realizing that, well, we have a website that everybody comes to.

00:49:57.820 --> 00:50:02.720
There's very specifically doc sections and there's blog, but there's no search that pulls stuff in together.

00:50:03.050 --> 00:50:06.780
And so the steering council and different members have been trying to make search work across everything.

00:50:07.150 --> 00:50:15.680
And then that way you can get hits from rest and you can get hits for third party packages that the steering council recommends just because they're good packages everybody should use.

00:50:16.020 --> 00:50:21.380
And so I think some of the lore and some of the, hey, these things have been done this certain way doesn't mean we want to keep doing them.

00:50:21.680 --> 00:50:25.900
It's just probably somebody had an afternoon or a night and they made search work a particular way.

00:50:26.170 --> 00:50:27.400
And that was really good for the docs.

00:50:27.800 --> 00:50:30.060
but like sometime look up REST and look at PHP.

00:50:30.480 --> 00:50:33.580
There's actually more hits for PHP on the Django website than there are REST

00:50:33.900 --> 00:50:36.680
unless you get into like Sphinx, you know, restructured text.

00:50:37.020 --> 00:50:49.540
So, but those are challenges that until we talk about and we realize, and I think like that's the advent of a FastAPI kind of taking off is I think like Django didn't have a great REST story by looking at the docs and looking at information.

00:50:50.100 --> 00:50:54.740
At PyCon US this year, I had dozens of people ask me, how do I use the Django ORM from FastAPI?

00:50:54.900 --> 00:50:55.780
And it's like, why?

00:50:55.940 --> 00:50:56.560
You don't have to.

00:50:56.780 --> 00:50:59.700
Django is async enough that you don't need to do that.

00:50:59.840 --> 00:51:00.300
That's hard.

00:51:00.430 --> 00:51:01.600
And that kind of sucks to do.

00:51:01.780 --> 00:51:02.660
So why?

00:51:03.420 --> 00:51:06.320
And those are things we're focusing and talking about internally too.

00:51:06.620 --> 00:51:06.800
Yeah.

00:51:07.460 --> 00:51:22.860
Talking about search and search across different things, somewhat directly to you, Jeff, but all of you, and maybe Simon as well, is like, what about just like chat.djangoproject.com and do some rag on it and let people have a conversation with Django?

00:51:23.130 --> 00:51:23.560
You know what?

00:51:23.840 --> 00:51:40.120
We don't even need it because Django is stable enough that every chatbot out there knows Django inside out already. One of the great benefits of having great documentation and lots of examples for 20 years that is stable is, yeah, you can, GPT-5 will spit out a full Django project and just

00:51:40.130 --> 00:51:55.000
get it all right. So yeah, I completely disagree. I think we need a big sponsor who can come in, whether it's Anthropic or OpenAI or somebody else. We need a big sponsor, a title sponsor, even in fact that can help give the money for this and donate the chat.

00:51:55.440 --> 00:52:01.560
Because even though you're right that it isn't ingrained, you still have that delay between because Django kicks out a new version or two a year.

00:52:01.960 --> 00:52:04.320
And so there's always that lag of nine months or a year.

00:52:04.520 --> 00:52:08.860
And most of it recommends the most popular version, not the latest version or something like that.

00:52:08.940 --> 00:52:09.000
Right.

00:52:09.520 --> 00:52:09.820
Exactly.

00:52:09.900 --> 00:52:10.040
Yeah.

00:52:10.280 --> 00:52:14.440
Because I see a lot of demos where they're actually building Django apps using these, these tools.

00:52:14.640 --> 00:52:18.480
And so we're selling AI by virtue of Django and Django's docs being so good.

00:52:18.840 --> 00:52:24.880
Or occasionally one of these things will say that Sound Slice has a feature that it doesn't have, and then Adrian has to build the feature.

00:52:25.340 --> 00:52:25.720
Oh, God.

00:52:26.920 --> 00:52:29.380
Oh, you guys, in the chat, it's coming on here.

00:52:29.400 --> 00:52:32.140
We have Frank Wasson, but our chatbot can have a cool personality.

00:52:32.340 --> 00:52:39.360
And Kenneth loves to insert a random name every once in a while or something, you know, pony style.

00:52:40.640 --> 00:52:43.240
Adrian, what is the story behind that?

00:52:43.500 --> 00:52:44.800
Oh, it has nothing to do with Django.

00:52:46.200 --> 00:52:56.120
So yeah, just the 30 second version is ChatGPT was telling people about my site, my company sounds like having a feature that doesn't actually exist.

00:52:56.420 --> 00:52:58.360
And it was happening like dozens of times per day.

00:52:58.900 --> 00:53:03.340
And so we had this inbound set of users who had a wrong expectation.

00:53:03.880 --> 00:53:17.140
So we ended up just writing the feature to appease the ChatGPT gods, which I think is the first time that at least to my knowledge of uh yeah product decisions being influenced by

00:53:17.500 --> 00:53:22.440
misinformation from llms i just love that it's easier to just build the feature than to get the

00:53:22.640 --> 00:53:26.800
misinformation corrected like there is no he's got to backfill it he's got to backfill it

00:53:29.200 --> 00:54:24.840
incredible all right um that's crazy i let's let's do two more quick topics like somewhat lightning round, we have about six minutes left for this show. So one, there's been, you guys mentioned it a couple of times, and it's also just kind of going back and forth in the audience here, that the whole REST idea. So we've got, you know, Tom Christie doing amazing work with Django REST framework. We've also, I think, you know, people who do talk about FastAPI and how do I use the ORM with it, like Django Ninja, which is really, really close to FastAPI and so on. That's one side, that's a really positive side of things with Django. And the other side I think is, you know, I'm not a super fan of, but it's, it's something a lot of people do is, well, can we just make the backend a dumb crud API thing? And let me just write everything in JavaScript on the front end, which I'm not as much of a fan of. I think a lot of people choose that because they've been told that's how it's supposed to be. I don't think it needs to be that way.

00:54:25.260 --> 00:54:37.540
So what do you all feel about that? And sort of the, how this has an impact for Django, Because if people just see the backend as an API that's just a dumb thing, then a lot of the value that Django brings, I think, starts to vanish.

00:54:38.480 --> 00:54:39.940
You've got things like HTML and so on.

00:54:40.020 --> 00:54:41.140
So, yeah, what are your thoughts on all this?

00:54:41.340 --> 00:54:53.140
I think one of the hardest problems in computer science right now is talking a front-end team out of building everything as a pure JavaScript app, especially if that's developers who onboarded in web development over the past five to ten years.

00:54:54.320 --> 00:55:01.860
It's infuriating because my impression is that it just takes longer and you get more bugs and it's harder to build useful software.

00:55:02.140 --> 00:55:06.720
The one thing I will say is that HTMX has been a huge breath of fresh air on this front.

00:55:07.880 --> 00:55:11.020
HTMX gives you your single page applications.

00:55:11.520 --> 00:55:14.160
It's all stuff that's rendered server-side in templates.

00:55:14.370 --> 00:55:15.700
It fits really well with Django.

00:55:15.880 --> 00:55:19.020
There's a great Django extension for looking into HTMX.

00:55:19.380 --> 00:55:28.520
And I feel like that, the pendulum has just started swinging slightly back away from the everything must be rendered in JavaScript thing, partly because of the work that the HTMX people have been doing.

00:55:28.680 --> 00:55:30.480
So that I felt pretty good about.

00:55:30.980 --> 00:55:39.500
I'm going to point to Adrian now because SoundSlice is a pure JavaScript front-end app, and it should be based on what it does, right?

00:55:39.780 --> 00:55:40.940
Yeah, it's interactive sheet music.

00:55:41.200 --> 00:55:47.800
So it's sheet music that's rendered entirely in your browser, responsive, blah, blah, blah, with an editor, a lot of crazy JavaScript.

00:55:48.320 --> 00:55:54.820
But yeah, I mean, this is a whole other podcast episode about the horribleness of modern web development.

00:55:55.160 --> 00:56:00.660
I feel very lucky that I came up 20 years ago when before it got so insane.

00:56:02.020 --> 00:56:12.680
But yeah, I have sort of a related comment, which is I would like to see Django be a stronger advocate for the web in general.

00:56:13.120 --> 00:56:17.760
It doesn't matter if you're talking to developers or people using tech products.

00:56:18.280 --> 00:56:22.600
the expectation has been shifting away from the web to the phone for many, many reasons.

00:56:23.640 --> 00:56:25.320
And I don't like that.

00:56:25.500 --> 00:56:29.320
I'm pretty sure that most, if not all of the people on this chat don't like that either.

00:56:29.700 --> 00:56:34.060
And I don't really see a lot of effort being pushed in that direction.

00:56:34.560 --> 00:56:38.720
So just to sprinkle a little idea here.

00:56:39.120 --> 00:56:45.380
I personally wish that progressive web apps were more front and center, giving you an option at least like, okay, you have to be on the phone,

00:56:45.600 --> 00:56:47.600
but could we package it up a little more?

00:56:47.880 --> 00:56:51.740
There's a really exciting development there that's finally beginning to be rolled out.

00:56:51.860 --> 00:57:05.700
There's this thing called view transitions in CSS, where you can have a little bit of CSS that says, "And when the user goes from one page to another, keep the navigation bar in the same place and do a quick blur effect for this piece here." It means that...

00:57:05.810 --> 00:57:07.480
And it's been supported in Chrome for a few years.

00:57:07.640 --> 00:57:08.880
It's finally rolling out through the browsers.

00:57:09.190 --> 00:57:14.440
It means you can build something that feels like a slick app with page transitions and so forth, but it's not.

00:57:14.720 --> 00:57:16.300
It's just boring old HTML and CSS.

00:57:16.780 --> 00:57:18.200
No JavaScript required at all.

00:57:18.580 --> 00:57:20.480
Gives you that experience much faster to load.

00:57:20.790 --> 00:57:24.080
And I have been itching to see this start showing up.

00:57:24.090 --> 00:57:29.880
And I think it's finally this year, I feel, is the year where the browser support is good enough that we can start really depending on this.

00:57:30.240 --> 00:57:36.920
And yeah, because it gives you that app-like experience on a boring old website, which is, I feel like, that's the thing that we all want.

00:57:37.160 --> 00:57:41.060
So back to part of Adrian's piece, and sorry, Tebow, real quick.

00:57:41.480 --> 00:57:43.900
My second thing I have to pitch is because of what Adrian was saying.

00:57:44.600 --> 00:57:51.340
I think because systematically we, you know, we are really lucky to be around for 20 years because we've had nothing but volunteer leadership in years.

00:57:51.960 --> 00:57:55.320
One thing we want to do is find an executive director, somebody that can run the foundation.

00:57:55.670 --> 00:57:57.780
The biggest reason goes back to Adrian's point.

00:57:57.970 --> 00:58:06.880
I think that we sometimes don't get a seat at the table when it comes to web standards, when it comes to these conversations, is because it's the cycling of Thibaut being the president now.

00:58:06.890 --> 00:58:07.800
It was Frank before.

00:58:07.850 --> 00:58:08.980
It was Anna from Africa.

00:58:09.220 --> 00:58:11.720
We've had many really good presidents over the years.

00:58:11.980 --> 00:58:16.340
But it's really hard to work with foundations and nonprofits when you don't have a set person.

00:58:16.700 --> 00:58:19.120
Even our fellows seem to rotate every three to four years.

00:58:19.400 --> 00:58:22.980
And so that's part of like Django growing up, which is something I would love to see us do.

00:58:23.340 --> 00:58:26.120
And then Thibault, I love the fact that this started off in the middle of like the day.

00:58:26.320 --> 00:58:28.600
And now it is like perfectly cycled to like dark.

00:58:28.600 --> 00:58:30.700
Yeah, I guess it was high and curve you as president.

00:58:30.840 --> 00:58:31.220
Go ahead.

00:58:31.960 --> 00:58:35.680
To me, there's a developer experience and like keeping devs happy.

00:58:36.040 --> 00:58:46.680
So, you know, when we say our people go to React or whichever like JS heavy, It's also because they think they need it to build whatever complexity that they are after, but also because they think it has good DX, I assume.

00:58:47.340 --> 00:58:57.100
So when we say like the REST framework or the Django Ninja, to me, it's this as well, that we have to be aware of what's the evolving standards for what devs want to do with their web.

00:58:57.340 --> 00:59:05.900
And I guess how we can make Django meet that, whether it's better types, better CLI, better packaging, more Rust, maybe, whichever.

00:59:06.500 --> 00:59:12.140
Will, do you want to get a quick word in on this everything's a front-end thing now before we move on to the last bit?

00:59:12.600 --> 00:59:16.580
Oh, sure. I'm just going to say, and this probably goes back to Adrian and Simon, like all of them,

00:59:16.960 --> 00:59:25.340
it seems very wise to keep the front-end light because there was certainly 10 years ago a lot of pressure to integrate React or Vue or Angular or something.

00:59:25.500 --> 00:59:31.440
But the fact that it's remained just the Django templates means HTMX can rise and we can have more innovation.

00:59:32.040 --> 00:59:37.240
And just shout out, Carson Gross of HTMX is giving the keynote at DjangoCon US in three weeks.

00:59:37.650 --> 00:59:43.240
So even though he's not a Django developer, he's in fact more of a, he's a professor who does Java and obviously JavaScript.

00:59:43.700 --> 00:59:48.880
It still slides into Django in a way that if Django had built out the front end story, we wouldn't be able to.

00:59:49.120 --> 00:59:50.580
I love how that also fits.

00:59:50.840 --> 00:59:59.720
DjangoCon has had a long tradition of having a keynote from somebody from outside the community, which started in 2008 with Cal Henderson at DjangoCon over in Mountain View.

01:00:00.840 --> 01:00:01.920
Was that the why I hate Django?

01:00:02.130 --> 01:00:05.640
Because there was that whole history of, I feel like there should be another one of those, you know?

01:00:06.059 --> 01:00:06.780
Absolutely, yeah.

01:00:07.620 --> 01:00:08.240
But that's great.

01:00:08.360 --> 01:00:10.720
That's a fantastic keynote for DjangoCon, I think.

01:00:10.960 --> 01:00:12.920
Yeah, and coming up in Chicago, right?

01:00:13.190 --> 01:00:13.560
Pretty soon.

01:00:13.760 --> 01:00:16.760
So if you are in or would like to be, go check it out, right?

01:00:16.860 --> 01:00:18.600
That's part of that community thing I talked about.

01:00:19.020 --> 01:00:26.020
And people listening who are not watching, listening, not watching, they don't realize that you did this outside.

01:00:26.760 --> 01:00:32.440
And there's a great comment from Kojo saying, It's really cool that you're using in real life dark mode.

01:00:32.680 --> 01:00:32.960
It's great.

01:00:34.120 --> 01:00:35.980
All right, let's close it out with this, everyone.

01:00:36.440 --> 01:00:37.320
We're pretty much out of time.

01:00:37.820 --> 01:00:40.580
20 years, you know, amazing, amazing stuff.

01:00:42.359 --> 01:00:45.120
We're celebrating Django having its birthday, right?

01:00:45.360 --> 01:00:46.760
But it's going to live on for a long time.

01:00:46.860 --> 01:00:48.160
There's a ton of code.

01:00:48.280 --> 01:00:50.400
There's a ton of things people are doing with Django.

01:00:51.500 --> 01:00:53.560
Even if you guys step away at some point, it's still going to be going.

01:00:54.030 --> 01:00:57.460
So give me your, you know, going around and starting with Will, I guess.

01:00:57.690 --> 01:00:59.680
Give me your forward-looking thoughts on Django.

01:00:59.700 --> 01:01:01.120
over the next five, 10 years?

01:01:02.140 --> 01:01:14.600
Well, I think it's integrating with AI, broadly defined, however that means, because in a way related to Adrian's point, like the boring old web has never been more relevant, even though we're focused on chatbots right now, you still need all the other things.

01:01:15.010 --> 01:01:16.520
And Django can integrate into that.

01:01:16.530 --> 01:01:22.620
And I think it's always kind of a marketing problem for Django because we don't have one person in charge or a company behind it.

01:01:22.740 --> 01:01:26.620
So telling the story of we've been here, there's still double digit PRs.

01:01:26.840 --> 01:01:28.460
It has async in many areas.

01:01:28.980 --> 01:01:34.180
And I worry that the next generation of web developers just skip it because they don't know what it already has.

01:01:34.570 --> 01:01:37.940
And they have this presumption that it's too hard to learn, which it's not.

01:01:38.240 --> 01:01:38.660
Yeah, absolutely.

01:01:39.220 --> 01:01:39.520
Is it me?

01:01:40.140 --> 01:01:40.720
It is you.

01:01:41.100 --> 01:01:41.640
I don't have any.

01:01:41.900 --> 01:01:43.200
I hear you're boring about the web.

01:01:43.380 --> 01:01:44.040
What's going on now?

01:01:44.480 --> 01:01:46.120
Tell us about what do you see for the future?

01:01:46.560 --> 01:01:46.980
For the future.

01:01:47.460 --> 01:01:55.880
Yeah, I'm actually, perhaps ironically, like the worst person to ask because I have worked on the same app for almost 13 straight years full time now.

01:01:57.040 --> 01:02:00.780
I use Django every day and it does everything I need.

01:02:01.160 --> 01:02:04.200
So I'm very happy with the current state.

01:02:05.020 --> 01:02:21.080
And I think, like I said earlier, if it were up to me, the thing I would focus on is more philosophical or trying to promote the concept of the web versus non-web stuff.

01:02:21.400 --> 01:02:23.800
Because if the web goes away, Django goes away.

01:02:23.920 --> 01:02:25.640
I mean, it's inherent.

01:02:25.720 --> 01:02:27.080
A lot of beautiful things go away, yeah.

01:02:27.260 --> 01:02:28.420
A lot of beautiful things go away.

01:02:28.840 --> 01:02:32.540
So I think that would be my hope for the next five years.

01:02:32.980 --> 01:02:38.700
Yeah, I've done combat with the App Store review people, both Apple and Google, and it is not pretty.

01:02:38.880 --> 01:02:39.780
We do not want the web.

01:02:40.420 --> 01:02:43.120
There's definitely AI in there and definitely the web.

01:02:43.580 --> 01:02:45.620
I really like that you mentioned the view transitions.

01:02:46.520 --> 01:03:00.520
I think if web technologies get that much better in the next five years or so, we can match what's possible with a mobile dev, but not only match it, but in terms of accessibility and how many people you can reach with a web app.

01:03:00.920 --> 01:03:02.540
We can go far, far beyond.

01:03:03.260 --> 01:03:17.960
So I guess to me for that, the other side is having a foundation behind Django that's probably a bit more professional, that takes it a bit more seriously, that we're the people looking after the framework for millions of devs at this point.

01:03:18.460 --> 01:03:22.380
And as you said, the people in this room, we come and go, that's very natural.

01:03:22.680 --> 01:03:24.480
So just making sure that we have the pipelines.

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:33.920
So hopefully five, 10 more years, you know, the Django node space you mentioned earlier, that's the people who will be the presidents and people having this podcast maybe in 10 years time.

01:03:34.240 --> 01:03:36.220
Yeah, absolutely. Jeff?

01:03:36.540 --> 01:03:38.760
I'm really curious to see what Rust's impact is.

01:03:38.790 --> 01:03:41.460
I think Python is just getting so much faster, so much better.

01:03:41.800 --> 01:03:45.180
And I know there's some really smart people working on like WebAssembly and Rust.

01:03:45.580 --> 01:03:51.240
And I dream of a day when a Django view can be the same thing in your browser as it is on the server.

01:03:51.600 --> 01:03:58.760
And I think when we look at like talking to a query set, your browser, you know, doing data exchange, serialization, JSON, something.

01:03:59.130 --> 01:04:08.620
I feel like in the next five years, there's this there's this opportunity that whatever Python is becoming, whatever Django is becoming that like, you know, it's less about how are we going to use React and render?

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:10.040
I hate React, by the way.

01:04:10.100 --> 01:04:11.040
You've got to put that plug in.

01:04:11.300 --> 01:04:18.440
But I'm just really curious to see like how these things can kind of mold together as, you know, developer experiences have gotten a lot better because of tooling and Rust.

01:04:18.840 --> 01:04:27.800
There's just this whole new world that I see as far as these technologies that start to marry the two together in a way that we just haven't been able to do for a while.

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:29.660
But we're starting to see glimpses of it.

01:04:29.820 --> 01:04:30.140
For sure.

01:04:30.420 --> 01:04:31.680
Simon, final word for...

01:04:31.860 --> 01:04:35.440
I'm going to double down a little bit on the WebAssembly stuff is so exciting.

01:04:36.059 --> 01:04:39.800
Pyodide, the thing that lets you run Python in your browser, is now at least 10 years old.

01:04:39.920 --> 01:04:41.600
It's very, very good.

01:04:42.020 --> 01:04:43.400
It's about a two megabyte download.

01:04:43.610 --> 01:04:46.020
A few years ago, I'd have said two megabyte downloads is too much.

01:04:46.080 --> 01:04:49.220
These days, 2 megabyte download for a web page is hardly anything at all.

01:04:49.860 --> 01:04:54.560
But I feel like the thing that I love most about Django these days is it is reliable.

01:04:55.060 --> 01:04:56.340
It's so dependable.

01:04:56.740 --> 01:05:03.340
Nobody ever picks Django for a project and regrets it because Django, it's mature, it's stable, it's well documented.

01:05:03.380 --> 01:05:04.340
It moves at a sensible place.

01:05:04.880 --> 01:05:05.940
Long may that continue.

01:05:06.100 --> 01:05:08.520
I love the idea that Django becomes...

01:05:08.520 --> 01:05:13.140
And Django for many years has been a great default technology for you to use as a project.

01:05:13.640 --> 01:05:17.780
And if we double down on that, which I think is what we're doing already, that's fantastic for me.

01:05:17.840 --> 01:05:20.360
I love that idea that you can always pick Django.

01:05:20.500 --> 01:05:22.200
It will always do what you need it to do.

01:05:22.240 --> 01:05:26.400
There will never be any nasty surprises or sort of regrets from working with that.

01:05:26.660 --> 01:05:35.740
And if we can tap into things like free-threaded Python is coming along now, which is very well, it means maybe we don't have to rewrite everything as async things just to handle large concurrency.

01:05:35.880 --> 01:05:38.120
There's all of that kind of stuff, the WebAssembly stuff.

01:05:38.380 --> 01:05:41.440
It feels like the Python ecosystem is in a really good shape.

01:05:41.900 --> 01:05:44.800
And Django sits very close to the center of that ecosystem.

01:05:45.020 --> 01:05:46.660
And I'm really excited about that.

01:05:46.660 --> 01:05:51.760
I love that we can continue to provide the best default option for building great things.

01:05:52.200 --> 01:05:53.060
Yeah, totally agree.

01:05:53.380 --> 01:05:54.020
All right, everyone.

01:05:54.510 --> 01:05:55.560
Thank you so much for being here.

01:05:55.940 --> 01:05:56.780
Happy birthday, Django.

01:05:57.960 --> 01:05:58.860
Happy birthday, Django.

01:05:59.660 --> 01:06:00.240
Thanks, Michael.

01:06:01.580 --> 01:06:04.040
This has been another episode of Talk Python To Me.

01:06:04.860 --> 01:06:05.820
Thank you to our sponsors.

01:06:06.300 --> 01:06:07.500
Be sure to check out what they're offering.

01:06:07.640 --> 01:06:08.940
It really helps support the show.

01:06:09.720 --> 01:06:12.500
This episode is brought to you entirely by Sentry.

01:06:12.840 --> 01:06:14.980
It's a bit of an episode takeover, if you will.

01:06:15.540 --> 01:06:19.360
Sentry has two excellent and exciting services to tell you about.

01:06:19.840 --> 01:06:29.960
Sear, your agentic AI debugging assistant, which takes all the data already gathered by Sentry to help discover the problems and even propose fixes as GitHub PRs.

01:06:30.560 --> 01:06:37.060
And the other is AI agent monitoring, which adds deep observability to your AI agents in your app.

01:06:37.280 --> 01:06:42.780
If you're adding AI and LLM features to your Python apps, you'll want to know about AI agent monitoring.

01:06:43.420 --> 01:06:45.600
I'll tell you more about both of these later in the episode.

01:06:46.060 --> 01:06:53.260
And remember, however you happen to sign up for Sentry, if you do, use our code TALKPYTHON, one word, all caps.

01:06:53.920 --> 01:06:54.780
Want to level up your Python?

01:06:55.240 --> 01:06:59.020
We have one of the largest catalogs of Python video courses over at TALKPYTHON.

01:06:59.360 --> 01:07:04.060
Our content ranges from true beginners to deeply advanced topics like memory and async.

01:07:04.400 --> 01:07:06.680
And best of all, there's not a subscription in sight.

01:07:07.160 --> 01:07:09.600
Check it out for yourself at training.talkpython.fm.

01:07:10.300 --> 01:07:14.480

This is your host, Michael Kennedy. Thanks so much for listening. I really appreciate it.

01:07:40.820 --> 01:07:42.400
Now get out there and write some Python code.

01:07:54.420 --> 01:07:57.220
I'm out.
