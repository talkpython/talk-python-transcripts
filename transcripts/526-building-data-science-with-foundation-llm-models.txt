00:00:00 <v Michael Kennedy>AI has changed how we write code and data science is right in the blast radius.

00:00:04 <v Michael Kennedy>Today we move past autocomplete to systems that file PRs, comment in Slack, and even police our CI.

00:00:11 <v Michael Kennedy>Hugo Bown Anderson is back to map the new stack.

00:00:14 <v Michael Kennedy>When classic PyData still wins, where small local models beat the cloud, and how tests become your specs.

00:00:21 <v Michael Kennedy>We dig into cursor and copilot, proactive agents, and practical patterns you can ship this week.

00:00:26 <v Michael Kennedy>This episode is all about leveling up your data science workflow, not replacing it.

00:00:31 <v Michael Kennedy>This is Talk Python To Me, episode 526, recorded October 7th, 2025.

00:02:24 <v Michael Kennedy>Hey, I want to take just a minute and talk to you guys.

00:02:26 <v Michael Kennedy>I just released a really cool new course called <v Michael Kennedy>Agentic AI Programming for Python Developers and Data Scientists.

00:02:33 <v Michael Kennedy>You've heard me mention a couple times on the podcast

00:02:36 <v Michael Kennedy>how I've had some incredible success with some of these agentic AI coding tools.

00:02:41 <v Michael Kennedy>I hear people talking about how they're not really working for them.

00:02:45 <v Michael Kennedy>And then I look at the results that I'm getting and think, wow, that's something that would

00:02:49 <v Michael Kennedy>have taken two weeks.

00:02:50 <v Michael Kennedy>It's built in two hours and it's well factored and good looking code.

00:02:56 <v Michael Kennedy>What gives?

00:02:57 <v Michael Kennedy>Why is this difference here?

00:02:58 <v Michael Kennedy>Well, I decided to create this course to share all the things that I'm doing with these agentic

00:03:05 <v Michael Kennedy>coding tools with the idea of making you as successful and productive as well.

00:03:09 <v Michael Kennedy>Yes, I know we're all tired about hearing about how AI is going to change everything for software developers.

00:03:15 <v Michael Kennedy>But there are some tools here that will give you truly difference-making levels of productivity.

00:03:21 <v Michael Kennedy>And that's what this course is about.

00:03:23 <v Michael Kennedy>So check it out at talkpython.fm/agentic AI.

00:03:27 <v Michael Kennedy>The link's in your podcast player show notes.

00:03:29 <v Michael Kennedy>Let's get to the interview.

00:03:31 <v Michael Kennedy>Hey, Hugo. Welcome to Talk Python.

00:03:33 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>Awesome to have you, man.

00:03:33 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>Such a pleasure to be here and to be back.

00:03:36 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>I think this is my third time over the years on Talk Python.

00:03:39 <v Michael Kennedy>I do think it is your third time.

00:03:41 <v Michael Kennedy>It's been a lot of fun data science things.

00:03:43 <v Michael Kennedy>And I think people will see that our conversation, <v Michael Kennedy>the thing that we're going to really focus on this time,

00:03:49 <v Michael Kennedy>will have evolved a little bit as the times have changed.

00:03:52 <v Michael Kennedy>Since the last couple of years, <v Michael Kennedy>the data science and the entirety of programming has gotten a little different.

00:03:57 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>Actually, just our conversations over the years, <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>like kind of art can be a symbol of the trajectory

00:04:03 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>from like early days of data science, <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>PyDataStack, all of these amazing things

00:04:07 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>as it went from academia to industry.

00:04:09 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>then to, you know, large-scale distributed compute

00:04:11 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>when I came and talked about Dask and Coiled.

00:04:14 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>And now a couple of years after our quote-unquote GPT moment

00:04:17 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>and our ChatGPT moment and our stable diffusion moment

00:04:19 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>here to talk about LLM's foundation models meet data science.

00:04:22 <v Michael Kennedy>That's right.

00:04:22 <v Michael Kennedy>We've gone from local machine to cloud, AI.

00:04:27 <v Michael Kennedy>Wow.

00:04:27 <v Michael Kennedy>I do see that we'll actually maybe be back.

00:04:29 <v Michael Kennedy>I see a world where we build together smaller models <v Michael Kennedy>that maybe run locally, doing other things,

00:04:36 <v Michael Kennedy>Maybe some servers, connect MCP servers, connecting all these things, like little special agents.

00:04:41 <v Michael Kennedy>That's going to be something we can potentially dive into.

00:04:44 <v Michael Kennedy>We'll see.

00:04:44 <v Michael Kennedy>But I think the arc is not done.

00:04:46 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>The other thing that comes to mind is I do, and we'll get into this with AI-assisted programming,

00:04:50 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>which I think superpowers people who know what they're doing, but may not be great for beginners.

00:04:56 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>I do imagine we might have boot camps or classes where you're in a cave and no access to AI

00:05:02 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>or the internet and you learn, you actually learn to code on a laptop without any of this stuff.

00:05:07 <v Michael Kennedy>Yeah. There's going to be a local PyPI and be a local set of docs. You know, there was this really

00:05:12 <v Michael Kennedy>cool app. Gosh, I've covered on Python bytes, the news podcast I do. And I wish I could remember,

00:05:18 <v Michael Kennedy>but what it would do is it had like hundreds, maybe thousands of different projects like Flask

00:05:24 <v Michael Kennedy>or Tailwind or whatever, Span Technologies. And you could click it and say, I want to have Flask

00:05:30 <v Michael Kennedy>3.1 offline, get me the docs.

00:05:33 <v Michael Kennedy>And you could create like a catalog <v Michael Kennedy>of all these different projects you're using,

00:05:36 <v Michael Kennedy>all offline searchable docs across.

00:05:39 <v Michael Kennedy>Amazing.

00:05:39 <v Michael Kennedy>I feel like something like that might come back.

00:05:41 <v Michael Kennedy>You know what I mean?

00:05:42 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>It's funny you mentioned that <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>because I was chatting with Innes Montani

00:05:44 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>of spaCy and Prodigy fame the other night.

00:05:47 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>She's here in Sydney.

00:05:48 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>And she reminded me that Sebastian Ramirez <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>of FastAPI,

00:05:52 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>when he was building FastAPI originally, <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>I think what she reminded me was

00:05:56 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>they didn't have great internet access <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>where they were.

00:05:59 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>So they did download a lot of things at very slow speeds, then build everything locally.

00:06:04 <v Michael Kennedy>I'm reliving that, by the way, in a very weird way.

00:06:07 <v Michael Kennedy>My fiber modem died.

00:06:08 <v Michael Kennedy>And if anybody watches the video, they'll see that I'm actually in the library here, which is great.

00:06:12 <v Michael Kennedy>I preserve a little private room.

00:06:13 <v Michael Kennedy>I got high speed internet here.

00:06:15 <v Michael Kennedy>But at home, I'm tethered with one bar of LTE.

00:06:18 <v Michael Kennedy>So anything I do is at like 30 kilobits.

00:06:20 <v Michael Kennedy>And it brings me back to my youth.

00:06:22 <v Michael Kennedy>But boy, you got to decide what you want to do next.

00:06:24 <v Michael Kennedy>That's it.

00:06:25 <v Michael Kennedy>Yeah.

00:06:25 <v Michael Kennedy>So I do, circling back and closing this up, <v Michael Kennedy>I do think this true learning the code thing is both,

00:06:32 <v Michael Kennedy>it's going to be something that comes back around.

00:06:33 <v Michael Kennedy>I think it's actually a challenge with all the tools and cheats.

00:06:38 <v Michael Kennedy>I don't consider them bad cheats, but the things that can do the work for you,

00:06:41 <v Michael Kennedy>it requires a lot of willpower to stay focused.

00:06:44 <v Michael Kennedy>And I do think it's going to be kind of a kobold moment as well,

00:06:47 <v Michael Kennedy>where somewhere down the line, people are going to be like,

00:06:49 <v Michael Kennedy>we need to just get some people that used to type this stuff in by hand.

00:06:53 <v Michael Kennedy>And we need them to look at it and figure out why this doesn't work.

00:06:55 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>Without a doubt.

00:06:56 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>And, you know, learn Python the hard way.

00:06:58 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>Learn X the hard way.

00:06:59 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>Like sometimes most things you got to do the work, right?

00:07:02 <v Michael Kennedy>You definitely do.

00:07:03 <v Michael Kennedy>Well, Hugo, before we get into the topic too much, quick introduction on yourself.

00:07:08 <v Michael Kennedy>Who are you?

00:07:09 <v Michael Kennedy>I know you've been on the show a few times, but it's spanned many years and I say it often,

00:07:12 <v Michael Kennedy>but it's always worth repeating.

00:07:13 <v Michael Kennedy>And like 50% of the people in the Python community are new over the last two years.

00:07:18 <v Michael Kennedy>Like they've only been here two years or less, which blows my mind.

00:07:21 <v Michael Kennedy>So those people probably want to listen to the podcast before they got into Python.

00:07:23 <v Michael Kennedy>Who are you?

00:07:24 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>So firstly, what is up Python community?

00:07:26 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>Clearly, I'm a huge fan of Python.

00:07:28 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>Used it for many years.

00:07:28 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>Love it.

00:07:29 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>Background many moons ago in scientific research, biology, math, physics.

00:07:33 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>Was working in academic research at Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut.

00:07:37 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>Living in New York City just over a decade ago.

00:07:40 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>The data science ML meetups, hackathons there blew my mind so much.

00:07:44 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>Moved to industry, a small startup at the time, Datacamp.

00:07:48 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>Worked on curriculum, education, internal data science product.

00:07:52 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>Wore many hats, as you do.

00:07:53 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>And worked a lot on Pythonic education there.

00:07:56 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>Since then, I've been working in a mixture of DevRel, marketing, product.

00:08:00 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>A year and a half ago on wonderful projects, such as Dask at Coiled with Matt Rocklin,

00:08:04 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>then Metaflow out of Netflix with the wonderful team at Outer Bounds.

00:08:08 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>A year and a half ago or so, space was so exciting, man.

00:08:12 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>I decided to go freelance.

00:08:13 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>And so I mixed my time, essentially helping people build, ship, and maintain AI, LLM, ML, data-powered products more generally.

00:08:23 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>I do this through consulting.

00:08:25 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>I do it through advising.

00:08:27 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>I do it through education and developer relations.

00:08:30 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>So helping open source frameworks and products reach developers and getting material that

00:08:35 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>helps them.

00:08:36 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>My former colleague and boss at Outer Bounds, Vilay, who really gets developer relations,

00:08:41 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>refers to DevRel as the wisdom layer.

00:08:44 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>And he puts it firmly beside product as a pillar.

00:08:47 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>And I love that because I think a lot of the time we consider education or DevRel as a

00:08:52 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>necessary thing you have to do as opposed to being at a foundational pillar. And once again,

00:08:58 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>that's why I'm in such admiration of the work you do in bringing so many resources to the community

00:09:03 <v Michael Kennedy>at large. Thank you. And foreshadowing a little bit, I would like to kind of reinforce that quote

00:09:09 <v Michael Kennedy>you just said. It's the wisdom layer. Like as data scientists, your job is to provide insight

00:09:15 <v Michael Kennedy>and knowledge and trends, forecasting. Developers, our job is to provide solutions and things that

00:09:22 <v Michael Kennedy>that we can use apps and tools and whatnot. And I think a lot of us, myself included,

00:09:27 <v Michael Kennedy>get tied down and like, oh, I'm really good at coding and I'm good at this library.

00:09:32 <v Michael Kennedy>And we can kind of forget that like the real first tier job of ours is to provide answers

00:09:39 <v Michael Kennedy>and solutions and apps. And I think a lot of the pushback on AI is like, it's taken my coding.

00:09:44 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>One way I think about it is it has taken my coding in some ways, but as we'll get to,

00:09:49 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>I never particularly enjoyed writing, love Pandas, never particularly enjoyed writing

00:09:54 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>Pandas code, for example, incredible tool.

00:09:56 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>But if I can help me write my Pandas code, I read it, make sure it's all good in the

00:10:01 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>hood.

00:10:01 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>And then I get to focus on building systems.

00:10:04 <v Michael Kennedy>I think that's a huge win.

00:10:05 <v Michael Kennedy>100%.

00:10:06 <v Michael Kennedy>I would be remiss to not give a little shout out to a couple of things that you have done

00:10:10 <v Michael Kennedy>or are doing.

00:10:11 <v Michael Kennedy>Take it chronologically.

00:10:13 <v Michael Kennedy>A while ago, you worked on the fundamentals of Dask, high performance data science course

00:10:18 <v Michael Kennedy>over at Talk Python.

00:10:18 <v Michael Kennedy>This course is 100% free.

00:10:20 <v Michael Kennedy>People want to dive into it and learn from you.

00:10:22 <v Michael Kennedy>They can absolutely take it.

00:10:23 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>I might even take it now.

00:10:24 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>It's free.

00:10:24 <v Michael Kennedy>It's just over an hour.

00:10:26 <v Michael Kennedy>Yeah, people can drop in and I'll be sure to put a link in the show notes for that.

00:10:29 <v Michael Kennedy>So that's awesome.

00:10:30 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>That was really fun to build with you as well, Michael.

00:10:33 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>That was during the early days of COVID we were working on that.

00:10:35 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>So, you know.

00:10:36 <v Michael Kennedy>What else do we have to do?

00:10:37 <v Michael Kennedy>No, it was really great working on it with you as well.

00:10:40 <v Michael Kennedy>I appreciate that tons.

00:10:41 <v Michael Kennedy>And then you since then have started a data podcast called Vanishing Gradients.

00:10:47 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>Exactly.

00:10:48 <v Michael Kennedy>Tell people about that.

00:10:49 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>So this is a podcast and I still call it a data podcast.

00:10:52 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>Although a lot of people like you have to call it AI, Hugo.

00:10:54 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>And AI is data.

00:10:56 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>And as we'll get to a lot of the principles in building AI powered products are the same.

00:11:00 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>Modulo implementation details of building data powered products.

00:11:03 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>It's a podcast where I talk with industry practitioners and builders about what they're

00:11:09 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>doing in the space, how they're building, and essentially trying to help propagate knowledge

00:11:13 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>from the bleeding edge back to builders and leaders in the space. So recently had a conversation

00:11:20 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>with Hamil Hussain there, who he's the evals guy, among other things, but all about the eval space

00:11:26 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>and how you can use evaluation in the LLM powered software development lifecycle to improve your

00:11:32 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>product. I've spoken with Shell Genteman at NASA, conversations with Jeremy Howard. So one of the

00:11:40 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>things, as I'm sure you do, I love about podcasting is I get to invite people I admire and who I think

00:11:45 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>are awesome to chat about stuff and then share it with the public. So that's the rationale there.

00:11:50 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>But it's really to help people propagate knowledge, wisdom, and skills back the adoption curve.

00:11:56 <v Michael Kennedy>Along the adoption curve. That's good work. Who should listen to it? Beginners, experts,

00:12:00 <v Michael Kennedy>data people, programmers? Everyone should listen to it. Everyone who's interested in building and

00:12:05 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>shipping data-powered stuff. And the way I actually chat about it with guests is the first third of

00:12:11 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>any conversation, I want everyone to understand, everyone who's somewhat technical. The middle,

00:12:16 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>we can go a bit deeper. And the third is a free-for-all. I definitely encourage everyone to

00:12:21 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>jump in. And we've got specific episodes on evals, of course, and that type of stuff.

00:12:26 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>But we also have industry-specific episodes, such as chatting about what was happening in the

00:12:31 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>early days of shipping LLM-powered software at Honeycomb or at NASA and these types of places.

00:12:36 <v Michael Kennedy>That is one of the little secrets of being podcast hosts is you get to talk to people about

00:12:41 <v Michael Kennedy>amazing stuff. You're like, huh, it'd be really cool to talk to the people that made that

00:12:45 <v Michael Kennedy>Fusion breakthrough. They did Python. Why don't we invite them? And don't draw by,

00:12:48 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>you know, that's amazing. And I get like a lot of my friends who work in the space connect me

00:12:51 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>with other people. So I'm actually chatting with a data leader at Mozilla and then the VP of

00:12:55 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>learning at Duolingo. So we're going to have a lot of really fun episodes coming up. What's up with

00:12:59 <v Michael Kennedy>the name, Vanishing Gradients? Where'd that come from? There's the Vanishing Gradient problem

00:13:04 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>in deep learning. So when you do stochastic gradient descent, you compute gradients and

00:13:08 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>climb down in order to optimize neural networks. And there's a challenge that sometimes gradients

00:13:14 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>vanish and you stop learning. So the rationale was, what happens when you stop learning? And

00:13:20 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>let's bring back the idea of learning in this space. The opposite, of course, is the exploding

00:13:24 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>gradients problem, which I also considered calling it, where the gradients just explode, of course,

00:13:29 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>But we went with vanishing for that reason.

00:13:30 <v Michael Kennedy>I like that.

00:13:31 <v Michael Kennedy>That's a very clever, very subtle.

00:13:34 <v Michael Kennedy>Nice.

00:13:34 <v Michael Kennedy>So let's talk data science in 2025.

00:13:38 <v Michael Kennedy>And to be clear, I didn't ask, <v Michael Kennedy>let's talk using AI for data science.

00:13:44 <v Michael Kennedy>Let's talk data science in 2025.

00:13:46 <v Michael Kennedy>And surely, I think there's two things here.

00:13:48 <v Michael Kennedy>I think there's some really interesting, <v Michael Kennedy>what I don't know how we want to think about,

00:13:51 <v Michael Kennedy>like pure programming libraries and tools <v Michael Kennedy>that are super powerful.

00:13:56 <v Michael Kennedy>And we could give a quick shout out to some of them.

00:13:58 <v Michael Kennedy>But then also, anytime you're exploring data, using some of these LLMs, especially the agentic

00:14:04 <v Michael Kennedy>tooling, it's a game changer.

00:14:05 <v Michael Kennedy>So let's start with the first one.

00:14:07 <v Michael Kennedy>What tools, you know, things like polars maybe or whatever is like jumping out at you over

00:14:12 <v Michael Kennedy>the last year or so that's like, wow.

00:14:14 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>I chatted about this on Vanishing Gradients with Akshay Agrawal, who built Marimo and

00:14:20 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>develops Marimo, which I encourage everyone to check out.

00:14:23 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>So let's actually rewind slightly and think about what we've been using over the past decade,

00:14:29 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>plus plus.

00:14:29 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>And it's the PyData stack, Jupyter Notebooks, Pandas, SQL, SQLite databases, and in production,

00:14:37 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>maybe Postgres and these types of things.

00:14:40 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>And how has this evolved now?

00:14:42 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>What are modern, really cutting edge tools that we use in similar ways?

00:14:46 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>You mentioned polars.

00:14:47 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>I totally agree that this is something we're seeing a lot of activity on and a lot of use

00:14:52 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>on.

00:14:52 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>On the database side, we've got DuckDB, right?

00:14:54 <v Michael Kennedy>DuckDB is making a huge impact.

00:14:56 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>Beautiful to use, but it's so fast as well, right?

00:14:59 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>And I mean, and that's what you want there.

00:15:01 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>And then on the literate programming side, <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>you've got Marimo, which I'm a huge fan of.

00:15:08 <v Michael Kennedy>This portion of Talk Python To Me <v Michael Kennedy>is brought to you by the folks at Posit.

00:15:11 <v Michael Kennedy>Posit has made a huge investment <v Michael Kennedy>in the Python community lately.

00:15:15 <v Michael Kennedy>Known originally for RStudio, <v Michael Kennedy>they've been building out a suite of tools

00:15:18 <v Michael Kennedy>and services for Team Python.

00:15:21 <v Michael Kennedy>Over the past few years, we've all learned some pretty scary terms.

00:15:25 <v Michael Kennedy>Hypersquatting, supply chain attack, obfuscated code, and more.

00:15:30 <v Michael Kennedy>These all orbit around the idea that when you install Python packages,

00:15:34 <v Michael Kennedy>you're effectively running arbitrary code off the internet on your dev machine,

00:15:38 <v Michael Kennedy>and usually even on your servers.

00:15:41 <v Michael Kennedy>The thought alone makes me shudder, <v Michael Kennedy>and this doesn't even touch the reproducibility issues surrounding external packages.

00:15:47 <v Michael Kennedy>But there are tools to help.

00:15:49 <v Michael Kennedy>Posit Package Manager can solve both problems for you.

00:15:52 <v Michael Kennedy>Think of Posit Package Manager as your personal package concierge.

00:15:56 <v Michael Kennedy>You use it to build your own package repositories within your firewall that keep your project safe.

00:16:00 <v Michael Kennedy>You can upload your own internal packages to share or import packages directly from PyPI.

00:16:06 <v Michael Kennedy>Your team members can install from these repos in normal ways using tools like pip, Poetry, and uv.

00:16:12 <v Michael Kennedy>Posit Package Manager can help you manage updates, <v Michael Kennedy>ensuring you're using the latest,

00:16:17 <v Michael Kennedy>most secure versions of your packages.

00:16:19 <v Michael Kennedy>But it also takes point-in-time snapshots of your repos,

00:16:23 <v Michael Kennedy>which you can use to rerun your code <v Michael Kennedy>reproducibly in the future.

00:16:27 <v Michael Kennedy>Posit Package Manager reports on packages <v Michael Kennedy>with known CVEs and other vulnerabilities

00:16:31 <v Michael Kennedy>so you can keep ahead of threats.

00:16:34 <v Michael Kennedy>And if you need the highest level of security, <v Michael Kennedy>you can even run Posit Package Manager

00:16:38 <v Michael Kennedy>in air-gapped environments.

00:16:40 <v Michael Kennedy>If you work on a data science team <v Michael Kennedy>where security matters,

00:16:42 <v Michael Kennedy>You owe it to you and your org to check out Posit Package Manager.

00:16:46 <v Michael Kennedy>Visit talkpython.fm/ppm today and get a three-month free trial to see if it's a good fit.

00:16:52 <v Michael Kennedy>That's talkpython.fm/ppm.

00:16:55 <v Michael Kennedy>The link is in your podcast player's show notes.

00:16:57 <v Michael Kennedy>Thank you to Posit for supporting the show.

00:17:00 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>I still use Jupyter Notebooks, but one thing Marimo affords me,

00:17:04 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>because it's actually a.py file as well, you can convert them.

00:17:08 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>Well, they're essentially scripts as well.

00:17:09 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>So the notebook to production story is really interesting there.

00:17:13 <v Michael Kennedy>I think Marimo is super interesting.

00:17:16 <v Michael Kennedy>I think when I look at it, when I see people working with it or when I work with it, the

00:17:20 <v Michael Kennedy>limited extent to which I have, it just looks smooth and polished and modern.

00:17:26 <v Michael Kennedy>And I don't know, I just, when I use it, I feel, feel like it's something great.

00:17:29 <v Michael Kennedy>It also solves the problem that while JupyterNetbooks or JupyterNetbooks, JupyterLab, whatever,

00:17:35 <v Michael Kennedy>in general is like an incredible tool for data exploration and presenting data. It has this,

00:17:42 <v Michael Kennedy>this crazy implicit go-to sort of sequence, right? Like if you don't just go run all cells

00:17:48 <v Michael Kennedy>and you start bouncing around, you end up potentially running stuff out of order or

00:17:52 <v Michael Kennedy>skipping a step that would have made a different answer, the step below. And that's, that's real

00:17:56 <v Michael Kennedy>dangerous. And so Marimo uses the abstract syntax tree to look at dependencies across

00:18:02 <v Michael Kennedy>cells and make sure they run in order, which I think is an underappreciated benefit.

00:18:07 <v Michael Kennedy>It's like, oh, that's kind of nice.

00:18:08 <v Michael Kennedy>Like, no, like, do you want the wrong answer or the right answer?

00:18:11 <v Michael Kennedy>This is really important in data science and science in general.

00:18:14 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>You're right.

00:18:14 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>My understanding is it uses the AST to build a DAG of cells and execute some.

00:18:19 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>And what that means is, yeah, and it means you can't redefine something in a cell below,

00:18:24 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>but it'll give you a scratch pad to do so if you want to.

00:18:27 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>Now, I just want to say that's fantastic for a lot of cases.

00:18:30 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>There are cases when you just want to explore an experiment where Jupyter notebooks like

00:18:35 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>absolutely excel.

00:18:36 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>So it's not an either or here as well.

00:18:38 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>And I do want to say Jupyter notebooks, in all honesty, like get a bunch of hate for that.

00:18:43 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>And neither you nor I feel that way.

00:18:45 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>But I just want to be very explicit that that's not what we're saying here at all.

00:18:49 <v Michael Kennedy>Yeah, I have a lot of reverence for notebooks.

00:18:52 <v Michael Kennedy>Not only did they change the game for data science in general, but they changed it for

00:18:57 <v Michael Kennedy>Python.

00:18:58 <v Michael Kennedy>So if you look at the popularity and the people participating in Python,

00:19:02 <v Michael Kennedy>like one of its really powerful aspects is people are coming from all these different angles

00:19:06 <v Michael Kennedy>with different ideas and perspectives and different tools they want to build and so on.

00:19:10 <v Michael Kennedy>That's made it so rich.

00:19:11 <v Michael Kennedy>And that started basically in 2012 with the PyData stack with notebooks and all of that.

00:19:18 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>Yeah, I remember the first notebook I opened was called an IPython notebook,

00:19:22 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>not even a Jupyter notebook.

00:19:23 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>And of course, it's all based around an IPython also.

00:19:27 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>So we got to give a shout out to that.

00:19:28 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>And as I said, I was actually working biology in research at the time.

00:19:32 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>And in biology, we have notebooks, right?

00:19:35 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>Like you write, you put your PCR gel, you put your figures there, you write things.

00:19:39 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>This idea of literate programming is exactly that.

00:19:42 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>And what it does is it brings experimentation.

00:19:45 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>It brings scientific rigor and scientific research into computation.

00:19:49 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>And very important for this space where we are, really what we're talking about in data

00:19:53 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>science, ML, AI is the convergence of software meeting data and experimentation. So we need new

00:19:59 <v Michael Kennedy>tools for this. And notebooks are one of the most awesome examples of that. Okay. I took us down a

00:20:05 <v Michael Kennedy>bit of a hole with the Marimo stuff because it is cool. Anything else that jumps out to you? I have

00:20:10 <v Michael Kennedy>one at the end that I want to riff on before we get off this topic, but what else jumps out to you?

00:20:14 <v Michael Kennedy>Schools 2024, 2025, that's kind of like, oh, that's different. To step back a bit, we are talking

00:20:19 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>about like data science with AI and that type of stuff. And this works both ways, right? Like data

00:20:24 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>science plays into AI and building with foundation models, but I'd have to fire myself if I didn't

00:20:30 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>talk about the other way, which is AI helping us do data science. And the tools are AI assisted.

00:20:37 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>The biggest tool is AI assisted programming for data science, which is revolutionary. I think

00:20:44 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>maybe isn't even as big a term as we need for this. Absolutely groundbreaking.

00:20:48 <v Michael Kennedy>It's easy to get frustrated saying it's bad for the environment.

00:20:52 <v Michael Kennedy>I'm a good data science, good developer.

00:20:54 <v Michael Kennedy>I don't need this stuff.

00:20:55 <v Michael Kennedy>But for the most part, I feel like the cat is out of the bag.

00:20:58 <v Michael Kennedy>The Pandora's box is open, whatever analogy you want to use here.

00:21:01 <v Michael Kennedy>And it's made such a difference.

00:21:03 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>Without a doubt.

00:21:03 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>And I definitely agree on climate concerns.

00:21:05 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>We should be having larger conversations around this.

00:21:07 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>You can start using smaller models and local models for AI-assisted programming.

00:21:11 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>They won't superpower you as much.

00:21:13 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>there are, you know, to say all, and this is to say all of AI is very bad for the climate is,

00:21:19 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>I suppose, like saying both hummers and electric cars in the same bucket, right? So, but I totally

00:21:25 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>agree that that's a concern we need. And the other thing though, man, if we're talking about like,

00:21:31 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>you know, software's writing the software, AI's writing the software, vibe coding, I don't

00:21:35 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>necessarily understand it. Guess what? We were all copy and pasting from Stack Overflow. We've

00:21:39 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>been doing that for a long time, right? And I don't necessarily understand all that code. So

00:21:43 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>in some ways scaling and superpowering that behavior.

00:21:47 <v Michael Kennedy>It's on you.

00:21:48 <v Michael Kennedy>It's on me.

00:21:48 <v Michael Kennedy>It's on everyone who uses it to either, and we're going to get into this more in detail

00:21:53 <v Michael Kennedy>later, use that as a learning experience or as a, well, I don't need to know that.

00:21:58 <v Michael Kennedy>I'll just, whatever it says, right?

00:22:00 <v Michael Kennedy>That was true with Stack Overflow as well.

00:22:02 <v Michael Kennedy>Like you would go to Stack Overflow and you would just copy something.

00:22:05 <v Michael Kennedy>And the knock on people who would take stuff from Stack Overflow and paste it was they

00:22:09 <v Michael Kennedy>had no idea what it meant.

00:22:11 <v Michael Kennedy>They just saw that it solved the problem.

00:22:12 <v Michael Kennedy>there was even that joke keyboard that Stack Overflow created. All it had was like a control

00:22:17 <v Michael Kennedy>and a C and a V and they had a Stack Overflow logo. It's like, this is all you need, right?

00:22:21 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>It was hilarious, right? I'd like to system prompt ChatGBT to not be so sycophantic

00:22:26 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>and treat me like people on Stack Overflow used to treat people sometimes as well.

00:22:29 <v Michael Kennedy>My ego is doing way too well today. I need to be beat down. But the thing is like,

00:22:33 <v Michael Kennedy>you could go to Stack Overflow and you could go, wow, okay, I didn't know that. And then you learn

00:22:37 <v Michael Kennedy>it and you don't need to go back to Stack Overflow and copy that thing because now you've understood

00:22:41 <v Michael Kennedy>something deep and that's different that's on you when you're copying my stack overflow and it's

00:22:46 <v Michael Kennedy>it's on you a hundred times over if you use these tools right because a lot of times especially the

00:22:51 <v Michael Kennedy>agentic stuff it explains what it does like here's what it was here's why i changed it it could let

00:22:56 <v Michael Kennedy>that scroll by or you can go slow and study it and become smarter not more brain dead you know what

00:23:01 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>i mean if i was getting like pandas or scikit-learn code from stack overflow i'd really like

00:23:06 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>want to understand it because that was my bread and butter whereas if it was front end stuff

00:23:11 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>Like I'd probably go and find the same issue question time and time again.

00:23:16 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>Same with like environment stuff, like getting environments working in Jupyter notebooks or

00:23:21 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>something.

00:23:21 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>I just, I still can't grok that stuff.

00:23:23 <v Michael Kennedy>I know.

00:23:23 <v Michael Kennedy>I was just thinking of bash scripts, like shell scripts.

00:23:27 <v Michael Kennedy>I'm like, you know what?

00:23:28 <v Michael Kennedy>This is just, I don't need to, I don't need to remember this.

00:23:30 <v Michael Kennedy>I just bookmark that puppy.

00:23:31 <v Michael Kennedy>And long as it doesn't have RMRF or something destructive in it, I'm just right.

00:23:36 <v Michael Kennedy>Incredible.

00:23:37 <v Michael Kennedy>Okay, one more thing before we move on to like the AI depths that I think is, we got to talk about it.

00:23:43 <v Michael Kennedy>Because today is October 7th, 2025, as we record this, not as I release it.

00:23:47 <v Michael Kennedy>So I'll have to be a bit nostalgic for a few weeks.

00:23:50 <v Michael Kennedy>But today is Python Pi Day.

00:23:53 <v Michael Kennedy>Python 3.14 came out today, right?

00:23:56 <v Michael Kennedy>And one of the main features of Python 3.14 is the free threaded aspect being sort of officially taken in.

00:24:03 <v Michael Kennedy>And I know one of the big challenges that's been solved with C extensions and Rust and other stuff, but it's still a bit of a challenge is like, I've got a ton of data.

00:24:10 <v Michael Kennedy>I want to process it in my codes in Python.

00:24:12 <v Michael Kennedy>How do I take advantage of the 32 cores I got?

00:24:15 <v Michael Kennedy>Or do I get one 32nd of a computer, right?

00:24:18 <v Michael Kennedy>And so I think starting to think about parallel programming a little bit, it's going to take on whatever significance it takes, it's going to take on more than it has traditionally.

00:24:26 <v Michael Kennedy>Totally agree.

00:24:27 <v Michael Kennedy>And I think it's the data scientists who are going to need it more than anyone.

00:24:30 <v Michael Kennedy>Yeah.

00:24:31 <v Michael Kennedy>Our web frameworks handle that kind of stuff for us.

00:24:33 <v Michael Kennedy>They fan that out into processes and other things.

00:24:36 <v Michael Kennedy>But when you've got real computational stuff, there's no IO blocking that you can work around,

00:24:42 <v Michael Kennedy>right, to leverage async, right?

00:24:43 <v Michael Kennedy>You've got to do the CPU stuff.

00:24:45 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>Exactly.

00:24:46 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>And it's a really good question because I would have a trillion percent agreed with you.

00:24:51 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>And I 100%, but I would have a trillion percent agreed with you pre our chat GBT moment when

00:24:57 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>data scientists, ML engineers, all of these types of people weren't only building products,

00:25:02 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>serving models, that type of stuff, but they were responsible for training as well.

00:25:06 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>And I think you're totally right with large-scale analytics. Think about Dask and geospatial,

00:25:12 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>large-scale, multidimensional, geospatial, atmospheric data, these types of things,

00:25:17 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>and basic analytics. I'm not even talking about machine learning there, but we have entered

00:25:21 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>a regime now where you can build ml and ai powered products by pinging apis or hosting your own models

00:25:29 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>and that type of stuff whether it's hugging face from hugging face or wherever it may be

00:25:33 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>or you know using olama locally and in that case i think because you're not doing the training

00:25:39 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>yourself you're able to do a lot of things without requiring massive massive compute yeah there is a

00:25:44 <v Michael Kennedy>bit of a it seems like a big area but it's a bit of a thin area because you've got the regular

00:25:49 <v Michael Kennedy>programming you can do then you need that async you need that parallelism for higher compute but

00:25:54 <v Michael Kennedy>just you don't go very far until someone says fine i'm doing it in rust i'm doing a C++ or it's an

00:25:59 <v Michael Kennedy>api and then you don't need it again you know what i mean there's like a little stratosphere sort of

00:26:04 <v Michael Kennedy>bit of it and happy python pi day yes happy python pi day that's pretty cool i've not even installed

00:26:09 <v Michael Kennedy>it yet today because uv has not shipped their support for it yet and that's when i mentioned

00:26:15 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>new modern tools like marimo and polars and duck db uv has has to be in there as well also very

00:26:22 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>excited about other package management but plus plus for lack of a better term tools like

00:26:27 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>pixie that uh wolf olprecht and his his team who i know have been on the show and you know who

00:26:33 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>people may know from mamba which helped us with conda so much so uv is not the only only story

00:26:39 <v Michael Kennedy>out there solving these working to solve these problems i do think it's really interesting

00:26:42 <v Michael Kennedy>especially for the data science crowd, because things have gotten better for those of us that

00:26:47 <v Michael Kennedy>use pip exclusively. It's like faster, a little bit better resolution, a little bit better workflow.

00:26:53 <v Michael Kennedy>Like some of the tools are brought together, like pip-tools plus just regular pip. But I think it's

00:26:58 <v Michael Kennedy>a bigger consideration for your side of the fence in that there's Conda. And now do you stick with

00:27:03 <v Michael Kennedy>Conda or do you use UV? Like that's, they kind of compete more than pip did with uv, I think,

00:27:08 <v Michael Kennedy>actually. I use uv. I agree. I think uv is pushed it over the edge. And then the pyx

00:27:12 <v Michael Kennedy>that charlie's released if you're like an org where they help with building like the layers of

00:27:17 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>machine models and pytorch and stuff is it's pretty interesting i also just want to say on python pi

00:27:22 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>day that is so geeky and i i would want to i do want to say show my geeky t-shirt to everyone which

00:27:28 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>says schrodinger's cat wanted dead and alive it's a wanted poster so speaking of geeky stuff that's

00:27:33 <v Michael Kennedy>perfect that's perfect i i just have a sweater i'm sorry i didn't i didn't prepare yeah that's true

00:27:38 <v Michael Kennedy>i'm in a library it's full of books so i can i'm sure something geeky is behind me all right so

00:27:42 <v Michael Kennedy>We've talked about maybe some of the other not so necessarily AI focused tools is like what people should focus on.

00:27:49 <v Michael Kennedy>But like we both said, it's so transformative.

00:27:52 <v Michael Kennedy>And if people haven't actually tried it and seen it in action, you got to see it to believe it.

00:27:56 <v Michael Kennedy>Because I was a skeptic until my friend's like, no, let's sit down and let me show you.

00:27:59 <v Michael Kennedy>I'm like, oh, OK, I get it.

00:28:02 <v Michael Kennedy>And so let's talk about some of the AI tools.

00:28:04 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>I've done an initial slicing into different levels, which may be useful thinking through the evolution of these tools.

00:28:10 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>And how do we use AI to help us code?

00:28:13 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>And I jokingly level zero because we zero index here is copy and pasting from Stack Overflow.

00:28:20 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>Right now, that's not quite using AI, but it is AI is using collective wisdom as opposed

00:28:24 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>to stuff in yourself.

00:28:25 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>Right.

00:28:26 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>So we've got that.

00:28:27 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>Okay.

00:28:28 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>But then after our chat GBT moment, we've people started copy instead of copying and pasting

00:28:34 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>between Stack Overflow and their IDE, VS Code, Jupyter Notebooks, whatever it may be.

00:28:38 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>people started copy and pasting between ChatGPT and the IDE.

00:28:43 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>So you would, you know, let's say you get an error message from your IDE,

00:28:47 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>copy it into ChatGPT, give it a bit more context, whatever it may be.

00:28:50 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>And then such as, you know, give it the code you wrote,

00:28:53 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>plus the error message, plus your environment.

00:28:56 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>And it will be pretty good at helping you, <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>depending on what packages you're using, what framework.

00:29:01 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>If you're working in PyData, absolutely fantastic, right?

00:29:05 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>Of course, it's trained on scikit-learn.

00:29:07 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>It's trained on MapLotlib.

00:29:08 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>It's trained on Seaborn.

00:29:09 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>It's trained on spaCy.

00:29:10 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>One of the biggest frustrations at that point was it wasn't trained on ChatGPT's current

00:29:16 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>API.

00:29:16 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>So it would always give you, even if you corrected it, it would always revert to previous OpenAI

00:29:23 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>API.

00:29:23 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>Okay.

00:29:24 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>So level one, copy and pasting.

00:29:26 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>Level two, code completion in IDE.

00:29:28 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>So you can think co-pilot or whatever.

00:29:30 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>You're writing code and it will start suggesting things, right?

00:29:33 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>So that's just working your IDE.

00:29:35 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>Now, I think these things people probably know about.

00:29:38 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>But then level three is where things get really wild for me, where you actually, you have an

00:29:42 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>agent in your IDE or your terminal.

00:29:45 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>So cursor, which is a VS CodeFork, has an agent and a chat in it where you can have an

00:29:51 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>empty repository and say, hey, I want you to write a program that creates a RAG pipeline

00:30:00 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>over the documents in this subdirectory or something like that.

00:30:04 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>And it will go and do that immediately.

00:30:06 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>It will be, when you do that, it won't be great.

00:30:09 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>It'll do all types of nonsense.

00:30:10 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>It might write lots of directories and subdirectories.

00:30:13 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>So we can talk about some of the gotchas, <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>but this is agentic coding where you're chatting

00:30:19 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>and it just throws stuff in.

00:30:21 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>I will also add, <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>and this is something we mentioned briefly beforehand.

00:30:24 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>I don't like typing that much, to be honest.

00:30:26 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>So I use Super Whisper.

00:30:28 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>There are other tools to do this where I dictate to it.

00:30:31 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>And I also have a stream deck, <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>which is what we mentioned beforehand, which a lot of content creators use this. It's like buttons

00:30:39 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>and knobs that you can assign to macros. And so when I have a button that opens cursor, puts it in

00:30:45 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>agent mode, attaches Claude, Sonnet 4.5 or Gemma 2.5, whatever it may be. Exactly. That's a stream

00:30:52 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>deck. And then I have accept code buttons and reject code and that type of stuff. So I can

00:30:57 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>actually build a not insignificant amount of software with my voice and three buttons,

00:31:02 <v Michael Kennedy>which is so powerful.

00:31:04 <v Michael Kennedy>I also find that if I do dictation, <v Michael Kennedy>I can be a lot more patient and thorough

00:31:09 <v Michael Kennedy>in a lot of ways, right?

00:31:10 <v Michael Kennedy>Like I don't know about you, <v Michael Kennedy>but I've had like RSI issues.

00:31:13 <v Michael Kennedy>So I got to be real cognizant <v Michael Kennedy>of like how much typing I do.

00:31:17 <v Michael Kennedy>I've got my Microsoft Sculpt ergonomic keyboard <v Michael Kennedy>that I drag with me everywhere

00:31:21 <v Michael Kennedy>because square keyboards will destroy me in like a week.

00:31:24 <v Michael Kennedy>And so it lets me go on without worrying <v Michael Kennedy>about those kinds of things.

00:31:27 <v Michael Kennedy>I use a Mac Whisper, <v Michael Kennedy>but it's super similar, I believe, right?

00:31:31 <v Michael Kennedy>It just uses the same underlying engine.

00:31:33 <v Michael Kennedy>And it's really nice that you can, I do it for email.

00:31:36 <v Michael Kennedy>I do it for lots of things.

00:31:37 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>I'll just give that.

00:31:38 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>I love how you mentioned it does help one be more patient because yeah, when typing, well,

00:31:42 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>when chatting with an AI, you can get frustrated and the friction in typing and correcting yourself

00:31:47 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>and that type of stuff, you just don't have when speaking natural language.

00:31:51 <v Michael Kennedy>Yeah.

00:31:51 <v Michael Kennedy>And I find people, I don't, I mean, this is not scientific, but my experience has been

00:31:55 <v Michael Kennedy>that people say like, oh, this stuff is not good.

00:31:57 <v Michael Kennedy>it always just gives me junk results and so on, is so often there's not enough information given.

00:32:03 <v Michael Kennedy>It'd be like, create me a graph, not use Plotly to create this type of graph with this type of

00:32:09 <v Michael Kennedy>focus from this data like I did before. You know what I mean? Those are really different things.

00:32:14 <v Michael Kennedy>And the more specificity you can give these tools, the better. I use a lot of AI stuff.

00:32:20 <v Michael Kennedy>And I would say I have plenty of prompts that are pages long. And I was like, here's a file,

00:32:26 <v Michael Kennedy>Here's four pages of what I want you to do with it.

00:32:28 <v Michael Kennedy>Let's go.

00:32:29 <v Michael Kennedy>And it is not always writing.

00:32:30 <v Michael Kennedy>So but incredible results compared to what if you just say, you know, analyze this or whatever.

00:32:34 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>We'll get to this when we talk about gotchas.

00:32:36 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>But having a conversation with your system before getting it to write anything is incredibly important and productive.

00:32:46 <v Michael Kennedy>This portion of Talk Python To Me is brought to you by NordStellar.

00:32:49 <v Michael Kennedy>NordStellar is a threat exposure management platform from the Nord security family,

00:32:54 <v Michael Kennedy>the folks behind NordVPN that combines dark web intelligence, session hijacking prevention,

00:32:59 <v Michael Kennedy>brand and abuse detection, and external attack service management. Keeping your team and your

00:33:04 <v Michael Kennedy>company secure is a daunting challenge. That's why you need NordStellar on your side. It's a

00:33:10 <v Michael Kennedy>comprehensive set of services, monitoring, and alerts to limit your exposure to breaches and

00:33:16 <v Michael Kennedy>attacks and act instantly if something does happen. Here's how it works. NordStellar detects

00:33:21 <v Michael Kennedy>compromised employee and consumer credentials. It detects stolen authentication cookies found in

00:33:27 <v Michael Kennedy>InfoSteeler logs and dark web sources, then revokes live sessions and flags compromised devices,

00:33:34 <v Michael Kennedy>reducing MFA bypass ATOs without extra code in your app. Nordstellar scans the dark web for

00:33:40 <v Michael Kennedy>cyber threats targeting your company. It monitors forums, markets, ransomware blogs, and over 25,000

00:33:47 <v Michael Kennedy>cybercrime telegram channels with alerting and searchable context you can route to Slack or your

00:33:53 <v Michael Kennedy>IRR tool. Nordstellar adds brand and domain protection. It detects cyber squats and lookalikes

00:33:59 <v Michael Kennedy>via visual, content similarity, and search transparency logs, plus broader brand abuse

00:34:05 <v Michael Kennedy>takedowns across the web, social, and app stores to cut the phishing risk for your users. They

00:34:11 <v Michael Kennedy>don't just alert you about impersonation, they file and manage the removals. Finally, Nordstellar

00:34:16 <v Michael Kennedy>is developer-friendly.

00:34:17 <v Michael Kennedy>It's available as a platform and API <v Michael Kennedy>with integrations for Splunk,

00:34:21 <v Michael Kennedy>QRadar, Datadog, Sentinel, <v Michael Kennedy>Elastic, and Cortex.

00:34:24 <v Michael Kennedy>No agents to install.

00:34:25 <v Michael Kennedy>If security is important to you <v Michael Kennedy>and your organization,

00:34:28 <v Michael Kennedy>check out Nordstellar.

00:34:29 <v Michael Kennedy>Visit talkpython.fm/nordstellar.

00:34:31 <v Michael Kennedy>The link is in your podcast player's <v Michael Kennedy>show notes and on the episode page.

00:34:35 <v Michael Kennedy>Please use our link, <v Michael Kennedy>talkpython.fm/nordstellar,

00:34:38 <v Michael Kennedy>so that they know that you heard <v Michael Kennedy>about their service from us.

00:34:41 <v Michael Kennedy>Thank you to the whole <v Michael Kennedy>Nord security team

00:34:44 <v Michael Kennedy>for supporting Talk Python To Me.

00:34:46 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>Isaac Flath, who he has a wonderful course on Maven called Elite AI Assisted Coding,

00:34:51 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>which I'm actually starting as a student this week. And I may give a guest talk there. He wrote,

00:34:55 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>I don't know whether he came up with it, but it's, it's, he calls it Socratic and dialogue

00:34:59 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>driven development where you essentially pair program with the AI. Don't expect it to do

00:35:03 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>everything, but have, have conversations. So the other thing is a lot of these agentic systems like

00:35:08 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>cursor, which I use daily, probably a bit too much. You can plug into any, you know, state of the art

00:35:15 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>API. So, you know, Sonnet 4.5 came out recently and the day after you could use that in Cursor.

00:35:20 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>Gemini 2.5 came out a while ago, then you couldn't plug it in. GPT-5 and so on. The other thing I

00:35:26 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>just wanted to give a shout out to is Continue. Tyler Dunn, speaking of modern tools and open

00:35:31 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>source tools, it's like an open source cursor of sorts. And I mean, he wouldn't frame it that way,

00:35:37 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>but you can have all your own local models, data preserving, privacy preserving, and use those in

00:35:42 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>in this way. So just going back to this slicing though, level one, copy and paste code, level two,

00:35:48 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>code completion, level three agents in an IDE or terminal. So Claude code, for example, can be in

00:35:54 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>your terminal, cursor, VS Code, fork. Level four is embedded in other tools like Slack or Discord or

00:36:01 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>email. You can tag cursor in Slack to, if you notice a documentation fault, you can tag it in

00:36:07 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>Slack to fix that.

00:36:10 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>Manus, you can tag in email threads now.

00:36:13 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>Level five is more proactive.

00:36:15 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>So all of these are reactive systems.

00:36:17 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>Level five is more proactive.

00:36:19 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>So you can have Cursor, for example, <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>and a lot of these systems,

00:36:21 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>I just use Cursor the most, <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>to do code review in CI,

00:36:24 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>in continuous integration.

00:36:26 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>So whenever I submit a PR, <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>Cursor can come in and do a code review there.

00:36:31 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>Now I'm getting a bit to future music.

00:36:33 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>At level six, we've got async or background agents

00:36:36 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>that just do stuff in the background, essentially,

00:36:39 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>which we're going to see a lot more of.

00:36:41 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>And then level seven, <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>which we haven't seen so much proactive agents.

00:36:45 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>And I think these are going to be huge <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>that will just notice stuff happening in production.

00:36:49 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>Like, hey, we have this outlier here.

00:36:51 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>Oh, this didn't quite work.

00:36:53 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>Or agents that come to me on a Monday morning <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>and be like, hey, check this out.

00:36:57 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>Check that out.

00:36:57 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>Check that.

00:36:58 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>Like a good colleague, right?

00:37:01 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>A team member.

00:37:02 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>Yeah.

00:37:02 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>So, but we're already at, you know, level five and kind of got background agents as well.

00:37:08 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>So we're getting, yeah, to a lot of really exciting places.

00:37:13 <v Michael Kennedy>Yeah.

00:37:13 <v Michael Kennedy>So I'm a hundred percent bought in up to level four, probably like certainly the agent decoding

00:37:19 <v Michael Kennedy>a little bit of the code review, not so much in CI, but like looking at the stuff that

00:37:22 <v Michael Kennedy>I'm, I might ask it like, Hey, what's going on here?

00:37:25 <v Michael Kennedy>Why is it like this background agents?

00:37:27 <v Michael Kennedy>I just haven't, I haven't got there.

00:37:29 <v Michael Kennedy>They seem, they seem like they don't have enough to work with, right?

00:37:32 <v Michael Kennedy>they don't have my whole machine and all the setups and all the things they need. But I can

00:37:36 <v Michael Kennedy>see how they would be useful. Certainly the way you're describing like a good colleague.

00:37:39 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>And so one example is not necessarily in software, but background agents, and I haven't done this,

00:37:44 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>but I've got friends and colleagues who've built background agents that monitor their inbox and

00:37:48 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>will ping them like their email, sorry, and will cluster emails and be like, hey, you really should

00:37:53 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>reply to this one. This is a prospect or a client that really needs your attention right now.

00:37:57 <v Michael Kennedy>I think that kind of stuff would be really neat. I will throw out there now, this comes from

00:38:00 <v Michael Kennedy>Sentry, who is a sponsor of the show, just to be fair, but I'm not doing this because they

00:38:04 <v Michael Kennedy>sponsored it. They added this thing called Seer, S-E-E-R, that when your app collects an exception

00:38:10 <v Michael Kennedy>or something or doesn't collect it and it gets up there, depending on how you send it up there,

00:38:15 <v Michael Kennedy>is it'll apply AI to whatever it receives. And it'll look, if you bind it to your GitHub and so

00:38:19 <v Michael Kennedy>on, it'll like try to understand the project. And maybe by the time you get to look at the bug

00:38:25 <v Michael Kennedy>report, it actually has a solution suggested as well, which, and it'll do a PR, which that's on

00:38:30 <v Michael Kennedy>the verge of what you were suggesting as this sort of like proactive buddy that's just hanging out

00:38:34 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>there. As I said, I do want to mention just a few gotchas. Or actually, let me just say some of the

00:38:40 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>really powerful use cases in data science, since we are talking about foundation models for data

00:38:45 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>science, just writing code. I mean, text to seek all these LLMs are trained on now, right? So

00:38:52 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>writing SQL code based on what you say or what you type in natural language. Now, chat with it

00:38:57 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>beforehand so that you make sure it understands your schema. It may not be great at complex joins,

00:39:03 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>this type of stuff. Understand the system you're working with, get a feel for how it works.

00:39:07 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>Actually think of it as like a super excited ADHD-esque, perhaps slightly autistic as well.

00:39:14 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>And I mean that with all the love in terms of, you know, absolute like deep memory, be able to recall

00:39:19 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>a lot of information. And on the ADHD spectrum, in terms of just how it will do, like it will spread

00:39:26 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>its attention over a lot of different places and create lots of different stuff, some of which may

00:39:30 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>not work, but some of which will be incredible. So have empathy for your system in that sense,

00:39:34 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>but writing SQL code, amazing. PyDataStack, incredible. I want to run an idea by you and

00:39:39 <v Michael Kennedy>just see what you think here with what you just said with like, think of it as this super excited,

00:39:44 <v Michael Kennedy>somewhat scatterbrain, junior helper, excited friend. If you had hired somebody, even if they

00:39:50 <v Michael Kennedy>went to Stanford, but they hadn't really done work on any like major data science projects,

00:39:54 <v Michael Kennedy>and they came to your company and you gave them a job,

00:39:57 <v Michael Kennedy>would you expect 100%, like absolutely 100% correctness?

00:40:00 <v Michael Kennedy>And they're, no.

00:40:01 <v Michael Kennedy>So I don't know why people expect the AI to be literally 100%.

00:40:05 <v Michael Kennedy>I think I have an idea why, <v Michael Kennedy>but expecting the AI to be 100% right,

00:40:10 <v Michael Kennedy>where it's kind of doing some of this human level type of reason.

00:40:13 <v Michael Kennedy>I mean, not thinking, I'm not saying that, <v Michael Kennedy>but this kind of problem, this creative problem solving,

00:40:18 <v Michael Kennedy>we should have a little bit of patience for if it gets it wrong,

00:40:21 <v Michael Kennedy>especially if we give it poor directions.

00:40:23 <v Michael Kennedy>You know what I mean?

00:40:23 <v Michael Kennedy>And I just feel like people so often think, well, it's a computer and it's wrong, so it's trash.

00:40:29 <v Michael Kennedy>It's no good.

00:40:29 <v Michael Kennedy>Well, was it 95% right?

00:40:31 <v Michael Kennedy>Because that's really helpful.

00:40:32 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>This is so important.

00:40:33 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>And there are several things in there.

00:40:34 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>Firstly, I think when after our chat champion moment, Jeremy Howard noticed a complaint that people were like, oh, I need to chat with it like it doesn't do the thing the first time and I need to correct it.

00:40:44 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>And Jeremy was like, what type of human don't you need to have a conversation with to learn stuff?

00:40:48 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>The other thing is in nearly all of these systems now, you have memory.

00:40:54 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>And cursor, for example, has cursor rules.

00:40:55 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>Whereas if you notice stuff that it does or doesn't do, put it in the rules.

00:40:59 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>You can have project-specific rules.

00:41:01 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>You can have cursor general rules, this type of stuff.

00:41:04 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>Such as always explain your reasoning.

00:41:06 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>And to your point, I don't think these things think, but they mimic reasoning and thought

00:41:10 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>in pretty sophisticated ways.

00:41:12 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>So I totally agree with that.

00:41:14 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>Also, use these things to not only write code, but to write tests for code producers, right?

00:41:21 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>To debug, to add assertions.

00:41:24 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>Now, also make sure you're always reading the code on average that it writes.

00:41:30 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>If things are really important, it's about your appetite for risk.

00:41:32 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>Maybe if things are really important, make sure you know what the code does and read it.

00:41:37 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>If things aren't as important, maybe you don't need to.

00:41:40 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>And an example I'll give there is one of the biggest wins here is being able to vibe code your own data viewers.

00:41:47 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>So let's say I'm building.

00:41:48 <v Michael Kennedy>100% I agree with you on this.

00:41:50 <v Michael Kennedy>Incredible, right?

00:41:51 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>So if I'm building an LLM powered app where, okay, building an LLM powered app and I've got all these conversations, I can build a vibe code, a custom, a bespoke custom viewer to view that.

00:42:02 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>If it's an agent that writes emails, I can even build a viewer that displays the conversations

00:42:08 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>as emails or whatever it may be, right?

00:42:10 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>Now, I need to make sure that it's displaying the correct information.

00:42:14 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>So I need to make sure that my traces are actually looking correct.

00:42:18 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>So I need to understand that code.

00:42:20 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>But the ins and outs of the front end it's building, not the biggest deal for me.

00:42:24 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>So figure out what's important and what isn't.

00:42:26 <v Michael Kennedy>There's so many tools like this that are like, it's not me worth taking a week to write that.

00:42:31 <v Michael Kennedy>But wouldn't it be cool if I had that?

00:42:33 <v Michael Kennedy>And nothing depends on it.

00:42:34 <v Michael Kennedy>It's kind of like its own side little utility.

00:42:37 <v Michael Kennedy>There's no, it's not a building block <v Michael Kennedy>that's going to become an important foundational thing.

00:42:41 <v Michael Kennedy>It just, if it works, you're like, that's awesome.

00:42:43 <v Michael Kennedy>I have that.

00:42:44 <v Michael Kennedy>People got to take advantage of just going like, <v Michael Kennedy>oh, I need a utility that does X

00:42:49 <v Michael Kennedy>or I need a view in our admin section of the web app <v Michael Kennedy>that does this.

00:42:53 <v Michael Kennedy>Nothing depends on it.

00:42:54 <v Michael Kennedy>If it works, amazing.

00:42:55 <v Michael Kennedy>If it doesn't, well, it didn't exist anyway.

00:42:57 <v Michael Kennedy>So whatever.

00:42:59 <v Michael Kennedy>And there's so many opportunities.

00:43:01 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>I love this so much. And I want to take a slight detour because it's so important. I actually think the surface area of what software is, is expanding and changing completely. So let's just look at, take a bit of a sociological big picture look at history where software, classically, you've, has been very expensive to build, right?

00:43:22 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>You've needed to pay a lot of not inexpensive engineers to build out a sophisticated product.

00:43:29 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>For that reason, you've had to get a lot of demand.

00:43:32 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>You've had to have a lot of service area of the market.

00:43:34 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>What that's meant is that you've needed to cover a lot of edge cases to satisfy a large

00:43:41 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>market so that you can make revenue based on the costs that you're accruing, right?

00:43:45 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>Now, with the ability to even vibe code or use AI-assisted coding to build this type

00:43:52 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>stuff, it changes what we can build and what it needs, what type of people it needs to satisfy.

00:43:58 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>So that's why the conversation of like vibe coding is going to bury Salesforce or SaaS versus like

00:44:04 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>old men screaming at clouds, vibe coding sucks or whatever it is, misses the entire middle ground

00:44:10 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>of the types of things that are possible. And I do think internal products, such as we've talked

00:44:15 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>about data viewers, internal products, such as, you know, lots of companies are ripping out their

00:44:20 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>marketing automation stacks and building things internally through to, I mean, I've got a friend

00:44:26 <v Michael Kennedy>who built a chess tutor app. I mean, it's not chess.com, but like a hundred of his friends

00:44:32 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>use it, right? So the idea of the different types of software we can build now and thinking about,

00:44:38 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>you know, ephemeral software or just in time software, disposable software, fast software

00:44:44 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>that we can build to solve a problem right now and then move on. I think we need to shift our

00:44:48 <v Michael Kennedy>model of what software actually is. I 100% agree. And it's such an exciting time. I also think this

00:44:55 <v Michael Kennedy>actually has an implication for IPI packages and a lot of these just external packages. So think

00:45:01 <v Michael Kennedy>about the ones you use, like this is not going to happen for pandas or polars or Jupyter or

00:45:05 <v Michael Kennedy>something like that. But how often have you gone like, oh, I need, I need a package that will let

00:45:12 <v Michael Kennedy>me look up both my ipv4 and ipv6 ip address and you you'd make you take that as a dependency

00:45:19 <v Michael Kennedy>that's like one fun using one function out of whatever thing you grab that might give you that

00:45:23 <v Michael Kennedy>information and there's there's a lot more opportunity to have fewer building blocks and

00:45:28 <v Michael Kennedy>dependencies that you need in your application if you can just say hey agent thing i need this and

00:45:34 <v Michael Kennedy>put it in its own file and boom and now you're not dependent on well did that thing upgrade to

00:45:38 <v Michael Kennedy>Python 3.15, sorry, you're stuck. It didn't. You know what I mean? Like it's, you were sort of free

00:45:44 <v Michael Kennedy>from, from these like little weird, I depend on this whole tree of dependencies because I need

00:45:50 <v Michael Kennedy>one little piece of functionality. You can vendor in stuff a lot easier if it's a low stakes.

00:45:54 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>The other thing that I think AI assisted coding help I've seen help with is,  now this is,

00:45:59 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>this will be a bit controversial, but it's going from prototype to production. And what I really

00:46:03 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>mean by that? Let's say your production stack is in like Databricks, Spark, whatever. You can

00:46:08 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>prototype, write your pandas code. And then because once again, Spark, Databricks, all that documentation

00:46:14 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>is in training data. You can then convert it relatively easily. But of course, read, test your

00:46:18 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>code that you're pushing to prod just as you would with a junior software engineer, right?

00:46:24 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>The other thing is some gotchas with this. It'll do lots of things you don't ask it to do, okay?

00:46:30 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>such as it will just start downloading packages, for example,

00:46:35 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>if you're trying to write some code, right?

00:46:37 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>And so it'll do lots of things you don't ask it to do,

00:46:40 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>and it will also do things you ask it to not do, right?

00:46:44 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>So you'll say only write in one file, <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>and Devon, for example, will create nested subdirectories

00:46:51 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>each with 15 notebooks, something like that.

00:46:54 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>It will also forget lots of things in your conversation.

00:46:58 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>So make sure to remind it of things.

00:47:02 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>It will do something called dead looping.

00:47:04 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>And this is one of the most frustrating and pernicious things, depending on how long the

00:47:07 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>loop is.

00:47:08 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>But it will try to solve your most recent concern.

00:47:11 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>It will really optimize locally around the conversation.

00:47:15 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>And so it will solve that.

00:47:16 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>Then another error will appear and it will solve that.

00:47:18 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>And it will another error appear.

00:47:20 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>It will solve that.

00:47:21 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>And after a while, it might actually go back to the initial state.

00:47:24 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>So that's what dead looping is.

00:47:25 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>And this can be a loop of three.

00:47:26 <v Michael Kennedy>And it just cycles.

00:47:27 <v Michael Kennedy>Yeah.

00:47:27 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>five, seven, nine. So be very careful about that. Solutions are get it to zoom out. Say, hey,

00:47:33 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>let's zoom out and have a holistic conversation about this. Now, this is wild that this is how

00:47:37 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>we're interacting with software as well. Now, this is part of the- It's science fiction.

00:47:41 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>It really is. Science fiction. But write product requirement drops with it before any code. Now,

00:47:46 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>it may still just start writing code, even when you tell it to do that, right? Plan with it.

00:47:50 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>Write rules. Have empathy for your super excited, bright, fast, forgetful intern.

00:47:57 <v Michael Kennedy>I've really embraced this plan thing.

00:47:59 <v Michael Kennedy>All my major projects have a plans folder.

00:48:01 <v Michael Kennedy>And every time I start, I create a markdown file.

00:48:04 <v Michael Kennedy>I say, we're going to plan it out.

00:48:06 <v Michael Kennedy>And I want you to write in this markdown file what we're going to do.

00:48:09 <v Michael Kennedy>And I'll do that with a really expensive model, you know, like a thinking

00:48:12 <v Michael Kennedy>something or whatever, and it'll do it.

00:48:14 <v Michael Kennedy>Then I'll switch.

00:48:15 <v Michael Kennedy>I'll completely throw away that chat.

00:48:16 <v Michael Kennedy>Get another one, a little lower model.

00:48:18 <v Michael Kennedy>Say, we're going to do phase one of this plan.

00:48:19 <v Michael Kennedy>Let's go.

00:48:20 <v Michael Kennedy>And then two and then three.

00:48:21 <v Michael Kennedy>And every time I say, when you're done, you update the plan.

00:48:24 <v Michael Kennedy>So you know where we are and what we've done.

00:48:26 <v Michael Kennedy>What's not.

00:48:27 <v Michael Kennedy>And it's tremendously successful.

00:48:28 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>There is a concern of sometimes you want memory from one chat.

00:48:32 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>Like sometimes a chat just degrades.

00:48:34 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>So start a new conversation.

00:48:35 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>And there are clever ways, different for different products and models, but to get it to summarize

00:48:40 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>the conversation so far, like literally say, I'm going to take another instance of you.

00:48:44 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>Let's squash this so I can pass the important memories to it and so on.

00:48:48 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>The other thing is Cursor, a lot of these products have, it used to be called YOLO mode on Cursor,

00:48:53 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>Like Y-O-L-O mode, right?

00:48:56 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>Where it just executes.

00:48:58 <v Michael Kennedy>I run in YOLO mode, by the way, I do it.

00:49:00 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>I have too much anxiety around that.

00:49:02 <v Michael Kennedy>So here's the thing that's really gotten <v Michael Kennedy>that I've really noticed that's interesting

00:49:06 <v Michael Kennedy>is my Git discipline is significantly better <v Michael Kennedy>now that I'm, if I do that.

00:49:13 <v Michael Kennedy>So I'll open it up and I'll go <v Michael Kennedy>and I'll start having a chat

00:49:16 <v Michael Kennedy>and I'll make sure everything is checked in.

00:49:18 <v Michael Kennedy>I might do a separate branch <v Michael Kennedy>if I think it's going to go bonkers.

00:49:21 <v Michael Kennedy>And then it'll do a little bit of work.

00:49:22 <v Michael Kennedy>And I'm like, okay, that's successful.

00:49:23 <v Michael Kennedy>So I'll stage those changes, but not even commit them.

00:49:26 <v Michael Kennedy>And then I'll let it keep going and it'll create more work.

00:49:29 <v Michael Kennedy>And I see if it's successful, I'll just like put, <v Michael Kennedy>and then eventually I'll commit it at the end.

00:49:33 <v Michael Kennedy>It won't even push it necessarily.

00:49:35 <v Michael Kennedy>And then you can also, while it's running, <v Michael Kennedy>have the get diff window open

00:49:39 <v Michael Kennedy>and you can just sort of see what it's doing <v Michael Kennedy>by looking at the diffs that start to appear.

00:49:43 <v Michael Kennedy>And so that's why I'm okay with YOLO mode <v Michael Kennedy>because I can always just get revert and we're fine again.

00:49:49 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>Totally.

00:49:50 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>And also, I didn't mention this, but these AI assistants are great at looking at diffs with you.

00:49:55 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>And I also, I'm really thinking through what happens when we have so much AI generated code.

00:50:01 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>And I think part of the future of work, I don't want to get too sci-fi-esque, but how many agents can you manage simultaneously?

00:50:08 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>Like maybe the SuperSpa employees will be people who can manage 100 agents.

00:50:12 <v Michael Kennedy>It's like the revenge of the program manager, I'm telling you.

00:50:15 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>And in fact, project management, product management are some of the most important skills moving forward.

00:50:20 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>But also when you have so many agents generating code, what happens to CICD?

00:50:24 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>What happens to Jenkins?

00:50:25 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>And there's going to be a whole new space of products and agents that may deal with these

00:50:31 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>types of systems, right?

00:50:32 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>Look during the industrial revolution, what sprung up when looms like appeared and the

00:50:37 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>satellite industries that happened there.

00:50:39 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>So I think we're talking about job automation, job automation and job displacement, but the

00:50:43 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>amount of new jobs that will become available, I'm actually very excited about.

00:50:48 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>And we'll put in the show notes, please.

00:50:50 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>But there's an essay by Tim O'Reilly.

00:50:52 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>And I did a podcast with him about it, actually, that we can link to if you're up for it, called

00:50:55 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>The End of Programming As We Know It.

00:50:57 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>OK.

00:50:59 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>And he essentially, with his great depth of historical knowledge and his forward thinking

00:51:04 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>through vectors, prevents a really wonderful vision and ideas around where software is

00:51:10 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>heading.

00:51:11 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>Exactly.

00:51:11 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>What about exploring data?

00:51:13 <v Michael Kennedy>So we've been talking about mostly writing data, testing, writing code, testing code in

00:51:18 <v Michael Kennedy>the context of data science, but I think it's actually really pretty powerful to say, here's a

00:51:23 <v Michael Kennedy>CSV. This is basically what it means. Let's start looking at, get me some graphs, pull me out some

00:51:29 <v Michael Kennedy>trends. What's important? What do you see that I didn't see? What do you think about this, like

00:51:34 <v Michael Kennedy>this exploratory analysis side of it? And that's not even, you know, that doesn't even worry you

00:51:38 <v Michael Kennedy>about like, is there maybe a bug in the code because I don't want to put it in production,

00:51:42 <v Michael Kennedy>right? It's just, it's fooling around to get a jumpstart on understanding.

00:51:45 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>So firstly, exploratory data analysis is one of a scientist's and data scientist's most important

00:51:51 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>jobs. So the question then becomes is how can we get AI to help us see what's happening that's so

00:51:57 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>integral to what we do? And the truth is they're wonderful. They can be wonderful at pulling out

00:52:02 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>insights that I just haven't noticed, or I don't even think about how to visualize. Now, if I ask

00:52:09 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>it to find the mean or median, it may suck at that on average, unless it writes the code to do so,

00:52:15 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>But when you get it to do EDA or exploratory data analysis, it will provide insights that I haven't thought of.

00:52:23 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>So one example I saw recently from a client was throwing in thousands of rows of customer data and website data of customers.

00:52:33 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>And it immediately showed clusters of high usage versus low usage.

00:52:39 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>You could see power users.

00:52:40 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>You could see power users who spent a lot on the platform.

00:52:43 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>You could see power users who didn't spend much on the platform.

00:52:46 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>And this is the type of work that takes hours for data scientists to sift through and develop

00:52:52 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>hypotheses around.

00:52:53 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>So when we're talking about, you know, data science is exploration and hypothesis driven,

00:52:58 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>right?

00:52:58 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>So when we're talking about exploration and hypothesis driven data science, it's wonderful

00:53:03 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>there.

00:53:04 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>And once again, this isn't to replace what we do, but it's to help us.

00:53:07 <v Michael Kennedy>It's having a thought partner, which is fast.

00:53:11 <v Michael Kennedy>Beyond the computer, a different bicycle of the mind.

00:53:13 <v Michael Kennedy>of a sort. Yeah. Maybe like a, maybe it's like an e-bike of the mind. What do you think?

00:53:17 <v Michael Kennedy>I love it.

00:53:17 <v Michael Kennedy>Yeah. E-bikes. I love e-bikes.

00:53:19 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>They're awesome. And I especially do because I live in Sydney, right? So getting to the beach,

00:53:24 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>it's actually quite hilly depending where, where you are. And the other thing I, yeah, when,

00:53:30 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>so hopefully we have time to talk about this, but something I do a lot of work on is what I call

00:53:35 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>evaluation driven development for LLM and AI powered applications where a really important part

00:53:41 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>of this is error analysis and failure analysis. So seeing where your applications fail. So let's

00:53:49 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>say we're building a chatbot, which is RAG. So it has some corpus of documents and it retrieves

00:53:54 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>stuff from it. And we want to interact with it. When we're building that, some of the first steps

00:54:00 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>and ongoing process is seeing what failure modes they are. Is it hallucinating or is it not

00:54:05 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>retrieving things correctly? Is it looking at the wrong documents? These types of things. And you do

00:54:10 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>that to drive the development and iterative process of AI powered software. Now you can also use AI

00:54:18 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>to look at that and look at the results in the data exploration. And it can really bring out a lot of

00:54:24 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>different failure modes. It can say, Hey, look at this cluster of conversations where the user

00:54:30 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>finally got the correct response, but they asked to be connected to a representative first,

00:54:35 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>and they didn't get connected to a representative. So this is actually an example where the conversation

00:54:39 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>looks like it's resolved. The support ticket was resolved or whatever it is, but there's a deep

00:54:44 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>failure mode within there. So AI can be very good in terms of the data exploration and hypothesis

00:54:50 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>driving process with that. So that was an example, but yeah, should we get into building LLM powered

00:54:56 <v Michael Kennedy>software? Yeah, sure. So I wonder whether you'd like to bring up the figure that I will talk

00:55:01 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>through because I know there'll be people listening and I'll share it in the chat with you. So this is

00:55:06 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>a slightly tongue-in-cheek figure. It speaks to real pain we have. So on the x-axis, we have time

00:55:11 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>and we're talking about building software. On the y-axis, we have excitement or dopamine, if you will,

00:55:16 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>if you want to measure it. And for the scientists out there, I apologize for not having units on my

00:55:20 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>axes, but it's all good. We know with traditional software, excitement increases over time. Things

00:55:26 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>are pretty boring at the start. You have a hello world and basic features and add unit tests,

00:55:30 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>then you scale and optimize and load balance. And over time, excitement increases and increases

00:55:34 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>and increases. This is absolutely inverted with generative AI powered software, right? Where you

00:55:39 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>have a flashy demo at the start. You're like, wow, check this out. Okay. Then you're like, oh, wait,

00:55:44 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>does it actually work? Or can someone else use it? And so you have issues with basic functionality

00:55:49 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>then. So excitement goes down. Then you're like, oh no, all these hallucinations, excitement goes

00:55:54 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>down. Then you have monitoring challenges. You're like, how can I even look at all my conversations

00:55:59 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>and tool calls and actions and this type of stuff? Excitement goes down. Then you have integration

00:56:03 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>issues? How do I integrate into my enterprise stack? Excitement goes down again. And I don't

00:56:07 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>think it's a coincidence that this is one of the most exciting technologies of a generation that's

00:56:14 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>totally addicted to Instagram as well, right? But the question is, and a lot of work I do,

00:56:18 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>is in helping people raise the curve, not change anything, not even change the excitement of the

00:56:23 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>flashy demo, but just make sure that excitement goes up and up and up as you build. And once again,

00:56:30 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>There's no free lunch.

00:56:30 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>You've got to do this the hard way, right?

00:56:33 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>So this is something, and a short plug for a course I teach,

00:56:36 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>but this is something I teach a lot on.

00:56:37 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>And I teach a Maven course, <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>building LM powered applications

00:56:41 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>for data science and software engineers <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>with my colleague, Stefan Krauchik,

00:56:45 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>who he works on agent infrastructure at Salesforce.

00:56:48 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>I bring a lot of the data and ML stuff.

00:56:50 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>He brings a lot of the ops stuff.

00:56:52 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>But yeah, in this course, <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>we teach a lot of these things.

00:56:56 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>And the way we do that, <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>one way to think about it is what we call evaluation-driven development. So that's not

00:57:03 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>necessarily having very sophisticated evals and tests and that type of stuff to start,

00:57:09 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>but it's about having a sense of where you want your product to go and having a sense of evaluation

00:57:16 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>of how to drive it in that direction. And the skillset that's required for this is so similar

00:57:22 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>to people who've built data science and ML powered products, right? So it's a curiosity to explore

00:57:28 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>data. It's a hacker mindset. It's experimenting with different tools. And what have we been doing

00:57:34 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>in the PyDataStack? I mean, look at the data viz landscape in Python. I think it was maybe PyCon

00:57:39 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>2018 that Jake Vanderplass, I think first time gave his talk, you know, data visualization in

00:57:44 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>Python. And, you know, there were so many tools one could use there. It's this type of mindset

00:57:49 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>you need. And then in terms of the product workflow, how you make sure you don't kind of go down this

00:57:56 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>curve, lose excitement in what I call proof of concept purgatory. People call the plateau of

00:58:00 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>productivity. There are all types of fun names about it. But what you do is you use the machine

00:58:06 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>learning mindset, which is get some data in and out of your system. If you don't have users yet,

00:58:11 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>you can generate synthetic data to do so, right? Then you label it, pass or fail initially. And

00:58:19 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>you give it a failure mode such as it was hallucination retrieval error wrong tool call

00:58:25 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>and a tool call essentially is what an agent does so an agent is an llm plus tool calls a tool call

00:58:30 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>could be ping an api send an email whatever it is agent plus tool call in some you know while loop

00:58:36 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>or for loop right and so you have did it did this particular interaction pass or fail what was the

00:58:43 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>failure mode and then how do I fix these particular failure modes? And I mean, one way to do this

00:58:49 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>initially, depending on the complexity of your system, is to put all of this in a spreadsheet

00:58:52 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>and do a pivot table. I know AI engineers hate it when I tell them to do pivot tables, but if you

00:58:57 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>rank order, use a pivot table to rank order your failure modes by frequency, then you can see what

00:59:03 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>to fix first. And if it's a retrieval error, maybe you want to fix the rag part of your system and

00:59:08 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>the retrieval part, right?

00:59:09 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>As opposed to the generative part.

00:59:11 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>So focus on your embeddings or chunks.

00:59:13 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>If it's a tool call, <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>focus on how that tool call is defined,

00:59:17 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>heuristics that the LLM uses there.

00:59:20 <v Michael Kennedy>A lot of the time, if you're doing...

00:59:21 <v Michael Kennedy>I would like to add, <v Michael Kennedy>well, this is great.

00:59:24 <v Michael Kennedy>I would like to add that <v Michael Kennedy>you can use those agentic coding tools

00:59:27 <v Michael Kennedy>to help build better analytics.

00:59:29 <v Michael Kennedy>Absolutely.

00:59:30 <v Michael Kennedy>Other support.

00:59:31 <v Michael Kennedy>So you're like, <v Michael Kennedy>God, we don't really have,

00:59:33 <v Michael Kennedy>we can't really track that, right?

00:59:34 <v Michael Kennedy>Like, well, give it half an hour <v Michael Kennedy>and you can, you know what I mean?

00:59:37 <v Michael Kennedy>Exactly.

00:59:37 <v Michael Kennedy>And so you got to kind of think out of the box and be a little creative there.

00:59:42 <v Michael Kennedy>Maybe build an MCP server that specializes in solving a specialized LLM that addresses

00:59:48 <v Michael Kennedy>a shortcoming that you can then force it to use the MCP server and work more constrained

00:59:52 <v Michael Kennedy>or whatever.

00:59:53 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>Exactly.

00:59:53 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>And as we kind of hinted at earlier, one of the wacky things here is that a lot of this

00:59:57 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>comes down to prompting.

00:59:58 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>And people like, should I fine tune or prompt engineer or rag or that type of stuff?

01:00:02 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>Prompt and prompt and prompt initially, because you can get so much lift by prompting.

01:00:08 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>Now, if it is actually a retrieval error, perhaps you want to improve your embeddings

01:00:13 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>or your chunking strategy or that type of stuff.

01:00:15 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>The other thing is, of course, data, metadata, data ingestion.

01:00:19 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>Draw an architectural diagram of your system where you see, you know, you have your RAG,

01:00:23 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>you have your output, you have your embeddings, you have your OCR, or if you've got PDS,

01:00:27 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>however you're ingesting your data, <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>a huge amount of the time,

01:00:30 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>fixing how you do your OCR on your PDFs <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>will be far more significant lift

01:00:36 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>than switching out to Claude Sonnet 4.5, okay?

01:00:40 <v Michael Kennedy>At that point, I totally understand <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>why people want to try the newest and sexiest model.

01:00:45 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>And I'm not telling people not to.

01:00:47 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>What I'm saying is focus on the fundamentals.

01:00:50 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>And then when you have this set of evals <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>of labeled data of what works, what doesn't,

01:00:57 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>You want a test set, essentially, right?

01:00:59 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>Like in machine learning.

01:01:00 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>So it's the same process.

01:01:02 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>You have this test set, your gold standard, which ideally covers, has coverage over all

01:01:06 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>your failure modes.

01:01:07 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>You want eval coverage.

01:01:09 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>Then when you switch out to a new model, you can see how it performed on your test set.

01:01:13 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>Imagine that.

01:01:14 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>Imagine being able to switch out a model and seeing what's up there.

01:01:18 <v Michael Kennedy>We will say it's better concretely with data, not just it feels better, which is often.

01:01:23 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>There are all these eval conversations about we don't want these evals.

01:01:26 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>We want online evals.

01:01:27 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>And then there are people do things only by vibes.

01:01:29 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>And all of these things are absolutely valid as well.

01:01:32 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>I think it's a healthy combination for whatever your product needs at any point in time.

01:01:36 <v Michael Kennedy>I do want to take just a couple minutes, literally, and get your thoughts on people coming into

01:01:41 <v Michael Kennedy>the industry.

01:01:42 <v Michael Kennedy>Data scientists who are just graduating now, or they got their first job, or they're about

01:01:47 <v Michael Kennedy>to get their first job.

01:01:48 <v Michael Kennedy>Like, I imagine this is something of a scary time.

01:01:50 <v Michael Kennedy>I think, well, now I'm not just competing with all the other people.

01:01:53 <v Michael Kennedy>Now these like AI things are biting against me getting a job as well.

01:01:57 <v Michael Kennedy>But I think it's both a blessing and a curse.

01:02:00 <v Michael Kennedy>What do you think?

01:02:00 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>Focus on three things.

01:02:02 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>What value you can deliver?

01:02:03 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>What's your skill as a data scientist?

01:02:05 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>And it is looking at data.

01:02:07 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>It is building and it is tying that to business value.

01:02:10 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>So if you focus on your skills and you build, build, build and consistently tie it to business

01:02:15 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>value, I think you'll go a long way.

01:02:18 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>And this actually speaks to how we think about evaluation more generally.

01:02:23 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>And I do want to give a shout out to a Sydney-based company called Lorikeet that they build customer support agents for all types of industries.

01:02:33 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>And when they do evaluation, they always evaluate was the ticket solved or not.

01:02:39 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>That's the most important evaluation.

01:02:40 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>It's not did this LLM call result in what we wanted it to be or anything along those lines.

01:02:45 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>Of course, once they see a failure, they tie it back to these more technical LLM-based failure modes.

01:02:53 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>But I wonder if, yeah, maybe Google Lorikeet AI or something like that.

01:02:58 <v Michael Kennedy>I had it in another tab.

01:02:59 <v Michael Kennedy>I don't know.

01:02:59 <v Michael Kennedy>I'll get it back.

01:03:00 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>One thing I love about, and I'm indexing on them.

01:03:03 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>There are lots of companies that do this.

01:03:05 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>But one thing that's very interesting about them is that their pricing model is ticket resolution based, right?

01:03:12 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>So if they've built a concierge or customer service agent for you, you pay based on how many tickets are resolved.

01:03:19 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>A lot of their competitors, their pricing is based on tokens, right?

01:03:22 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>Because that's what they pay for.

01:03:24 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>And in terms of aligning incentives, having it based around resolution is incredibly important for how you build as well.

01:03:32 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>And the reason, the question was, what should early stage data scientists focus on?

01:03:37 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>The reason I detoured on that story is supreme focus on business value, how your skills can be tied to business value via building stuff.

01:03:46 <v Michael Kennedy>It's great advice.

01:03:47 <v Michael Kennedy>And I will just throw one more thing out there for people is don't let these AI tools undercut your desire to actually learn the details.

01:03:56 <v Michael Kennedy>If you just go like, all right, I asked it and it gave me the answer and it just streamed by and you didn't pay attention, you're doing it wrong.

01:04:02 <v Michael Kennedy>You've got to stop, read, pay attention, question why did it do that.

01:04:06 <v Michael Kennedy>You can even ask it, why did you do this?

01:04:08 <v Michael Kennedy>Rather than that way, it might give you a documentation link.

01:04:11 <v Michael Kennedy>Like you got to stay active and it's so easy to just go next, next, next, because it's exciting

01:04:17 <v Michael Kennedy>that it's building something.

01:04:18 <v Michael Kennedy>Absolutely.

01:04:18 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>And I will add one other thing there, which is we need to carve out time.

01:04:22 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>These things won't always work.

01:04:24 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>You can spend a day working with AI and make less progress than if you'd done it yourself

01:04:28 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>as well.

01:04:28 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>I want to be very clear about that.

01:04:30 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>What we all need to do is figure out organizations we can work at, work with, and then time ourselves

01:04:36 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>to experiment with these seriously emerging <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>and rapidly changing technologies.

01:04:42 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>So it won't always be wins is my point.

01:04:45 <v Hugo Bowne-Anderson>So don't get discouraged when it isn't.

01:04:47 <v Michael Kennedy>Awesome, Hugo.
